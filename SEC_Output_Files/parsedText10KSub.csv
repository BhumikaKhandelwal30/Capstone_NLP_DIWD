"SILICON LABORATORIES INC","10-K","2018","1","Item 1.    Business General Silicon Laboratories Inc. is a leading provider of silicon, software and solutions for a smarter, more connected world. Our award-winning technologies are shaping the future of the Internet of Things (IoT), Internet infrastructure, industrial automation, consumer and automotive markets. Our world-class engineering team creates products focused on performance, energy savings, connectivity and simplicity. Our primary semiconductor products are mixed-signal integrated circuits (ICs), which are electronic components that convert real-world analog signals, such as sound and radio waves, into digital signals that electronic products can process. Our mixed-signal ICs leverage standard complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS), a low cost, widely available process technology. Use of CMOS technology enables smaller, more cost-effective and energy-efficient solutions. Our expertise in analog-intensive, mixed-signal IC design in CMOS allows us to develop new and innovative products that are highly integrated, simplifying our customers' designs and improving their time-to-market. Industry Background The pervasiveness of connectivity and mobile devices is driving semiconductor consumption. Intelligence is being added to electronic systems to enable Internet connectivity, power efficiency and an improved user experience. This in turn is increasing the demand for bandwidth, requiring more infrastructure to support higher performance networks. The nearly ubiquitous availability of Internet access and the increasing intelligence of electronic devices and mobility are enabling what is called the Internet of Things, a term that describes the exponential increase in IP-enabled devices connected to the Internet. These trends require more and more interaction between the analog world we live in and the digital world of computing, which is driving the need for analog-intensive, mixed-signal circuits in a wide range of electronic products. Traditional mixed-signal designs relied upon solutions built with numerous, complex discrete analog and digital components. While these traditional designs provide the required functionality, they are often inefficient and inadequate for use in markets where size, cost, power consumption and performance are increasingly important product differentiators. To improve their competitive position, electronics manufacturers must reduce the cost and complexity of their systems and enable new features or functionality to differentiate themselves from their competitors. Simultaneously, these manufacturers face accelerating time-to-market demands and must rapidly adapt to evolving industry standards and new technologies. Because analog-intensive, mixed-signal design expertise is difficult to find, these manufacturers increasingly are turning to third parties, like us, to provide advanced mixed-signal solutions. Mixed-signal design requires specific expertise and relies on creative, experienced engineers to deliver solutions that optimize speed, power and performance, despite the noisy digital environment, and within the constraints of standard manufacturing processes. The development of this design expertise typically requires years of practical analog design experience under the guidance of a senior engineer, and engineers with the required level of skill and expertise are in short supply. Many IC solution providers lack sufficient analog expertise to develop compelling mixed-signal products. As a result, manufacturers of electronic devices value providers that can supply them with mixed-signal solutions offering greater functionality, smaller size and lower power requirements at a reduced cost and shorter time-to-market. 2 Table of Contents Products We provide analog-intensive, mixed-signal solutions for use in a variety of electronic products in a broad range of applications for the IoT including connected home, smart lighting, security, wearables, smart energy and industrial applications.

The following summarizes our revenue by product category (in thousands): Fiscal Year         2017    2016    2015     Internet of Things     $ 395,012     $ 314,614     $ 262,329    Broadcast     152,980     157,746     161,787    Infrastructure     152,158     147,677     121,974    Access     68,717     77,589     98,736                                                                                 Revenues      $ 768,867     $ 697,626     $ 644,826 Customers, Sales and Marketing We market our products through our direct sales force and through a network of independent sales representatives and distributors. Direct and distributor customers buy on an individual purchase order basis, rather than pursuant to long-term agreements. We consider our customer to be the end customer purchasing either directly from a distributor, a contract manufacturer or us. During fiscal 2017, our ten largest end customers accounted for 20% of our revenues. We had no customer that represented more than 10% of our revenues during this period. An end customer purchasing through a contract manufacturer typically instructs such contract manufacturer to obtain our products and incorporate such products with other components for sale by such contract manufacturer to the end customer. Although we sell the products to, and are paid by distributors and contract manufacturers, we refer to such end customer as our customer. Three of our distributors who sell directly to our customers, Edom Technology, Avnet and Arrow Electronics, each represented 19%, 14% and 12% of our revenues during fiscal 2017, respectively. There were no contract manufacturers that accounted for 10% or more of revenues for fiscal 2017. We maintain numerous sales offices in Asia, the Americas and Europe. Revenue is attributed to a geographic area based on the shipped-to location. The percentage of our revenues derived from outside of the United States was 85% in fiscal 2017. For further information regarding our revenues and long-lived assets by geographic area, see Note 17, Segment Information, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Our direct sales force is comprised of many sales professionals who possess varied levels of responsibility and experience, including directors, country managers, regional sales managers, district sales managers, strategic account managers, field sales engineers and sales representatives. We also utilize independent sales representatives and distributors to generate sales of our products. We have relationships with many independent sales representatives and distributors worldwide whom we have selected based on their understanding of the mixed-signal marketplace and their ability to provide effective field sales applications support for our products. Our marketing efforts are targeted at both identified industry leaders and emerging market participants. Direct marketing activities are supplemented by a focused marketing communications effort that seeks to raise awareness of our company and products. Our public relations efforts are focused on leading trade and business publications. Our external website is used to deliver corporate and product information. We also pursue targeted advertising in key trade publications and we have a cooperative marketing program that allows our distributors and representatives to promote our products to their local markets in conjunction with their own advertising activities. Finally, we maintain a presence at strategic trade shows and industry events. These activities, in combination with direct sales activities, help drive demand for our products. 7 Table of Contents Due to the complex and innovative nature of our products, we employ experienced applications engineers who work closely with customers and distributors to support the design-win process, and can significantly accelerate the customer's time to market. A design win occurs when a customer has designed our ICs into its product architecture and ordered product from us. A considerable amount of effort to help a customer incorporate our ICs into its products is typically required prior to any sale. In many cases, our innovative ICs require significantly different implementations than existing approaches and, therefore, successful implementations may require extensive communication with potential customers. The amount of time required to achieve a design win can vary substantially depending on a customer's development cycle, which can be relatively short (such as three months) or very long (such as two years) based on a wide variety of customer factors. Not all design wins ultimately result in revenue, or may result in less revenue than expected. However, once a completed design architecture has been implemented and produced in high volumes, our customers are reluctant to significantly alter their designs due to this extensive design-win process. We believe this process, coupled with our intellectual property protection, promotes relatively longer product life cycles for our products and high barriers to entry for competitive products, even if such competing products are offered at lower prices. Our close collaboration with our customers provides us with knowledge of derivative product ideas or completely new product line offerings that may not otherwise arise in other new product discussions. Research and Development Through our research and development efforts, we leverage experienced analog and mixed-signal engineering talent and expertise to create new ICs that integrate functions typically performed less efficiently by multiple discrete components. This integration generally results in lower costs, smaller die sizes, lower power demands and enhanced price/performance characteristics. We attempt to reuse successful techniques for integration in new applications where similar benefits can be realized. We believe that we have attracted many of the best engineers in our industry. We believe that reliable and precise analog and mixed-signal ICs can only be developed by teams of engineers who have significant analog experience and are familiar with the intricacies of designing these ICs for commercial volume production. The development of test methodologies is just one example of a critical activity requiring experience and know-how to enable the rapid release of a new product for commercial success. We have accumulated a vast set of trade secrets that allow us to pursue innovative approaches to mixed-signal problems that are difficult for competitors to duplicate. We highly value our engineering talent and strive to maintain a very high bar when bringing new recruits to the company. Research and development expenses were $209.5 million, $199.7 million and $188.1 million in fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Technology Our product development process facilitates the design of highly-innovative, analog-intensive, mixed-signal ICs. Our engineers' deep knowledge of existing and emerging standards and performance requirements helps us to assess the technical feasibility of a particular IC. We target areas where we can provide compelling product improvements. Once we have solved the primary challenges, our field application engineers continue to work closely with our customers' design teams to maintain and develop an understanding of our customers' needs, allowing us to formulate derivative products and refined features. In providing mixed-signal ICs for our customers, we believe our key competitive advantages are: <U+0095> Analog and RF design expertise in CMOS;    <U+0095> Mixed-signal, firmware and system design expertise;    <U+0095> Microcontroller and system on a chip design expertise; 8 Table of Contents <U+0095> Software expertise, including multiprotocol connectivity and real-time operating systems for the IoT;     <U+0095> Module integration and wireless design expertise; and    <U+0095> Our broad understanding of systems technology and trends. To fully capitalize on these advantages, we have assembled a world-class development team with exceptional analog and mixed-signal design expertise led by accomplished senior engineers. Analog and RF Design Expertise in CMOS We believe that our most significant core competency is world-class analog and RF design capability. Additionally, we strive to design substantially all our ICs in standard CMOS processes. Most of our product designs now incorporate some type of RF in CMOS technology. While it is often significantly more difficult to design analog ICs in CMOS, CMOS provides multiple benefits versus existing alternatives, including significantly reduced cost, reduced technology risk and greater worldwide foundry capacity. CMOS is the most commonly used process technology for manufacturing digital ICs and as a result is most likely to be used for the manufacturing of ICs with finer line geometries. These finer line geometries can enable smaller and faster ICs. By designing our ICs in CMOS, we enable our products to benefit from this trend towards finer line geometries, which allows us to integrate more digital functionality into our mixed-signal ICs. Designing analog and mixed-signal ICs is significantly more complicated than designing standalone digital ICs. While advanced software tools exist to help automate digital IC design, there are far fewer tools for advanced analog and mixed-signal IC design. In many cases, our analog circuit design efforts begin at the fundamental transistor level. We believe that we have a demonstrated ability to design the most difficult analog and RF circuits using standard CMOS technologies. Mixed-Signal, Firmware and System Design Expertise We consider the partitioning of a circuit to be a proprietary and creative design technique. Deep systems knowledge allows us to use our mixed-signal and RF in CMOS design expertise to maximize the price/performance characteristics of both the analog and digital functions and allow our ICs to work in an optimized manner to accomplish particular tasks. Generally, we attempt to move analog functions into the digital domain as quickly as possible, creating system efficiencies without compromising performance. These patented approaches require our advanced signal processing and systems expertise. We then leverage our firmware know-how to change the 'personality' of our devices, optimizing features and functions needed by various markets we serve. For example, our wireless SoC devices for IoT applications integrate both digital and analog domains in a single chip. The SoCs combine ARM Cortex-M processor cores, a variety of digital and analog peripherals, hardware cryptography accelerators, and analog-intensive multiprotocol radio transceivers. This system integration at the chip level leverages our deep expertise in mixed-signal and RF design, and low-power wireless MCU architectures pioneered for more than a decade. Microcontroller and System on a Chip Design Expertise We have the talent and circuit integration methodologies required to combine precision analog, high-speed digital, flash memory and in-system programmability into a single, monolithic CMOS integrated circuit. Our microcontroller products are designed to capture an external analog signal, convert it to a digital signal, compute digital functions on the stream of data and then communicate the results through a standard digital interface. The ability to develop standard products with the broadest possible customer application base while being cost efficient with the silicon area of the monolithic CMOS integrated circuit requires a keen sense of customer value and engineering capabilities. 9 Table of Contents Additionally, to manage the wide variety of signals on a monolithic piece of silicon including electrical noise, harmonics and other electronic distortions requires a fundamental knowledge of device physics and accumulated design expertise. Software Expertise Our software expertise allows us to develop products for markets where intelligent data capture, high-performance processing and communication are increasingly important product differentiators. The software we have developed to address these markets enables machine-to-machine communications, providing intelligence to electronic systems. Our products integrate high-performance, low-power wireless and microcontroller ICs with reliable and scalable software into a flexible and robust networking platform. The demand for low-power, small-footprint wireless technology is accelerating as more and more IP-enabled end points are being connected to the IoT. Our software enables a broad range of power-sensitive applications for the IoT, including smart energy, home automation, security and other connected products. We believe that the combination of our software and IC design expertise differentiates us from many of our competitors. As the IoT continues to mature, a new class of embedded applications is emerging, presenting feature-rich and task-intensive use cases. This growing complexity is driving the need for real-time operating systems to help simplify software development for IoT applications by coordinating and prioritizing multiprotocol connectivity, SoC peripherals and other system-level activities. In addition to being able to manage numerous application tasks, an RTOS enhances scalability, and makes complex applications predictable and reliable. To address these application needs, we acquired Micrium, an embedded RTOS provider. Micrium has established itself as a reliable, high performance and trusted RTOS software platform, with an installed base that has grown to millions of devices. Module Integration and Wireless Design Expertise The market for wireless modules has grown as customers search for solutions that provide turnkey wireless connectivity to their products. The development of modules is difficult due to stringent requirements, including high levels of integration, programmability, performance, reliability, security and power efficiency. In addition, designs must meet numerous wireless standards deployed in various environments and serving diverse requirements. Our combined expertise in IC design and software development allows us to engineer modules that provide robust, high-performance connections in challenging wireless environments. We have developed wireless modules based on numerous wireless standards, including Bluetooth, Zigbee, Thread, Wi-Fi and sub-GHz. We believe our demonstrated proficiency in the design of modules provides our customers with significant advantages such as fast time to market, reduced development cost, global wireless certifications and software reuse. Understanding of Systems Technology and Trends Our focused expertise in mixed-signal ICs is the result of the breadth of engineering talent we have assembled with experience working in analog-intensive CMOS design for a wide variety of applications. This expertise, which we consider a competitive advantage, is the foundation of our in-depth understanding of the technology and trends that impact electronic systems and markets. Our expertise includes: <U+0095> Isolation, which is critical for existing and emerging industrial applications and telecom networks;     <U+0095> Frequency synthesis, which is core technology for wireless and clocking applications; 10 Table of Contents <U+0095> Integration, which enables the elimination of discrete components in a system; and    <U+0095> Signal processing and precision analog, which forms the heart of consumer, industrial, medical and automotive electronics applications. Our understanding of the role of analog/digital interfaces within electronic systems, standards evolution, and end market drivers enables us to identify product development opportunities and capitalize on market trends. Manufacturing As a fabless semiconductor company, we conduct IC design and development in our facilities and electronically transfer our proprietary IC designs to third-party semiconductor fabricators who process silicon wafers to produce the ICs that we design. Our IC designs typically use industry-standard CMOS manufacturing process technology to achieve a level of performance normally associated with more expensive special-purpose IC fabrication technology. We believe the use of CMOS technology facilitates the rapid production of our ICs within a lower cost framework. Our IC production employs submicron process geometries which are readily available from leading foundry suppliers worldwide, thus increasing the likelihood that manufacturing capacity will be available throughout our products' life cycles. We currently partner with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) or TSMC's affiliates and Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation (SMIC) to manufacture the majority of our semiconductor wafers. We believe that our fabless manufacturing model significantly reduces our capital requirements and allows us to focus our resources on design, development and marketing of our ICs. Once the silicon wafers have been produced, they are shipped directly to our third-party assembly subcontractors. The assembled ICs are then moved to the final testing stage. This operation can be performed by the same contractor that assembled the IC, other third-party test subcontractors or within our internal facilities prior to shipping to our customers. During fiscal 2017, most of our units shipped were tested by offshore third-party test subcontractors. We expect that our utilization of offshore third-party test subcontractors will remain substantial during fiscal 2018. Backlog We include in backlog accepted product purchase orders from customers and worldwide distributor stocking orders. Product orders in our backlog are subject to changes in delivery schedules or cancellation at the option of the purchaser typically without penalty. Our backlog may fluctuate significantly depending upon customer order patterns which may, in turn, vary considerably based on rapidly changing business circumstances. Accordingly, we do not believe that our backlog at any time is necessarily representative of actual sales for any succeeding period. Competition The markets for semiconductors generally, and for analog and mixed-signal ICs in particular, are intensely competitive. We anticipate that the market for our products will continually evolve and will be subject to rapid technological change. We believe the principal competitive factors in our industry are: <U+0095> Product size;             <U+0095> Power requirement;              <U+0095> Level of integration;             <U+0095>  Customer support;              <U+0095> Product capabilities;             <U+0095>  Reputation;             <U+0095>  Reliability;             <U+0095> Ability to rapidly introduce new products to market;             <U+0095> Price;             <U+0095>  Intellectual property; and             <U+0095>  Performance;             <U+0095>  Software. 11 Table of Contents We believe that we are competitive with respect to these factors, particularly because our ICs typically are smaller in size, are highly integrated, achieve high performance specifications at lower price points than competitive products and are manufactured in standard CMOS which generally enables us to supply them on a relatively rapid basis to customers to meet their product introduction schedules. However, disadvantages we face include our relatively short operating history in certain of our markets and the need for customers to redesign their products and modify their software to implement our ICs in their products. Due to our diversified product portfolio and the numerous markets and applications we serve, we target a relatively large number of competitors. We compete with Analog Devices, Broadcom, Cypress, IDT, Infineon, Maxim Integrated Products, MaxLinear, Microchip, Microsemi, Nordic Semiconductor, NXP Semiconductors, Qualcomm, Renesas, STMicroelectronics, Synaptics, Texas Instruments and others. We expect to face competition in the future from our current competitors, other manufacturers and designers of semiconductors and start-up semiconductor design companies. Our competitors may also offer bundled solutions offering a more complete product, which may negatively impact our competitive position despite the technical merits or advantages of our products. In addition, our customers could develop products or technologies internally that would replace their need for our products and would become a source of competition. We could also face competition from module makers or other systems suppliers that may include mixed-signal components in their products that could eliminate the need for our ICs. Many of our competitors and potential competitors have longer operating histories, greater name recognition, access to larger customer bases, complementary product offerings, and significantly greater financial, sales and marketing, manufacturing, distribution, technical and other resources than us. Current and potential competitors have established or may establish financial and strategic relationships between themselves or with our existing or potential customers, resellers or other third parties. Accordingly, it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors could emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share. Intellectual Property Our future success depends in part upon our proprietary technology. We seek to protect our technology through a combination of patents, copyrights, trade secrets, trademarks and confidentiality procedures. As of December 30, 2017, we had approximately 1,634 issued or pending United States and foreign patents. There can be no assurance that patents will ever be issued with respect to our patent applications. Furthermore, it is possible that any patents held by us may be invalidated, circumvented, challenged or licensed to others. In addition, there can be no assurance that such patents will provide us with competitive advantages or adequately safeguard our proprietary rights. While we continue to file new patent applications with respect to our recent developments, existing patents are granted for prescribed time periods and will expire at various times in the future. We claim copyright protection for proprietary documentation for our products. We have filed for registration, or are in the process of filing for registration, the visual images of certain ICs with the U.S. Copyright Office. We have registered the ""Silicon Labs"" logo and a variety of other product and product family names as trademarks in the United States and selected foreign jurisdictions. All other trademarks, service marks or trade names appearing in this report are the property of their respective owners. We also attempt to protect our trade secrets and other proprietary information through agreements with our customers, suppliers, employees and consultants, and through other customary security measures. We intend to protect our rights vigorously, but there can be no assurance that our efforts will be successful. In addition, the laws of other countries in which our products are sold may not protect our products and intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. 12 Table of Contents While our ability to effectively compete depends in large part on our ability to protect our intellectual property, we believe that our technical expertise and ability to introduce new products in a timely manner will be an important factor in maintaining our competitive position. Many participants in the semiconductor and electronics industries have a significant number of patents and have frequently demonstrated a readiness to commence litigation based on allegations of patent and other intellectual property infringement. From time to time, third parties may assert infringement claims against us. We may not prevail in any such litigation or may not be able to license any valid and infringed patents from third parties on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. Litigation, regardless of the outcome, is likely to result in substantial cost and diversion of our resources, including our management's time. Any such litigation could materially adversely affect us. Our licenses include industry standard licenses with our vendors, such as wafer fabrication tool libraries, third-party core libraries, computer-aided design applications and business software applications. Employees As of December 30, 2017, we employed 1,279 people. Our success depends on the continued service of our key technical and senior management personnel and on our ability to continue to attract, retain and motivate highly skilled analog and mixed-signal engineers. The competition for such personnel is intense. We have never had a work stoppage and none of our U.S. employees are represented by a labor organization. We consider our employee relations to be good. Environmental Regulation Federal, state and local regulations impose various environmental controls on the storage, use, discharge and disposal of certain chemicals and gases used in the semiconductor industry. Our compliance with these laws and regulations has not had a material impact on our financial position or results of operations. Available Information Our website address is www.silabs.com.

Risk Factors Risks Related to our Business We may not be able to maintain our historical growth and may experience significant period-to-period fluctuations in our revenues and operating results, which may result in volatility in our stock price Although we have generally experienced revenue growth in our history, we may not be able to sustain this growth. We may also experience significant period-to-period fluctuations in our revenues and operating results in the future due to a number of factors, and any such variations may cause our stock price to fluctuate. In some future period our revenues or operating results may be below the expectations of public market analysts or investors. If this occurs, our stock price may drop, perhaps significantly. 13 Table of Contents A number of factors, in addition to those cited in other risk factors applicable to our business, may contribute to fluctuations in our revenues and operating results, including: <U+0095> The timing and volume of orders received from our customers;    <U+0095> The timeliness of our new product introductions and the rate at which our new products may cannibalize our older products;     <U+0095> The rate of acceptance of our products by our customers, including the acceptance of new products we may develop for integration in the products manufactured by such customers, which we refer to as ""design wins"";    <U+0095> The time lag and realization rate between ""design wins"" and production orders;    <U+0095> The demand for, and life cycles of, the products incorporating our mixed-signal solutions;    <U+0095> The rate of adoption of mixed-signal products in the markets we target;    <U+0095> Deferrals or reductions of customer orders in anticipation of new products or product enhancements from us or our competitors or other providers of mixed-signal ICs;    <U+0095> Changes in product mix;    <U+0095> The average selling prices for our products could drop suddenly due to competitive offerings or competitive predatory pricing;     <U+0095> The average selling prices for our products generally decline over time;    <U+0095> Changes in market standards;    <U+0095> Impairment charges related to inventory, equipment or other long-lived assets;    <U+0095> The software used in our products, including software provided by third parties, may not meet the needs of our customers;     <U+0095> Significant legal costs to defend our intellectual property rights or respond to claims against us; and     <U+0095> The rate at which new markets emerge for products we are currently developing or for which our design expertise can be utilized to develop products for these new markets. The markets for consumer electronics, for example, are characterized by rapid fluctuations in demand and seasonality that result in corresponding fluctuations in the demand for our products that are incorporated in such devices. Additionally, the rate of technology acceptance by our customers results in fluctuating demand for our products as customers are reluctant to incorporate a new IC into their products until the new IC has achieved market acceptance. Once a new IC achieves market acceptance, demand for the new IC can quickly accelerate to a point and then level off such that rapid historical growth in sales of a product should not be viewed as indicative of continued future growth. In addition, demand can quickly decline for a product when a new IC product is introduced and receives market acceptance. Due to the various factors mentioned above, the results of any prior quarterly or annual periods should not be relied upon as an indication of our future operating performance. If we are unable to develop or acquire new and enhanced products that achieve market acceptance in a timely manner, our operating results and competitive position could be harmed Our future success will depend on our ability to develop or acquire new products and product enhancements that achieve market acceptance in a timely and cost-effective manner. The development of mixed-signal ICs is highly complex, and we have at times experienced delays in completing the 14 Table of Contents development and introduction of new products and product enhancements. Successful product development and market acceptance of our products depend on a number of factors, including: <U+0095> Requirements of customers;    <U+0095> Accurate prediction of market and technical requirements;    <U+0095> Timely completion and introduction of new designs;    <U+0095> Timely qualification and certification of our products for use in our customers' products;    <U+0095> Commercial acceptance and volume production of the products into which our ICs will be incorporated;     <U+0095> Availability of foundry, assembly and test capacity;    <U+0095> Achievement of high manufacturing yields;    <U+0095> Quality, price, performance, power use and size of our products;    <U+0095> Availability, quality, price and performance of competing products and technologies;    <U+0095> Our customer service, application support capabilities and responsiveness;    <U+0095> Successful development of our relationships with existing and potential customers;    <U+0095> Technology, industry standards or end-user preferences; and    <U+0095> Cooperation of third-party software providers and our semiconductor vendors to support our chips within a system. We cannot provide any assurance that products which we recently have developed or may develop in the future will achieve market acceptance. We have introduced to market or are in development of many products. If our products fail to achieve market acceptance, or if we fail to develop new products on a timely basis that achieve market acceptance, our growth prospects, operating results and competitive position could be adversely affected. The growth of the IoT market is dependent on the adoption of industry standards to permit devices to connect and communicate with each other. If the industry cannot agree on a common set of standards, then the growth of the IoT market may be slower than expected. Our research and development efforts are focused on a limited number of new technologies and products, and any delay in the development, or abandonment, of these technologies or products by industry participants, or their failure to achieve market acceptance, could compromise our competitive position Our products serve as components and solutions in electronic devices in various markets. As a result, we have devoted and expect to continue to devote a large amount of resources to develop products based on new and emerging technologies and standards that will be commercially introduced in the future. Research and development expense during fiscal 2017 was $209.5 million, or 27.2% of revenues. A number of companies are actively involved in the development of these new technologies and standards. Should any of these companies delay or abandon their efforts to develop commercially available products based on new technologies and standards, our research and development efforts with respect to these technologies and standards likely would have no appreciable value. In addition, if we do not correctly anticipate new technologies and standards, or if the products that we develop based on these new technologies and standards fail to achieve market acceptance, our competitors may be better able to address market demand than we would. Furthermore, if markets for these new technologies and standards develop later than we anticipate, or do not develop at all, demand for our products that are currently in development would suffer, resulting in lower sales of these products than we currently anticipate. 15 Table of Contents Significant litigation over intellectual property in our industry may cause us to become involved in costly and lengthy litigation which could seriously harm our business In recent years, there has been significant litigation in the United States involving patents and other intellectual property rights. From time to time, we receive letters from various industry participants alleging infringement of patents, trademarks or misappropriation of trade secrets or from customers or suppliers requesting indemnification for claims brought against them by third parties. The exploratory nature of these inquiries has become relatively common in the semiconductor industry. We respond when we deem appropriate and as advised by legal counsel. We have been involved in litigation to protect our intellectual property rights in the past and may become involved in such litigation again in the future. We are currently involved in litigation in which we and certain of our customers have been accused of patent infringement related to our television tuner products. In the future, we may become involved in additional litigation to defend allegations of infringement asserted by others, both directly and indirectly as a result of certain industry-standard indemnities we may offer to our customers or suppliers. Legal proceedings could subject us to significant liability for damages or invalidate our proprietary rights. Legal proceedings initiated by us to protect our intellectual property rights could also result in counterclaims or countersuits against us. Any litigation, regardless of its outcome, would likely be time-consuming and expensive to resolve and would divert our management's time and attention. Intellectual property litigation also could force us to take specific actions, including: <U+0095> Cease selling or manufacturing products that use the challenged intellectual property;    <U+0095> Obtain from the owner of the infringed intellectual property a right to a license to sell or use the relevant technology, which license may not be available on reasonable terms, or at all;    <U+0095> Redesign those products that use infringing intellectual property; or    <U+0095> Pursue legal remedies with third parties to enforce our indemnification rights, which may not adequately protect our interests. Any acquisitions we make could disrupt our business and harm our financial condition As part of our growth and product diversification strategy, we continue to evaluate opportunities to acquire other businesses, intellectual property or technologies that would complement our current offerings, expand the breadth of our markets or enhance our technical capabilities. The acquisitions that we have made and may make in the future entail a number of risks that could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results, including: <U+0095> Problems integrating the acquired operations, technologies or products with our existing business and products;     <U+0095> Diversion of management's time and attention from our core business;    <U+0095> Need for financial resources above our planned investment levels;    <U+0095> Difficulties in retaining business relationships with suppliers and customers of the acquired company;     <U+0095> Risks associated with entering markets in which we lack prior experience;    <U+0095> Risks associated with the transfer of licenses of intellectual property;    <U+0095> Increased operating costs due to acquired overhead;    <U+0095> Tax issues associated with acquisitions;    <U+0095> Acquisition-related disputes, including disputes over earn-outs and escrows;    <U+0095> Potential loss of key employees of the acquired company; and 16 Table of Contents <U+0095> Potential impairment of related goodwill and intangible assets. Future acquisitions also could cause us to incur debt or contingent liabilities or cause us to issue equity securities that could negatively impact the ownership percentages of existing shareholders. Our proposed acquisition of the Z-Wave business of Sigma Designs, Inc. is contingent upon approval by Sigma Designs' stockholders and may not be consummated. In the event the acquisition is consummated, the integration of the Z-Wave business with our own may be more difficult, costly or time consuming than expected, and the anticipated benefits and cost savings of the acquisition may not be fully realized, which could adversely impact our business operations, financial condition and results of operations. On December 7, 2017 we entered into an agreement with Sigma Designs pursuant to which we expect to acquire its Z-Wave business. See Note 8, Acquisitions, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. The proposed acquisition is subject to the satisfaction of a number of closing conditions, including the approval of the stockholders of Sigma Designs and the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting periods under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 and the rules thereunder and there can be no assurance that these conditions will be satisfied. In the event the acquisition of the Z-Wave business is consummated, the success of the acquisition, including the achievement of anticipated benefits and cost savings, is subject to a number of uncertainties and will depend, in part, on our ability to successfully combine and integrate the Z-Wave business into our own core business in an efficient and effective manner. Potential difficulties that we may encounter include the following, any of which could result in the anticipated benefits of the acquisition not being realized or harm our operations or financial condition: <U+0095> The inability to successfully integrate the Z-Wave business into our own in a manner that permits us to achieve the cost savings and operating synergies anticipated from the acquisition;    <U+0095> The integration of the Z-Wave business may create a diversion of management's time and attention from our core business, or disrupt our current plans and operations;    <U+0095> The loss of key management or technical personnel necessary for the continued operation of the Z-Wave business or our core business, particularly our experienced engineers;    <U+0095> Integrating personnel, IT systems and corporate, finance and administrative infrastructures of the Z-Wave business with our own while maintaining focus on providing consistent, high quality products and services;    <U+0095> Coordinating and integrating our internal operations, compensation programs, policies and procedures, and corporate structures;     <U+0095> Potential unknown liabilities and unforeseen or increased costs and expenses, including unforeseen litigation; and     <U+0095> The possibility of faulty assumptions underlying expectations regarding potential synergies and the integration process. Any of these factors could result in our failing to realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition of the Z-Wave business, on the expected timeline or at all, and could adversely impact our business operations and operating results. We may be unable to protect our intellectual property, which would negatively affect our ability to compete Our products rely on our proprietary technology, and we expect that future technological advances made by us will be critical to sustain market acceptance of our products. Therefore, we believe that the protection of our intellectual property rights is and will continue to be important to the success of our 17 Table of Contents business. We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws and restrictions on disclosure to protect our intellectual property rights. We also enter into confidentiality or license agreements with our employees, consultants, intellectual property providers and business partners, and control access to and distribution of our documentation and other proprietary information. Despite these efforts, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain and use our proprietary technology. Monitoring unauthorized use of our technology is difficult, and we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent unauthorized use of our technology, particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the United States. We cannot be certain that patents will be issued as a result of our pending applications nor can we be certain that any issued patents would protect or benefit us or give us adequate protection from competing products. For example, issued patents may be circumvented or challenged and declared invalid or unenforceable. We also cannot be certain that others will not develop effective competing technologies on their own. Failure to manage our distribution channel relationships could impede our future growth The future growth of our business will depend in large part on our ability to manage our relationships with current and future distributors and sales representatives, develop additional channels for the distribution and sale of our products and manage these relationships. During fiscal 2017, 71% of our revenue was derived from distributors. As we execute our indirect sales strategy, we must manage the potential conflicts that may arise with our direct sales efforts. For example, conflicts with a distributor may arise when a customer begins purchasing directly from us rather than through the distributor. The inability to successfully execute or manage a multi-channel sales strategy could impede our future growth. In addition, relationships with our distributors often involve the use of price protection and inventory return rights. This often requires a significant amount of sales management's time and system resources to manage properly. We depend on a limited number of customers for a significant portion of our revenues, and the loss of, or a significant reduction in orders from, any key customer could significantly reduce our revenues The loss of any of our key customers, or a significant reduction in sales to any one of them, would significantly reduce our revenues and adversely affect our business. During fiscal 2017, our ten largest customers accounted for 20% of our revenues. Some of the markets for our products are dominated by a small number of potential customers. Therefore, our operating results in the foreseeable future will continue to depend on our ability to sell to these dominant customers, as well as the ability of these customers to sell products that incorporate our IC products. In the future, these customers may decide not to purchase our products at all, purchase fewer products than they did in the past or alter their purchasing patterns, particularly because: <U+0095> We do not have material long-term purchase contracts with our customers;    <U+0095> Substantially all of our sales to date have been made on a purchase order basis, which permits our customers to cancel, change or delay product purchase commitments with little or no notice to us and without penalty;    <U+0095> Some of our customers may have efforts underway to actively diversify their vendor base which could reduce purchases of our products; and     <U+0095> Some of our customers have developed or acquired products that compete directly with products these customers purchase from us, which could affect our customers' purchasing decisions in the future. 18 Table of Contents Our customers regularly evaluate alternative sources of supply in order to diversify their supplier base, which increases their negotiating leverage with us and protects their ability to secure these components. We believe that any expansion of our customers' supplier bases could have an adverse effect on the prices we are able to charge and volume of product that we are able to sell to our customers, which would negatively affect our revenues and operating results. We are subject to increased inventory risks and costs because we build our products based on forecasts provided by customers before receiving purchase orders for the products In order to ensure availability of our products for some of our largest customers, we start the manufacturing of our products in advance of receiving purchase orders based on forecasts provided by these customers. However, these forecasts do not represent binding purchase commitments and we do not recognize sales for these products until they are shipped to the customer. As a result, we incur inventory and manufacturing costs in advance of anticipated sales. Because demand for our products may not materialize, manufacturing based on forecasts subjects us to increased risks of high inventory carrying costs, increased obsolescence and increased operating costs. These inventory risks are exacerbated when our customers purchase indirectly through contract manufacturers or hold component inventory levels greater than their consumption rate because this causes us to have less visibility regarding the accumulated levels of inventory for such customers. A resulting write-off of unusable or excess inventories would adversely affect our operating results. Our products are complex and may contain errors which could lead to liability, an increase in our costs and/or a reduction in our revenues Our products are complex and may contain errors, particularly when first introduced and/or when new versions are released. Our products are increasingly designed in more complex processes, including higher levels of software and hardware integration in modules and system-level solutions and/or include elements provided by third parties which further increase the risk of errors. We rely primarily on our in-house testing personnel to design test operations and procedures to detect any errors or vulnerabilities prior to delivery of our products to our customers. Should problems occur in the operation or performance of our products, we may experience delays in meeting key introduction dates or scheduled delivery dates to our customers. These errors could also cause significant re-engineering costs, the diversion of our engineering personnel's attention from our product development efforts and cause significant customer relations and business reputation problems. Any defects could result in refunds, product replacement, product recall or other liability. Any of the foregoing could impose substantial costs and harm our business. Product liability, data breach or cyber liability claims may be asserted with respect to our products. Many of our products focus on wireless connectivity and the IoT market and such connectivity may make these products particularly susceptible to cyber-attacks. Our products are typically sold at prices that are significantly lower than the cost of the end-products into which they are incorporated. A defect, failure or vulnerability in our product could cause failure in our customer's end-product, so we could face claims for damages that are disproportionately higher than the revenues and profits we receive from the products involved. Furthermore, product liability risks are particularly significant with respect to medical and automotive applications because of the risk of serious harm to users of these end-products. There can be no assurance that any insurance we maintain will sufficiently protect us from such claims. 19 Table of Contents We rely on third parties to manufacture, assemble and test our products and the failure to successfully manage our relationships with our manufacturers and subcontractors would negatively impact our ability to sell our products We do not have our own wafer fab manufacturing facilities. Therefore, we rely on third-party vendors to manufacture the products we design. We also currently rely on Asian third-party assembly subcontractors to assemble and package the silicon chips provided by the wafers for use in final products. Additionally, we rely on these offshore subcontractors for a substantial portion of the testing requirements of our products prior to shipping. We expect utilization of third-party subcontractors to continue in the future. The cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry drives wide fluctuations in available capacity at third-party vendors. On occasion, we have been unable to adequately respond to unexpected increases in customer demand due to capacity constraints and, therefore, were unable to benefit from this incremental demand. We may be unable to obtain adequate foundry, assembly or test capacity from our third-party subcontractors to meet our customers' delivery requirements even if we adequately forecast customer demand. There are significant risks associated with relying on these third-party foundries and subcontractors, including: <U+0095> Failure by us, our customers or their end customers to qualify a selected supplier;    <U+0095> Potential insolvency of the third-party subcontractors;    <U+0095> Reduced control over delivery schedules and quality;    <U+0095> Limited warranties on wafers or products supplied to us;    <U+0095> Potential increases in prices or payments in advance for capacity;    <U+0095> Increased need for international-based supply, logistics and financial management;    <U+0095> Their inability to supply or support new or changing packaging technologies; and    <U+0095> Low test yields. We typically do not have long-term supply contracts with our third-party vendors which obligate the vendor to perform services and supply products to us for a specific period, in specific quantities, and at specific prices. Our third-party foundry, assembly and test subcontractors typically do not guarantee that adequate capacity will be available to us within the time required to meet demand for our products. In the event that these vendors fail to meet our demand for whatever reason, we expect that it would take up to 12 months to transition performance of these services to new providers. Such a transition may also require qualification of the new providers by our customers or their end customers. Most of the silicon wafers for the products that we have sold were manufactured either by TSMC or TSMC's affiliates or by SMIC. Our customers typically complete their own qualification process. If we fail to properly balance customer demand across the existing semiconductor fabrication facilities that we utilize or are required by our foundry partners to increase, or otherwise change the number of fab lines that we utilize for our production, we might not be able to fulfill demand for our products and may need to divert our engineering resources away from new product development initiatives to support the fab line transition, which would adversely affect our operating results. Our customers require our products to undergo a lengthy and expensive qualification process without any assurance of product sales Prior to purchasing our products, our customers require that our products undergo an extensive qualification process, which involves testing of the products in the customer's system as well as rigorous 20 Table of Contents reliability testing. This qualification process may continue for six months or longer. However, qualification of a product by a customer does not ensure any sales of the product to that customer. Even after successful qualification and sales of a product to a customer, a subsequent revision to the product or software, changes in the IC's manufacturing process or the selection of a new supplier by us may require a new qualification process, which may result in delays and in us holding excess or obsolete inventory. After our products are qualified, it can take an additional six months or more before the customer commences volume production of components or devices that incorporate our products. Despite these uncertainties, we devote substantial resources, including design, engineering, sales, marketing and management efforts, toward qualifying our products with customers in anticipation of sales. If we are unsuccessful or delayed in qualifying any of our products with a customer, such failure or delay would preclude or delay sales of such product to the customer, which may impede our growth and cause our business to suffer. We are a global company, which subjects us to additional business risks including logistical and financial complexity, political instability and currency fluctuations We have established international subsidiaries and have opened offices in international markets to support our activities in Asia, the Americas and Europe. This has included the establishment of a headquarters in Singapore for non-U.S. operations. The percentage of our revenues derived from outside of the United States was 85% during fiscal 2017. We may not be able to maintain or increase global market demand for our products. Our international operations are subject to a number of risks, including: <U+0095> Complexity and costs of managing international operations and related tax obligations, including our headquarters for non-U.S. operations in Singapore;    <U+0095> Protectionist laws and business practices;    <U+0095> Difficulties related to the protection of our intellectual property rights in some countries;    <U+0095> Multiple, conflicting and changing tax and other laws and regulations that may impact both our international and domestic tax and other liabilities and result in increased complexity and costs;    <U+0095> Longer sales cycles;    <U+0095> Greater difficulty in accounts receivable collection and longer collection periods;    <U+0095> High levels of distributor inventory subject to price protection and rights of return to us;    <U+0095> Political and economic instability;    <U+0095> Greater difficulty in hiring and retaining qualified personnel; and    <U+0095> The need to have business and operations systems that can meet the needs of our international business and operating structure. To date, substantially all of our sales to international customers and purchases of components from international suppliers have been denominated in U.S. dollars. As a result, an increase in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to foreign currencies could make our products more expensive for our international customers to purchase, thus rendering our products less competitive. Similarly, a decrease in the value of the U.S. dollar could reduce our buying power with respect to international suppliers. Our inability to manage growth could materially and adversely affect our business Our past growth has placed, and any future growth of our operations will continue to place, a significant strain on our management personnel, systems and resources. We anticipate that we will need to implement a variety of new and upgraded sales, operational and financial enterprise-wide systems, 21 Table of Contents information technology infrastructure, procedures and controls, including the improvement of our accounting and other internal management systems to manage this growth and maintain compliance with regulatory guidelines, including Sarbanes-Oxley Act requirements. To the extent our business grows, our internal management systems and processes will need to improve to ensure that we remain in compliance. We also expect that we will need to continue to expand, train, manage and motivate our workforce. All of these endeavors will require substantial management effort, and we anticipate that we will require additional management personnel and internal processes to manage these efforts and to plan for the succession from time to time of certain persons who have been key management and technical personnel. If we are unable to effectively manage our expanding global operations, including our international headquarters in Singapore, our business could be materially and adversely affected. Our products incorporate technology licensed from third parties We incorporate technology (including software) licensed from third parties in our products. We could be subjected to claims of infringement regardless of our lack of involvement in the development of the licensed technology. Although a third-party licensor is typically obligated to indemnify us if the licensed technology infringes on another party's intellectual property rights, such indemnification is typically limited in amount and may be worthless if the licensor becomes insolvent. See Significant litigation over intellectual property in our industry may cause us to become involved in costly and lengthy litigation which could seriously harm our business. Furthermore, any failure of third-party technology to perform properly would adversely affect sales of our products incorporating such technology. We are subject to risks relating to product concentration We derive a substantial portion of our revenues from a limited number of products, and we expect these products to continue to account for a large percentage of our revenues in the near term. Continued market acceptance of these products, is therefore, critical to our future success. In addition, substantially all of our products that we have sold include technology related to one or more of our issued U.S. patents. If these patents are found to be invalid or unenforceable, our competitors could introduce competitive products that could reduce both the volume and price per unit of our products. Our business, operating results, financial condition and cash flows could therefore be adversely affected by: <U+0095> A decline in demand for any of our more significant products;    <U+0095> Failure of our products to achieve continued market acceptance;    <U+0095> Competitive products;    <U+0095> New technological standards or changes to existing standards that we are unable to address with our products;     <U+0095> A failure to release new products or enhanced versions of our existing products on a timely basis; and     <U+0095> The failure of our new products to achieve market acceptance. We are subject to credit risks related to our accounts receivable We do not generally obtain letters of credit or other security for payment from customers, distributors or contract manufacturers. Accordingly, we are not protected against accounts receivable default or bankruptcy by these entities. Our ten largest customers or distributors represent a substantial majority of our accounts receivable. If any such customer or distributor, or a material portion of our smaller customers or distributors, were to become insolvent or otherwise not satisfy their obligations to us, we could be materially harmed. 22 Table of Contents We depend on our key personnel to manage our business effectively in a rapidly changing market, and if we are unable to retain our current personnel and hire additional personnel, our ability to develop and successfully market our products could be harmed We believe our future success will depend in large part upon our ability to attract and retain highly skilled managerial, engineering, sales and marketing personnel. We believe that our future success will be dependent on retaining the services of our key personnel, developing their successors and certain internal processes to reduce our reliance on specific individuals, and on properly managing the transition of key roles when they occur. There is currently a shortage of qualified personnel with significant experience in the design, development, manufacturing, marketing and sales of analog and mixed-signal products. In particular, there is a shortage of engineers who are familiar with the intricacies of the design and manufacturability of analog elements, and competition for such personnel is intense. Our key technical personnel represent a significant asset and serve as the primary source for our technological and product innovations. We may not be successful in attracting and retaining sufficient numbers of technical personnel to support our anticipated growth. The loss of any of our key employees or the inability to attract or retain qualified personnel both in the United States and internationally, including engineers, sales, applications and marketing personnel, could delay the development and introduction of, and negatively impact our ability to sell, our products. Any dispositions could harm our financial condition Any disposition of a product line would entail a number of risks that could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results, including: <U+0095> Diversion of management's time and attention from our core business;    <U+0095> Difficulties separating the divested business;    <U+0095> Risks to relations with customers who previously purchased products from our disposed product line;    <U+0095> Reduced leverage with suppliers due to reduced aggregate volume;    <U+0095> Risks related to employee relations;    <U+0095> Risks associated with the transfer and licensing of intellectual property;    <U+0095> Security risks and other liabilities related to the transition services provided in connection with the disposition;     <U+0095> Tax issues associated with dispositions; and    <U+0095> Disposition-related disputes, including disputes over earn-outs and escrows. Our stock price may be volatile The market price of our common stock has been volatile in the past and may be volatile in the future. The market price of our common stock may be significantly affected by the following factors: <U+0095> Actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results;    <U+0095> Changes in financial estimates by securities analysts or our failure to perform in line with such estimates;     <U+0095> Changes in market valuations of other technology companies, particularly semiconductor companies;    <U+0095> Announcements by us or our competitors of significant technical innovations, acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments; 23 Table of Contents <U+0095> Introduction of technologies or product enhancements that reduce the need for our products;    <U+0095> The loss of, or decrease in sales to, one or more key customers;    <U+0095> A large sale of stock by a significant shareholder;    <U+0095> Dilution from the issuance of our stock in connection with acquisitions;    <U+0095> The addition or removal of our stock to or from a stock index fund;    <U+0095> Departures of key personnel;    <U+0095> The required expensing of stock awards; and    <U+0095> The required changes in our reported revenue and revenue recognition accounting policy expected under Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). The stock market has experienced extreme volatility that often has been unrelated to the performance of particular companies. These market fluctuations may cause our stock price to fall regardless of our performance. Most of our current manufacturers, assemblers, test service providers, distributors and customers are concentrated in the same geographic region, which increases the risk that a natural disaster, epidemic, labor strike, war or political unrest could disrupt our operations or sales Most of our foundries and several of our assembly and test subcontractors' sites are located in Taiwan and most of our other foundry, assembly and test subcontractors are located in the Pacific Rim region. In addition, many of our customers are located in the Pacific Rim region. The risk of earthquakes in Taiwan and the Pacific Rim region is significant due to the proximity of major earthquake fault lines in the area. Earthquakes, tsunamis, fire, flooding, lack of water or other natural disasters, an epidemic, political unrest, war, labor strikes or work stoppages in countries where our semiconductor manufacturers, assemblers and test subcontractors are located, likely would result in the disruption of our foundry, assembly or test capacity. There can be no assurance that alternate capacity could be obtained on favorable terms, if at all. A natural disaster, epidemic, labor strike, war or political unrest where our customers' facilities are located would likely reduce our sales to such customers. North Korea's recent geopolitical maneuverings, including nuclear weapons and long-range missile testing, have created unrest. Such unrest could create economic uncertainty or instability, could escalate to war or otherwise adversely affect South Korea and our South Korean customers and reduce our sales to such customers, which would materially and adversely affect our operating results. In addition, a significant portion of the assembly and testing of our products occurs in South Korea. Any disruption resulting from these events could also cause significant delays in shipments of our products until we are able to shift our manufacturing, assembling or testing from the affected subcontractor to another third-party vendor. The semiconductor manufacturing process is highly complex and, from time to time, manufacturing yields may fall below our expectations, which could result in our inability to satisfy demand for our products in a timely manner and may decrease our gross margins due to higher unit costs The manufacturing of our products is a highly complex and technologically demanding process. Although we work closely with our foundries and assemblers to minimize the likelihood of reduced manufacturing yields, we have from time to time experienced lower than anticipated manufacturing yields. Changes in manufacturing processes or the inadvertent use of defective or contaminated materials could result in lower than anticipated manufacturing yields or unacceptable performance deficiencies, which could lower our gross margins. If our foundries fail to deliver fabricated silicon 24 Table of Contents wafers of satisfactory quality in a timely manner, we will be unable to meet our customers' demand for our products in a timely manner, which would adversely affect our operating results and damage our customer relationships. We depend on our customers to support our products, and some of our customers offer competing products We rely on our customers to provide hardware, software, intellectual property indemnification and other technical support for the products supplied by our customers. If our customers do not provide the required functionality or if our customers do not provide satisfactory support for their products, the demand for these devices that incorporate our products may diminish or we may otherwise be materially adversely affected. Any reduction in the demand for these devices would significantly reduce our revenues. In certain products, some of our customers offer their own competitive products. These customers may find it advantageous to support their own offerings in the marketplace in lieu of promoting our products. Our convertible senior notes could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition Upon conversion, our convertible senior notes may be settled in cash, shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares, at our election. We intend to settle the principal amount of the notes in cash. If we do not have adequate cash available, we may not be able to settle the principal amount in cash. In such case, we will be required to settle the principal amount in stock, which would result in immediate, and likely material, dilution to the ownership interests of our existing stockholders. Any sales in the public market of our common stock issuable upon such conversion could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock. Following any conclusion that we no longer have the ability to settle the convertible senior notes in cash, we will be required on a going forward basis to change our accounting policy for earnings per share from the treasury stock method to the if-converted method. Earnings per share may be lower under the if-converted method as compared to the treasury stock method. The principal balance of the convertible senior notes was separated into liability and equity components, which were recorded initially at fair value. The excess of the principal amount of the liability component over its carrying amount represents the debt discount, which is accreted to interest expense over the term of the notes using the effective interest method. Accordingly, we will report higher interest expense because of the recognition of both the debt discount amortization and the notes' coupon interest. Our debt could adversely affect our operations and financial condition We believe we have the ability to service our debt, but our ability to make the required payments thereunder when due depends upon our future performance, which will be subject to general economic conditions, industry cycles and other factors affecting our operations, including risk factors described herein, many of which are beyond our control. Our credit facility also contains covenants, including financial covenants. If we breach any of the covenants under our credit facility and do not obtain appropriate waivers, then, subject to any applicable cure periods, our outstanding indebtedness thereunder could be declared immediately due and payable. We could seek to raise additional debt or equity capital in the future, but additional capital may not be available on terms acceptable to us, or at all We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents, investments and credit under our credit facility will be sufficient to meet our working capital needs, capital expenditures, investment requirements and 25 Table of Contents commitments for at least the next 12 months. However, our ability to borrow further under the credit facility is dependent upon our ability to satisfy various conditions, covenants and representations. It is possible that we may need to raise additional funds to finance our activities or to facilitate acquisitions of other businesses, products, intellectual property or technologies. We believe we could raise these funds, if needed, by selling equity or debt securities to the public or to selected investors. In addition, even though we may not need additional funds, we may still elect to sell additional equity or debt securities or obtain credit facilities for other reasons. However, we may not be able to obtain additional funds on favorable terms, or at all. If we decide to raise additional funds by issuing equity or convertible debt securities, the ownership percentages of existing shareholders would be reduced. We have limited resources compared to some of our current and potential competitors and we may not be able to compete effectively and increase market share Some of our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories, significantly greater resources and name recognition and a larger base of customers than we have. As a result, these competitors may have greater credibility with our existing and potential customers. They also may be able to adopt more aggressive pricing policies and devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of their products than we can to ours. In addition, some of our current and potential competitors have already established supplier or joint development relationships with the decision makers at our current or potential customers. These competitors may be able to leverage their existing relationships to discourage their customers from purchasing products from us or persuade them to replace our products with their products. Our competitors may also offer bundled solutions offering a more complete product despite the technical merits or advantages of our products. These competitors may elect not to support our products which could complicate our sales efforts. These and other competitive pressures may prevent us from competing successfully against current or future competitors, and may materially harm our business. Competition could decrease our prices, reduce our sales, lower our gross margins and/or decrease our market share. Provisions in our charter documents and Delaware law could prevent, delay or impede a change in control of us and may reduce the market price of our common stock Provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could have the effect of discouraging, delaying or preventing a merger or acquisition that a stockholder may consider favorable. For example, our certificate of incorporation and bylaws provide for: <U+0095> The division of our Board of Directors into three classes to be elected on a staggered basis, one class each year;     <U+0095> The ability of our Board of Directors to issue shares of our preferred stock in one or more series without further authorization of our stockholders;    <U+0095> A prohibition on stockholder action by written consent;    <U+0095> Elimination of the right of stockholders to call a special meeting of stockholders;    <U+0095> A requirement that stockholders provide advance notice of any stockholder nominations of directors or any proposal of new business to be considered at any meeting of stockholders; and    <U+0095> A requirement that a supermajority vote be obtained to amend or repeal certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation. We also are subject to the anti-takeover laws of Delaware which may discourage, delay or prevent someone from acquiring or merging with us, which may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. 26 Table of Contents Risks related to our industry We are subject to the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry, which has been subject to significant fluctuations The semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and is characterized by constant and rapid technological change, rapid product obsolescence and price erosion, evolving standards, short product life cycles and wide fluctuations in product supply and demand. The industry has experienced significant fluctuations, often connected with, or in anticipation of, maturing product cycles and new product introductions of both semiconductor companies' and their customers' products and fluctuations in general economic conditions. Deteriorating general worldwide economic conditions, including reduced economic activity, concerns about credit and inflation, increased energy costs, decreased consumer confidence, reduced corporate profits, decreased spending and similar adverse business conditions, would make it very difficult for our customers, our vendors, and us to accurately forecast and plan future business activities and could cause U.S. and foreign businesses to slow spending on our products. We cannot predict the timing, strength, or duration of any economic slowdown or economic recovery. If the economy or markets in which we operate deteriorate, our business, financial condition, and results of operations would likely be materially and adversely affected. Downturns have been characterized by diminished product demand, production overcapacity, high inventory levels and accelerated erosion of average selling prices. In the recent past, we believe the semiconductor industry suffered a downturn due in large part to adverse conditions in the global credit and financial markets, including diminished liquidity and credit availability, declines in consumer confidence, declines in economic growth, increased unemployment rates and general uncertainty regarding the economy. Such downturns may have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results. Upturns have been characterized by increased product demand and production capacity constraints created by increased competition for access to third-party foundry, assembly and test capacity. We are dependent on the availability of such capacity to manufacture, assemble and test our products. None of our third-party foundry, assembly or test subcontractors have provided assurances that adequate capacity will be available to us. The average selling prices of our products could decrease rapidly which may negatively impact our revenues and gross margins We may experience substantial period-to-period fluctuations in future operating results due to the erosion of our average selling prices. We have reduced the average unit price of our products in anticipation of or in response to competitive pricing pressures, new product introductions by us or our competitors and other factors. If we are unable to offset any such reductions in our average selling prices by increasing our sales volumes, increasing our sales content per application or reducing production costs, our gross margins and revenues will suffer. To maintain our gross margin percentage, we will need to develop and introduce new products and product enhancements on a timely basis and continually reduce our costs. Our failure to do so could cause our revenues and gross margin percentage to decline. Competition within the numerous markets we target may reduce sales of our products and reduce our market share The markets for semiconductors in general, and for mixed-signal products in particular, are intensely competitive. We expect that the market for our products will continually evolve and will be subject to rapid technological change. In addition, as we target and supply products to numerous markets and applications, we face competition from a relatively large number of competitors. We compete with Analog Devices, Broadcom, Cypress, IDT, Infineon, Maxim Integrated Products, 27 Table of Contents MaxLinear, Microchip, Microsemi, Nordic Semiconductor, NXP Semiconductors, Qualcomm, Renesas, STMicroelectronics, Synaptics, Texas Instruments and others. We expect to face competition in the future from our current competitors, other manufacturers and designers of semiconductors, and start-up semiconductor design companies. As the markets for communications products grow, we also may face competition from traditional communications device companies. These companies may enter the mixed-signal semiconductor market by introducing their own products or by entering into strategic relationships with or acquiring other existing providers of semiconductor products. In addition, large companies may restructure their operations to create separate companies or may acquire new businesses that are focused on providing the types of products we produce or acquire our customers. We may be the victim of business disruptions and security breaches, including cyber-attacks, which could lead to liability or could damage our reputation and financial results Information technology system and/or network disruptions, regardless of the cause, but including acts of sabotage, error, or other actions, could harm the company's operations. Failure to effectively prevent, detect, and recover from security breaches, including cyber-attacks, could result in the misuse of company assets, disruption to the company, diversion of management resources, regulatory inquiries, legal claims or proceedings, reputational damage, loss of sales and other costs to the company. We routinely face attacks that attempt to breach our security protocols, gain access to or disrupt our computerized systems or steal proprietary company, customer, partner or employee information. These attacks are sometimes successful. These attacks may be due to security breaches, employee error, theft, malfeasance, phishing schemes, ransomware, faulty password or data security management, or other irregularities. The theft, loss, destruction, unavailability or misuse of personal or business data collected, used, stored or transferred by us to run our business could result in increased security costs or costs related to defending legal claims. Industrial espionage, theft or loss of our intellectual property data could lead to counterfeit products or harm the competitive position of our products and services. Costs to implement, test and maintain measures to promote compliance with applicable privacy and data security laws as well as to protect the overall security of our system could be significant. Attempted or successful attacks against our products and services could damage our reputation with customers or users and reduce demand for our products and services. Changes in the Privacy and Data Security/Protection Laws Could Have an Adverse Effect on our Operations Federal, state and international privacy-related or data protection laws and regulations could have an adverse effect on our operations. Complying with these laws and the possibility of proceedings against us by governmental entities or others in relation to these laws could increase operational costs. In May 2018, the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (""GDPR"") goes into effect, replacing the EU's 1995 Data Protection Directive. The costs of compliance with the GDPR and the potential for fines and penalties in the event of a breach of the GDPR may have an adverse effect on our operations. We may be subject to information technology failures that could damage our reputation, business operations and financial condition We rely on information technology for the effective operation of our business. Our systems are subject to damage or interruption from a number of potential sources, including natural disasters, accidents, power disruptions, telecommunications failures, acts of terrorism or war, computer viruses, theft, physical or electronic break-ins, cyber-attacks, sabotage, vandalism, or similar events or disruptions. Our security measures may not detect or prevent such security breaches. Any such compromise of our information security could result in the theft or unauthorized publication or use of our confidential business or proprietary information, result in the unauthorized release of customer, supplier or employee data, result in a violation of privacy or other laws, expose us to a risk of litigation 28 Table of Contents or damage our reputation. In addition, our inability to use or access information systems at critical points in time could unfavorably impact the timely and efficient operation of our business, which could negatively affect our business and operating results. Third parties with which we conduct business, such as foundries, assembly and test contractors, distributors and customers, have access to certain portions of our sensitive data. In the event that these third parties do not properly safeguard our data that they hold, security breaches could result and negatively impact our reputation, business operations and financial results. Our products must conform to industry standards and technology in order to be accepted by end users in our markets Generally, our products comprise only a part of a device. All components of such devices must uniformly comply with industry standards in order to operate efficiently together. We depend on companies that provide other components of the devices to support prevailing industry standards. Many of these companies are significantly larger and more influential in affecting industry standards than we are. Some industry standards may not be widely adopted or implemented uniformly, and competing standards may emerge that may be preferred by our customers or end users. If larger companies do not support the same industry standards that we do, or if competing standards emerge, market acceptance of our products could be adversely affected which would harm our business. Products for certain applications are based on industry standards that are continually evolving. Our ability to compete in the future will depend on our ability to identify and ensure compliance with these evolving industry standards. The emergence of new industry standards could render our products incompatible with products developed by other suppliers. As a result, we could be required to invest significant time and effort and to incur significant expense to redesign our products to ensure compliance with relevant standards. If our products are not in compliance with prevailing industry standards for a significant period of time, we could miss opportunities to achieve crucial design wins. Our pursuit of necessary technological advances may require substantial time and expense. We may not be successful in developing or using new technologies or in developing new products or product enhancements that achieve market acceptance. If our products fail to achieve market acceptance, our growth prospects, operating results and competitive position could be adversely affected. Customer demands and new regulations related to conflict-free minerals may adversely affect us The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act imposes new disclosure requirements regarding the use of ""conflict"" minerals mined from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries in products, whether or not these products are manufactured by third parties. These new requirements could affect the pricing, sourcing and availability of minerals used in the manufacture of semiconductor devices (including our products). There will be additional costs associated with complying with the disclosure requirements, such as costs related to determining the source of any conflict minerals used in our products. Our supply chain is complex and we may be unable to verify the origins for all metals used in our products. We may also encounter challenges with our customers and stockholders if we are unable to certify that our products are conflict free.","Item 7.    Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this report. This discussion contains forward-looking statements. Please see the ""Cautionary Statement"" and ""Risk Factors"" above for discussions of the uncertainties, risks and assumptions associated with these statements. Our fiscal year-end financial reporting periods are a 52-or 53-week fiscal year that ends on the Saturday closest to December 31. Fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015 were 52-week years and ended on December 30, 2017, December 31, 2016 and January 2, 2016, respectively. Overview We are a leading provider of silicon, software and solutions for a smarter, more connected world. Our award-winning technologies are shaping the future of the Internet of Things (IoT), Internet infrastructure, industrial automation, consumer and automotive markets. Our world-class engineering team creates products focused on performance, energy savings, connectivity and simplicity. Our primary semiconductor products are mixed-signal integrated circuits (ICs), which are electronic components that convert real-world analog signals, such as sound and radio waves, into digital signals that electronic products can process. As a fabless semiconductor company, we rely on third-party semiconductor fabricators in Asia, and to a lesser extent the United States and Europe, to manufacture the silicon wafers that reflect our IC designs. Each wafer contains numerous die, which are cut from the wafer to create a chip for an IC. We rely on third parties in Asia to assemble, package, and, in most cases, test these devices and ship these units to our customers. Testing performed by such third parties facilitates faster delivery of products to our customers (particularly those located in Asia), shorter production cycle times, lower inventory requirements, lower costs and increased flexibility of test capacity. Our expertise in analog-intensive, high-performance, mixed-signal ICs and software enables us to develop highly differentiated solutions that address multiple markets. We group our products into the following categories: <U+0095> Internet of Things products, which include our microcontroller (MCU), wireless and sensor products;    <U+0095> Broadcast products, which include our broadcast consumer and automotive products;    <U+0095> Infrastructure products, which include our timing products (clocks and oscillators), and isolation devices; and     <U+0095> Access products, which include our Voice over IP (VoIP) products, embedded modems and Power over Ethernet (PoE) devices. Current Period Highlights Revenues increased $71.2 million in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016, primarily due to increased revenues from our IoT and Infrastructure products offset by decreased revenues from our Access and Broadcast products. Gross margin increased $32.7 million during the same period due primarily to increased product sales. Gross margin as a percent of revenues decreased to 59.1% in fiscal 2017 compared to 60.4% in fiscal 2016 primarily due to variations in product mix. Operating expenses increased $14.0 million in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 due primarily to increased personnel-related expenses, offset by decreased new product introduction costs and legal fees. We ended fiscal 2017 with $764.0 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. Net cash provided by operating activities was $189.5 million during fiscal 2017. Accounts receivable was 34 Table of Contents $71.4 million at December 30, 2017, representing 32 days sales outstanding (DSO). Inventory was $73.1 million at December 30, 2017, representing 81 days of inventory (DOI). In fiscal 2017, we completed a private offering of $400 million principal amount convertible senior notes, and used $72.5 million of the proceeds to pay off the remaining balance of our Amended Credit Agreement. Through acquisitions and internal development efforts, we have continued to diversify our product portfolio and introduce new products and solutions with added functionality and further integration. On January 20, 2017, we acquired Zentri, Inc., an innovator in low-power, cloud-connected Wi-Fi technologies for the IoT. On December 7, 2017, we entered into an agreement to either acquire Sigma Designs, Inc. or its Z-Wave business. On January 23, 2018, Sigma Designs announced that due to the closing conditions for the acquisition of the entirety of Sigma Designs not being satisfied, the parties would move forward with the sale of the Z-Wave business to us in an asset sale, subject to approval by Sigma Designs' shareholders. Sigma Designs is a provider of solutions for the connected home including Z-Wave, an IoT technology for smart home solutions. See Note 8, Acquisitions, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. In fiscal 2017, we introduced I2C-programmable crystal oscillators (XOs) delivering excellent jitter performance and frequency flexibility for 100/200/400G applications; optical biometric sensors providing advanced heart rate monitoring (HRM) along with electrocardiogram (ECG) capabilities for a wide range of wearable fitness and wellness products; new dynamic multiprotocol software for our Wireless Gecko system-on-chip (SoC) and module portfolio, enabling simultaneous operation of Zigbee and Bluetooth low energy (LE) on a single SoC; a comprehensive reference design to simplify the development of USB Type-C<U+0099> rechargeable lithium ion battery packs; high-performance, multi-channel jitter attenuating wireless clocks supporting 4G/LTE and Ethernet; high-performance clock generators offering a highly integrated timing solution for 10/25/100G applications; power-efficient Hall-effect magnetic sensors offering flexible I2C configuration and built-in tamper detection and temperature sensing; a scalable, flexible and cost-effective car radio solution for the global automotive infotainment market; new EFM32 Giant Gecko MCUs offering advanced capabilities and large memory options scaling up to 2 MB flash and 512 KB RAM; a wireless software stack, development tools and a mobile app supporting the new Bluetooth mesh specification; the Ultra Series<U+0099> family of crystal oscillators (XOs) delivering ultra-low jitter performance; EFR32xG13 Wireless Gecko SoCs supporting full Bluetooth 5 connectivity and more memory options; a USB-to-I2S bridge chip that provides a simple, turnkey solution for transferring digital audio data; new EFR32 Wireless Gecko SoCs supporting a broad range of multiprotocol, multiband use cases; EFM32 Gecko MCUs offering new security features, large memory options, higher peripheral integration and ultra-low power consumption; and an enhanced Micrium® real-time operating system (RTOS) and new Platform Builder software to accelerate embedded design. We plan to continue to introduce products that increase the content we provide for existing applications, thereby enabling us to serve markets we do not currently address and expand our total available market opportunity. During fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, we had no end customer that represented more than 10% of our revenues. In addition to direct sales to customers, some of our end customers purchase products indirectly from us through distributors and contract manufacturers. An end customer purchasing through a contract manufacturer typically instructs such contract manufacturer to obtain our products and incorporate such products with other components for sale by such contract manufacturer to the end customer. Although we actually sell the products to, and are paid by, the distributors and contract manufacturers, we refer to such end customer as our customer. Three of our distributors who sell to our customers, Edom Technology, Avnet and Arrow Electronics, each represented 19%, 14% and 12% of our revenues during fiscal 2017, and 17%, 13% and 11% of our revenues during fiscal 2016, respectively. Edom and Avnet represented 20% and 12% of our revenues during fiscal 2015, respectively. There were no contract manufacturers that accounted for more than 10% of our revenues in fiscal 2017, 2016 or 2015. 35 Table of Contents The percentage of our revenues derived from outside of the United States was 85% in fiscal 2017, 86% in fiscal 2016 and 85% in fiscal 2015. All of our revenues to date have been denominated in U.S. dollars. We believe that a majority of our revenues will continue to be derived from customers outside of the United States. The sales cycle for our ICs can be as long as 12 months or more. An additional three to six months or more are usually required before a customer ships a significant volume of devices that incorporate our ICs. Due to this lengthy sales cycle, we typically experience a significant delay between incurring research and development and selling, general and administrative expenses, and the corresponding sales. Consequently, if sales in any quarter do not occur when expected, expenses and inventory levels could be disproportionately high, and our operating results for that quarter and, potentially, future quarters would be adversely affected. Moreover, the amount of time between initial research and development and commercialization of a product, if ever, can be substantially longer than the sales cycle for the product. Accordingly, if we incur substantial research and development costs without developing a commercially successful product, our operating results, as well as our growth prospects, could be adversely affected. Because many of our ICs are designed for use in consumer products such as televisions, set-top boxes, radios and wearables, we expect that the demand for our products will be typically subject to some degree of seasonal demand. However, rapid changes in our markets and across our product areas make it difficult for us to accurately estimate the impact of seasonal factors on our business. Results of Operations The following describes the line items set forth in our Consolidated Statements of Income: Revenues.    Revenues are generated predominately by sales of our products. A small portion of our revenues is derived from the sale of patents. Our revenues are subject to variation from period to period due to the volume of shipments made within a period, the mix of products we sell and the prices we charge for our products. Cost of Revenues.    Cost of revenues includes the cost of purchasing finished silicon wafers processed by independent foundries; costs associated with assembly, test and shipping of those products; costs of personnel and equipment associated with manufacturing support, logistics and quality assurance; costs of software royalties, other intellectual property license costs and certain acquired intangible assets; and an allocated portion of our occupancy costs. Our gross margin as a percentage of revenue fluctuates depending on product mix, manufacturing yields, inventory valuation adjustments, average selling prices and other factors. Research and Development.    Research and development expense consists primarily of personnel-related expenses, including stock-based compensation, as well as new product masks, external consulting and services costs, equipment tooling, equipment depreciation, amortization of intangible assets, and an allocated portion of our occupancy costs. Research and development activities include the design of new products, refinement of existing products and design of test methodologies to ensure compliance with required specifications. Selling, General and Administrative.    Selling, general and administrative expense consists primarily of personnel-related expenses, including stock-based compensation, as well as an allocated portion of our occupancy costs, sales commissions to independent sales representatives, applications engineering support, professional fees, legal fees and promotional and marketing expenses. Interest Income and Other, Net.    Interest income and other, net reflects interest earned on our cash, cash equivalents and investment balances, foreign currency remeasurement adjustments and other non-operating income and expenses. 36 Table of Contents Interest Expense.    Interest expense consists of interest on our short and long-term obligations, including our convertible senior notes and credit facility. Interest expense on our convertible senior notes includes contractual interest, amortization of the debt discount and amortization of debt issuance costs. Provision for Income Taxes.    Provision for income taxes includes both domestic and foreign income taxes at the applicable tax rates adjusted for non-deductible expenses, research and development tax credits and other permanent differences. The following table sets forth our Consolidated Statements of Income data as a percentage of revenues for the periods indicated: Fiscal Year         2017    2016    2015     Revenues     100.0 %   100.0 %   100.0 %  Cost of revenues     40.9     39.6     40.9                                                                                   Gross margin     59.1     60.4     59.1    Operating expenses:                      Research and development     27.2     28.6     29.2    Selling, general and administrative     20.8     22.3     24.9                                                                                   Operating expenses     48.0     50.9     54.1                                                                                   Operating income     11.1     9.5     5.0    Other income (expense):                      Interest income and other, net     0.8     0.1     0.1    Interest expense     (1.9 )   (0.4 )   (0.4 )                                                                                 Income before income taxes     10.0     9.2     4.7    Provision for income taxes     3.9     0.4     0.1                                                                                   Net income     6.1 %   8.8 %   4.6 % Comparison of Fiscal 2017 to Fiscal 2016 Revenues Fiscal Year              (in millions)        2017    2016    Change    % Change     Internet of Things     $ 395.0     $ 314.6     $ 80.4     25.6 %  Broadcast     153.0     157.7     (4.7 )    (3.0 )%  Infrastructure     152.2     147.7     4.5     3.0 %  Access     68.7     77.6     (8.9 )    (11.4 )%                                                                                                     Total     $ 768.9     $ 697.6      $ 71.3     10.2 % The change in revenues in fiscal 2017 was due primarily to: <U+0095> Increased revenues of $80.4 million for our IoT products, due primarily to increased demand for our wireless products.     <U+0095> Decreased revenues of $4.7 million for Broadcast products, due primarily to decreases in the market for our consumer products offset by increased demand for our automotive products. 37 Table of Contents <U+0095> Increased revenues of $4.5 million for our Infrastructure products, due primarily to increased demand for our isolation products offset by decreased demand for our timing products and decreased patent sale revenue of $5.0 million in fiscal 2016 with no patents sales in fiscal 2017.    <U+0095> Decreased revenues of $8.9 million for our Access products, due primarily to decreased demand for our VoIP products and decreases in the market for such products. Unit volumes of our products increased by 21.0% and average selling prices decreased by 8.5% compared to fiscal 2016. The average selling prices of our products may fluctuate significantly from period to period due to changes in product mix and other factors. In general, as our products become more mature, we expect to experience decreases in average selling prices. We anticipate that newly announced, higher priced, next generation products and product derivatives will offset some of these decreases. Gross Margin Fiscal Year         (in millions)        2017    2016    Change     Gross margin     $ 454.2     $ 421.5     $ 32.7    Percent of revenue     59.1 %   60.4 %    (1.3 )% The increased dollar amount of gross margin in fiscal 2017 was due to increases in gross margin of $45.0 million for our IoT products and $1.4 million for our Infrastructure products, offset by decreases in gross margin of $7.0 million for our Broadcast products and $6.7 million for our Access products. Gross margin increased in fiscal 2017 due primarily to increased product sales. Gross margin as a percent of revenues decreased in fiscal 2017 primarily due to variations in product mix. Gross margin in fiscal 2016 included $5.0 million from the sale of patents, which had no associated cost of revenues. We may experience declines in the average selling prices of certain of our products. This creates downward pressure on gross margin as a percentage of revenues and may be offset to the extent we are able to: 1) introduce higher margin new products and gain market share with our products; 2) reduce costs of existing products through improved design; 3) achieve lower production costs from our wafer suppliers and third-party assembly and test subcontractors; 4) achieve lower production costs per unit as a result of improved yields throughout the manufacturing process; or 5) reduce logistics costs. Research and Development Fiscal Year              (in millions)        2017    2016    Change    % Change     Research and development     $ 209.5     $ 199.7     $ 9.8     4.9 %  Percent of revenue     27.2 %   28.6 % The increase in research and development expense in fiscal 2017 was primarily due to increases of $12.6 million for personnel-related expenses, including costs associated with increased headcount and acquisitions. The increase in research and development expense in fiscal 2017 was offset in part by a decrease of $2.3 million for new product introduction costs. The decrease in research and development expense as a percent of revenues in fiscal 2017 was due to our increased revenues. We expect that research and development expense will increase in absolute dollars in the first quarter of 2018. 38 Table of Contents Selling, General and Administrative Fiscal Year              (in millions)        2017    2016    Change    % Change     Selling, general and administrative     $ 159.7     $ 155.5     $ 4.2     2.7 %  Percent of revenue     20.8 %   22.3 % The increase in selling, general and administrative expense in fiscal 2017 was primarily due to an increase of $6.1 million for personnel-related expenses, including costs associated with increased headcount and acquisitions. The increase in selling, general and administrative in fiscal 2017 was offset in part by a decrease of $1.4 million for legal fees, primarily related to litigation. The decrease in selling, general and administrative expense as a percent of revenues in fiscal 2017 was due to our increased revenues. We expect that selling, general and administrative expense will increase in absolute dollars in the first quarter of 2018. Interest Income and Other, Net Interest income and other, net in fiscal 2017 was $6.1 million compared to $0.8 million in fiscal 2016. The increase in interest income and other, net in fiscal 2017 was primarily due to increased interest income earned as a result of higher market interest rates and higher cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments balances. Interest Expense Interest expense in fiscal 2017 was $14.1 million compared to $2.6 million in fiscal 2016. The increase in interest expense in fiscal 2017 was primarily due to increased interest expense of $14.6 million on our convertible debt, including amortization of the debt discount and debt issuance costs. The increase in interest expense was offset in part by a $2.0 million gain recorded in connection with the termination of our interest rate swap agreement. Provision for Income Taxes Fiscal Year         (in millions)        2017    2016    Change     Provision for income taxes     $ 29.8     $ 3.0     $ 26.8    Effective tax rate     38.8 %   4.7 % On December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the ""Tax Act""). The effective tax rate for fiscal 2017 increased from fiscal 2016 primarily due to the impacts from the Tax Act including a one-time transition tax of $54.4 million on unrepatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries as well as tax expense of $21.8 million related to the revaluation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities due to the reduction of the U.S. corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% under the Tax Act. These increases in tax expense were partially offset by the release of a deferred tax liability related to future foreign earnings expected under our intercompany cost-sharing arrangement of $39.4 million, as well as a decrease in the valuation allowance established on federal research and development tax credits of $10.5 million. The effective tax rates for each of the periods presented differ from the U.S. federal statutory tax rate of 35% due to the amount of income earned in foreign jurisdictions where the tax rate may be lower than the federal statutory rate, and other permanent items including research and development tax credits and nondeductible compensation expenses. In addition, the effective tax rate for fiscal 2017 was also impacted by certain one-time effects as a result of the enactment of U.S. tax reform. 39 Table of Contents We are still evaluating the impact of the Tax Act on our future U.S. tax liability, but at this time, we expect that the overall impact of the Tax Act on our effective tax rate will be an increase over more normalized levels from 2016. This increase is expected due to certain new provisions included in the Tax Act. See Note 16, Income Taxes, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

Gross margin in fiscal 2016 included $5.0 million from the sale of patents, which had no associated cost of revenues. Gross margin in fiscal 2015 included $2.6 million in acquisition-related charges for the fair value write-up associated with inventory acquired from Bluegiga and Telegesis. 40 Table of Contents Research and Development Fiscal Year                        %  Change    (in millions)        2016    2015    Change     Research and development     $ 199.7     $ 188.1     $ 11.6     6.2 %  Percent of revenue     28.6 %   29.2 % The increase in research and development expense in fiscal 2016 was primarily due to increases of $5.9 million for personnel-related expenses, including costs associated with increased headcount, and $4.4 million for new product introduction costs.

The increase in the effective tax rate was partially offset by a reduction in the prior period valuation allowance. See Note 16, Income Taxes, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. The effective tax rates for each of the periods presented differ from the federal statutory rate of 35% due to the amount of income earned in foreign jurisdictions where the tax rate may be lower than the federal statutory rate and other permanent items including nondeductible compensation expenses and research and development tax credits. 41 Table of Contents Business Outlook The following represents our business outlook for the first quarter of fiscal 2018. Income Statement Item        Estimate   Revenues   $196 million to $202 million  Gross margin    59.0%  Operating expenses    $98.0 million  Effective tax rate    (15.0)%  Diluted earnings per share    $0.42 to $0.48 Liquidity and Capital Resources Our principal sources of liquidity as of December 30, 2017 consisted of $764.0 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, of which approximately $587.3 million was held by our U.S. entities. The remaining balance was held by our foreign subsidiaries. Our cash equivalents and short-term investments consisted of government debt securities, which include agency bonds, municipal bonds, U.S. government bonds, international government bonds, international agency commercial paper and variable-rate demand notes; corporate debt securities, which include asset-backed securities, corporate bonds, commercial paper and certificates of deposit; and money market funds. Our long-term investments consisted of auction-rate securities. As of December 30, 2017, we held $6.0 million par value auction-rate securities, all of which have experienced failed auctions because sell orders exceeded buy orders. See Note 4, Fair Value of Financial Instruments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities was $189.5 million during fiscal 2017, compared to net cash provided of $128.9 million during fiscal 2016. Operating cash flows during fiscal 2017 reflect our net income of $47.1 million, adjustments of $70.4 million for depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation and deferred income taxes, and a net cash inflow of $72.0 million due to changes in our operating assets and liabilities. Net cash provided by operating activities was $128.9 million during fiscal 2016, compared to net cash provided of $105.4 million during fiscal 2015. Operating cash flows during fiscal 2016 reflect our net income of $61.5 million, adjustments of $74.8 million for depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation and deferred income taxes, and a net cash outflow of $7.4 million due to changes in our operating assets and liabilities. Accounts receivable decreased to $71.4 million at December 30, 2017 from $74.4 million at December 31, 2016. The decrease in accounts receivable resulted primarily from normal variations in the timing of collections and billings. Our average DSO was 32 days at December 30, 2017 and 37 days at December 31, 2016. Inventory increased to $73.1 million at December 30, 2017 from $59.6 million at December 31, 2016. Our inventory level is primarily impacted by our need to make purchase commitments to support forecasted demand and variations between forecasted and actual demand. Our DOI was 81 days at December 30, 2017 and 73 days at December 31, 2016. 42 Table of Contents Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities was $374.3 million during fiscal 2017, compared to net cash used of $49.6 million during fiscal 2016. The increase in cash outflows was principally due to an increase of $318.6 million in net purchases of marketable securities and an increase of $8.6 million in net payments for the acquisition of businesses. On December 7, 2017, we entered into an agreement to acquire Sigma Designs or its Z-Wave business. See Note 8,  Acquisitions, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Net cash used in investing activities was $49.6 million during fiscal 2016, compared to net cash used of $49.3 million during fiscal 2015. The increase in cash outflows was principally due to an increase of $87.8 million in net purchases of marketable securities and an increase of $2.4 million for the purchase of other assets, offset by a decrease of $89.6 million in net payments for the acquisition of businesses. We anticipate capital expenditures of approximately $28 to $32 million for fiscal 2018. Additionally, as part of our growth strategy, we expect to evaluate opportunities to invest in or acquire other businesses, intellectual property or technologies that would complement or expand our current offerings, expand the breadth of our markets or enhance our technical capabilities. Financing Activities Net cash provided by financing activities was $313.0 million during fiscal 2017, compared to net cash used of $52.3 million during fiscal 2016. The increase in cash inflows was principally due to $389.5 million in net proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt and a decrease of $40.5 million for repurchases of our common stock, offset by an increase of $67.5 million in payments on debt. See Note 10, Debt, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. In October 2017, the Board of Directors authorized a program to repurchase up to $100 million of our common stock from January 2018 through December 2018. Net cash used in financing activities was $52.3 million during fiscal 2016, compared to net cash used of $83.8 million during fiscal 2015. The decrease in cash outflows was principally due to a decrease of $89.7 million in payments on debt and a decrease of $30.9 million for repurchases of our common stock, offset by $81.2 million in net proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt during fiscal 2015 and an increase of $5.0 million for payments of acquisition-related contingent consideration. Our debt facilities include $400 million principal amount convertible senior notes (the ""Notes"") and a $300 million revolving credit facility. On March 6, 2017, we completed a private offering of the Notes. The Notes bear interest semi-annually at a rate of 1.375% per year and will mature on March 1, 2022, unless repurchased, redeemed or converted at an earlier date. In connection with our offering of the Notes, we entered into a second amendment to our prior credit agreement and paid off the remaining balance of $72.5 million. We have an option to increase the size of the borrowing capacity of the revolving credit facility by up to an aggregate of $200 million in additional commitments, subject to certain conditions. See Note 10, Debt, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including the rate of sales growth, market acceptance of our products, the timing and extent of research and development projects, potential acquisitions of companies or technologies and the expansion of our sales and marketing activities. We believe our existing cash, cash equivalents, investments and credit under our Credit Facility are sufficient to meet our capital requirements through at least the next 12 months, although we could be required, or could elect, to seek additional funding prior to that time. We may enter into acquisitions or strategic arrangements in the future which also could require us to seek additional equity or debt financing. 43 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of December 30, 2017 (in thousands): Payments due by period         Total    2018    2019    2020    2021    2022    Thereafter     Long-term debt obligations (1)     $ 400,000     $  -      $  -      $  -      $  -      $ 400,000     $  -     Interest on long-term debt obligations (2)     $ 27,075     $ 6,400     $ 6,400     $ 6,025     $ 5,500     $ 2,750     $  -     Operating lease obligations (3)     $ 24,860     $ 5,807     $ 4,278     $ 3,539     $ 3,016     $ 2,804     $ 5,416    Purchase obligations (4)     $ 51,707     $ 51,707     $  -      $  -      $  -      $  -      $  -     Other long-term obligations (5)     $ 53,001     $  -      $ 12,017     $ 8,181     $ 3,408     $ 3,831     $ 25,564 (1)Long-term debt obligations represent the principal portion of our convertible senior notes (the ""Notes""). The Notes mature on March 1, 2022, unless repurchased, redeemed or converted at an earlier date.   (2)Interest on our long-term debt obligations primarily represents contractual interest on the Notes, which bear interest semi-annually at a rate of 1.375% per year. Interest excludes non-cash amortization of the debt discount and debt issuance costs.   (3)Operating lease obligations include amounts for leased facilities.   (4)Purchase obligations include contractual arrangements in the form of purchase orders with suppliers where there is a fixed non-cancelable payment schedule or minimum payments due with a reduced delivery schedule.   (5)Other long-term obligations primarily represent non-current income taxes and software license obligations.      We are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate as to when or if cash settlement with taxing authorities will occur for our unrecognized tax benefits. Therefore, our liability of $3.2 million for unrecognized tax benefits is not included in the table above. See Note 16, Income Taxes, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements As of December 30, 2017, we had no significant off-balance sheet arrangements. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of financial statements and accompanying notes in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported. Changes in facts and circumstances could have a significant impact on the resulting estimated amounts included in the financial statements. We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more complex judgments and estimates. We also have other policies that we consider to be key accounting policies, such as our policies for revenue recognition, including the deferral of revenues and cost of revenues on sales to distributors; however, these policies do not meet the definition of critical accounting estimates because they do not generally require us to make estimates or judgments that are difficult or subjective. Inventory valuation - We assess the recoverability of inventories through the application of a set of methods, assumptions and estimates. In determining net realizable value, we write down inventory that may be slow moving or have some form of obsolescence, including inventory that has aged more than 44 Table of Contents 12 months. We also adjust the valuation of inventory when its manufacturing cost exceeds the estimated selling price less costs of completion, disposal and transportation. We assess the potential for any unusual customer returns based on known quality or business issues and write-off inventory losses for scrap or non-saleable material. Inventory not otherwise identified to be written down is compared to an assessment of our 12-month forecasted demand. The result of this methodology is compared against the product life cycle and competitive situations in the marketplace to determine the appropriateness of the resulting inventory levels. Demand for our products may fluctuate significantly over time, and actual demand and market conditions may be more or less favorable than those that we project. In the event that actual demand is lower or market conditions are worse than originally projected, additional inventory write-downs may be required. Stock-based compensation - We recognize the fair-value of stock-based compensation transactions in the Consolidated Statements of Income. The fair value of our full-value stock awards (with the exception of market-based performance awards) equals the fair market value of our stock on the date of grant. The fair value of our market-based performance awards is estimated at the date of grant using a Monte-Carlo simulation. The fair value of our stock option and employee stock purchase plan grants is estimated at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. In addition, we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate of our stock grants and only recognize the expense for those shares expected to vest. If our actual experience differs significantly from the assumptions used to compute our stock-based compensation cost, or if different assumptions had been used, we may have recorded too much or too little stock-based compensation cost. See Note 12, Stock-Based Compensation, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Investments in auction-rate securities - We determine the fair value of our investments in auction-rate securities using a discounted cash flow model. The assumptions used in preparing the discounted cash flow model include estimates for interest rates, amount of cash flows, expected holding periods of the securities and a discount to reflect our inability to liquidate the securities. For available-for-sale auction-rate securities, if the calculated value is below the carrying amount of the securities, we then determine if the decline in value is other-than-temporary. We consider various factors in determining whether an impairment is other-than-temporary, including the severity and duration of the impairment, changes in underlying credit ratings, forecasted recovery, our intent to sell or the likelihood that we would be required to sell the investment before its anticipated recovery in market value and the probability that the scheduled cash payments will continue to be made. When we conclude that an other-than-temporary impairment has occurred, we assess whether we intend to sell the security or if it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery. If either of these two conditions is met, we recognize a charge in earnings equal to the entire difference between the security's amortized cost basis and its fair value. If we do not intend to sell a security and it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery, the unrealized loss is separated into an amount representing the credit loss, which is recognized in earnings, and the amount related to all other factors, which is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Acquired intangible assets - When we acquire a business, a portion of the purchase price is typically allocated to identifiable intangible assets, such as acquired technology and customer relationships. Fair value of these assets is determined primarily using the income approach, which requires us to project future cash flows and apply an appropriate discount rate. We amortize intangible assets with finite lives over their expected useful lives. Our estimates are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable. Assumptions may be incomplete or inaccurate, and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur. Incorrect estimates could result in future impairment charges, and those charges could be material to our results of operations. 45 Table of Contents Impairment of goodwill and other long-lived assets - We review long-lived assets which are held and used, including fixed assets and purchased intangible assets, for impairment whenever changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. Such evaluations compare the carrying amount of an asset to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset over its expected useful life and are significantly impacted by estimates of future prices and volumes for our products, capital needs, economic trends and other factors which are inherently difficult to forecast. If the asset is considered to be impaired, we record an impairment charge equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value determined by either a quoted market price, if any, or a value determined by utilizing a discounted cash flow technique. We test our goodwill for impairment annually as of the first day of our fourth fiscal quarter and in interim periods if certain events occur indicating that the carrying value of goodwill may be impaired. The goodwill impairment test is a two-step process. The first step of the impairment analysis compares our fair value to our net book value. In determining fair value, the accounting guidance allows for the use of several valuation methodologies, although it states quoted market prices are the best evidence of fair value. If the fair value is less than the net book value, the second step of the analysis compares the implied fair value of our goodwill to its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, we recognize an impairment loss equal to that excess amount. Income taxes - We are required to calculate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. This process involves calculating the actual current tax liability together with assessing temporary differences in recognition of income (loss) for tax and accounting purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included in our Consolidated Balance Sheet. We record a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we are required to estimate the amount of expected future taxable income. Judgment is inherent in this process and differences between the estimated and actual taxable income could result in a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. We recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a two-step process. The first step requires us to determine whether the weight of available evidence indicates that the tax position has met the threshold for recognition. Therefore, we must evaluate whether it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes. The second step requires us to measure the tax benefit of the tax position taken, or expected to be taken, in an income tax return as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. This measurement step is inherently complex and requires subjective estimations of such amounts to determine the probability of various possible outcomes. We re-evaluate the uncertain tax positions each quarter based on factors including, but not limited to, changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, expirations of statutes of limitation, effectively settled issues under audit, and new audit activity. Such a change in recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision in the period. Although we believe the measurement of our liabilities for uncertain tax positions is reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final outcome of these matters will not be different than what is reflected in the historical income tax provisions and accruals. If additional taxes are assessed as a result of an audit or litigation, they could have a material effect on our income tax provision and net income in the period or periods for which that determination is made. We operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions and are subject to audit in these jurisdictions. These audits can involve complex issues which may require an extended period of time to resolve and could result in additional assessments of income tax. We believe adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for all periods. 46 Table of Contents Recent Accounting Pronouncements Recent accounting pronouncements which we believe may materially impact the judgments and uncertainties in the application of our accounting policies are described below. See Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842). The core principle of Topic 842 is that a lessee should recognize the assets and liabilities that arise from leases. For operating leases, a lessee is required to recognize a right-of-use asset and a lease liability, initially measured at the present value of the lease payments, in the statement of financial position. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. We are evaluating the effect that the adoption of this ASU will have on our financial statements. We currently expect that most of our operating lease commitments will be subject to the new standard and recognized as right-of-use assets and operating lease liabilities upon our adoption of ASU 2016-02, which will increase our total assets and total liabilities that we report relative to such amounts prior to adoption. In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), which supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 605, Revenue Recognition. The core principle of ASU 2014-09 is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The guidance provides a five-step process to achieve that core principle. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date, which deferred the effective date of ASU 2014-09 to annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period. In 2016, the FASB issued the following amendments to ASC 606: ASU No. 2016-08, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net), which clarifies the implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations; ASU No. 2016-10, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing, which clarifies guidance on identification of performance obligations and licensing implementation; ASU No. 2016-12, Compensation - Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients, which provides clarifying guidance on assessing collectibility, presentation of sales taxes, noncash consideration, contract modifications and completed contracts; and ASU No. 2016-20, Technical Corrections and Improvements to Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which clarifies narrow aspects of ASC 606 or corrects unintended application of the guidance. The standard may be applied retrospectively to each prior period presented (full retrospective method) or retrospectively with the cumulative effect recognized as of the date of initial application (modified retrospective method). Under the new standard, we expect the timing of revenue recognition from sales to distributors to be accelerated. We will recognize revenue at the time of sale to the distributor, net of the impact of estimated price adjustments and rights of return. As a result, revenue recognition is expected to be more directly impacted by shipments to distributors. We will adopt this standard using the modified retrospective method. Under this method, incremental disclosures will be provided to present each financial statement line item for fiscal 2018 under the prior standard. We are substantially complete with our evaluation of the effect that the adoption will have on our financial statements. In connection with our adoption of ASC 606, we expect to record a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings of $26.2 million on December 31, 2017. This adjustment reflects the acceleration of $49.1 million in revenues and $19.7 million in costs of revenues as well as other items. 47 Table of Contents","Item 7A.    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Interest Income Our investment portfolio includes cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and long-term investments. Our main investment objectives are the preservation of investment capital and the maximization of after-tax returns on our investment portfolio. Our interest income is sensitive to changes in the general level of U.S. interest rates. A 100 basis point decline in yield on our investment portfolio holdings as of December 30, 2017 would decrease our future annual interest income by approximately $7.1 million. Our investment portfolio holdings as of December 31, 2016 yielded less than 100 basis points. A decline in yield to zero basis points on our investment portfolio holdings as of December 31, 2016 would have decreased our future annual interest income by approximately $1.9 million. The increase in annual interest income in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 was primarily due to increased expected interest income earned as a result of higher market interest rates and higher cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments balances. We believe that our investment policy, which defines the duration, concentration, and minimum credit quality of the allowable investments, meets our investment objectives. Interest Expense We are exposed to interest rate fluctuations in the normal course of our business, including through our Credit Facility. The interest rate on the Credit Facility consists of a variable-rate of interest and an applicable margin. While we have drawn from the Credit Facility in the past, we have no borrowings as of December 30, 2017. If we borrow from the Credit Facility in the future, we will again be exposed to interest rate fluctuations. Foreign currency exchange rate risk We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk primarily through assets and liabilities of our subsidiaries denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Our foreign subsidiaries are considered to be extensions of the U.S. parent. The functional currency of the foreign subsidiaries is the U.S. dollar. Accordingly, gains and losses resulting from remeasuring transactions denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars are recorded in interest income and other, net in the Consolidated Statements of Income. We use foreign currency forward contracts to manage exposure to foreign exchange risk. Gains and losses on foreign currency forward contracts are recognized in earnings in the same period as the remeasurement loss and gain of the related foreign currency denominated asset or liability. Investments in Auction-rate Securities As of December 30, 2017, we held $6.0 million par value auction-rate securities, all of which have experienced failed auctions because sell orders exceeded buy orders. We are unable to predict if these funds will become available before their maturity dates. Additionally, if we determine that an other-than-temporary decline in the fair value of any of our available-for-sale auction-rate securities has occurred, we may be required to adjust the carrying value of the investments through an impairment charge.","Item 8.    Financial Statements and Supplementary Data The Financial Statements and supplementary data required by this item are included in Part IV, Item 15 of this Form 10-K and are presented beginning on page F-1. 48 Table of Contents","Item 9A.    Controls and Procedures We have performed an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Chief Financial Officer (CFO), of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act). Based on that evaluation, our management, including our CEO and CFO, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 30, 2017 to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports filed or submitted by us under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms. Such disclosure controls and procedures include controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our CEO and CFO, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. There was no change in our internal controls during the fiscal quarter ended December 30, 2017 that materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting. Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Our internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance to our management and Board of Directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements. Our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 30, 2017. In making this assessment, it used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013 framework). Based on our assessment we concluded that, as of December 30, 2017, our internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria. Our independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst & Young LLP, issued an attestation report on our internal control over financial reporting.

"Facebook Inc","10-K","2018","1","Item 1.Business Overview Our mission is to give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together. Our top priority is to build useful and engaging products that enable people to connect and share with friends and family through mobile devices, personal computers, and other surfaces. We also help people discover and learn about what is going on in the world around them, enable people to share their opinions, ideas, photos and videos, and other activities with audiences ranging from their closest friends to the public at large, and stay connected everywhere by accessing our products, including:  Facebook. Facebook enables people to connect, share, discover, and communicate with each other on mobile devices and personal computers. There are a number of different ways to engage with people on Facebook, the most important of which is News Feed which displays an algorithmically-ranked series of stories and advertisements individualized for each person.  Instagram. Instagram is a community for sharing visual stories through photos, videos, and direct messages. Instagram is also a place for people to stay connected with the interests and communities that they care about.  Messenger. Messenger is a messaging application that makes it easy for people to connect with other people, groups and businesses across a variety of platforms and devices.  WhatsApp. WhatsApp is a fast, simple, and reliable messaging application that is used by people around the world to connect securely and privately.  Oculus. Our Oculus virtual reality technology and content platform power products that allow people to enter a completely immersive and interactive environment to train, learn, play games, consume content, and connect with others. We generate substantially all of our revenue from selling advertising placements to marketers. Our ads enable marketers to reach people based on a variety of factors including age, gender, location, interests, and behaviors. Marketers purchase ads that can appear in multiple places including on Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and third-party applications and websites. We are also investing in a number of longer-term initiatives, such as connectivity efforts, artificial intelligence research, and augmented and virtual reality, to develop technologies that we believe will help us better serve our communities and pursue our mission to give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together. Competition Our business is characterized by innovation, rapid change, and disruptive technologies. We compete with companies that sell advertising, as well as with companies that provide social, media, and communication products and services that are designed to engage users on mobile devices and online. We face significant competition in every aspect of our business, including from companies that facilitate communication and the sharing of content and information, companies that enable marketers to display advertising, companies that distribute video and other forms of media content, and companies that provide development platforms for applications developers. We compete to attract, engage, and retain people who use our products, to attract and retain marketers, and to attract and retain developers to build compelling mobile and web applications that integrate with our products. We also compete with the following:  Companies that offer products across broad platforms that replicate capabilities we provide. For example, Google has integrated social functionality into a number of its products, including search, video, and Android.  Companies that develop applications, particularly mobile applications, that provide social or other communications functionality, such as messaging, photo- and video-sharing, and micro-blogging.  Companies that provide regional social networks that have strong positions in particular countries.  Traditional, online, and mobile businesses that provide media for marketers to reach their audiences and/or develop tools and systems for managing and optimizing advertising campaigns.  Companies that develop and deliver virtual reality products and services. 5 As we introduce or acquire new products, as our existing products evolve, or as other companies introduce new products and services, we may become subject to additional competition. Technology Our product development philosophy is centered on continuous innovation in creating and improving products that are social by design, which means that our products are designed to place people and their social interactions at the core of the product experience. As our user base grows, and the level of engagement from the people who use our products continues to increase, including with video, our computing needs continue to expand. We make significant investments in technology both to improve our existing products and services and to develop new ones, as well as for our marketers and developers. We are also investing in protecting the security and integrity of our platform by investing in both people and technology to strengthen our systems against abuse. Our technology investments included research and development expenses of $7.75 billion, $5.92 billion and $4.82 billion in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. For information about our research and development expenses, see Part II, Item 7, ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Results of Operations - Research and development"" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Sales and Operations The majority of our marketers use our self-service ad platform to launch and manage their advertising campaigns. We also have a global sales force that is focused on attracting and retaining advertisers and providing support to them throughout the stages of the marketing cycle from pre-purchase decision-making to real-time optimizations to post-campaign analytics. We work directly with these advertisers, through traditional advertising agencies, and with an ecosystem of specialized agencies and partners. We currently operate six support offices and more than 40 sales offices around the globe. We also invest in and rely on self-service tools to provide direct customer support to our users and partners. Marketing To date, our communities have grown organically with people inviting their friends to connect with them, supported by internal efforts to stimulate awareness and interest. In addition, we have invested and will continue to invest in marketing our products and services to build our brand, grow our user base, and increase engagement around the world. We leverage the utility of our products and our social distribution channels as our most effective marketing tools. Intellectual Property To establish and protect our proprietary rights, we rely on a combination of patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, including know-how, license agreements, confidentiality procedures, non-disclosure agreements with third parties, employee disclosure and invention assignment agreements, and other contractual rights. In addition, to further protect our proprietary rights, from time to time we have purchased patents and patent applications from third parties. We do not believe that our proprietary technology is dependent on any single patent or copyright or groups of related patents or copyrights. We believe the duration of our patents is adequate relative to the expected lives of our products. Government Regulation We are subject to a number of U.S. federal and state and foreign laws and regulations that affect companies conducting business on the Internet. Many of these laws and regulations are still evolving and being tested in courts, and could be interpreted in ways that could harm our business. These may involve user privacy, data protection and personal information, rights of publicity, content, intellectual property, advertising, marketing, distribution, data security, data retention and deletion, electronic contracts and other communications, competition, protection of minors, consumer protection, telecommunications, product liability, taxation, economic or other trade prohibitions or sanctions, securities law compliance, and online payment services. In particular, we are subject to federal, state, and foreign laws regarding privacy and protection of people's data. Foreign data protection, privacy, content, competition, and other laws and regulations can be more restrictive than those in the United States. U.S. federal and state and foreign laws and regulations, which in some cases can be enforced by private parties in addition to government entities, are constantly evolving and can be subject to significant change. As a result, the application, interpretation, and enforcement of these laws and regulations are often uncertain, particularly in the new and rapidly evolving industry in which we operate, and may be interpreted and applied inconsistently from country to country and inconsistently with our current policies and practices. Proposed or new legislation and regulations could also significantly affect our business. There currently are a number of proposals pending before federal, state, and foreign legislative and regulatory bodies. In addition, the new European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) will take effect in May 2018 and will apply to all of our products and services that provide service in Europe. The GDPR will include operational requirements for companies that receive or process personal data of residents of the European Union that are different than those currently in place in the European Union, and will include significant penalties for non- 6 compliance. Similarly, there are a number of legislative proposals in the United States, at both the federal and state level, that could impose new obligations in areas affecting our business, such as liability for copyright infringement by third parties. In addition, some countries are considering or have passed legislation implementing data protection requirements or requiring local storage and processing of data or similar requirements that could increase the cost and complexity of delivering our services. We are currently, and may in the future be, subject to regulatory orders or consent decrees. Violation of existing or future regulatory orders or consent decrees could subject us to substantial monetary fines and other penalties that could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations. Various laws and regulations in the United States and abroad, such as the U.S. Bank Secrecy Act, the Dodd-Frank Act, the USA PATRIOT Act, and the Credit CARD Act, impose certain anti-money laundering requirements on companies that are financial institutions or that provide financial products and services. Under these laws and regulations, financial institutions are broadly defined to include money services businesses such as money transmitters, check cashers, and sellers or issuers of stored value or prepaid access products. Requirements imposed on financial institutions under these laws include customer identification and verification programs, record retention policies and procedures, and transaction reporting. To increase flexibility in how our online payments infrastructure (Payments) may evolve and to mitigate regulatory uncertainty, we have received certain money transmitter licenses in the United States and an Electronic Money (E-Money) license that allows us to conduct certain regulated payment activities in the participating member countries of the European Economic Area, which will generally require us to demonstrate compliance with many domestic and foreign laws relating to money transmission, gift cards and other prepaid access instruments, electronic funds transfers, anti-money laundering, charitable fundraising, counter-terrorist financing, gambling, banking and lending, financial privacy and data security, and import and export restrictions.

Risk Factors Certain factors may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. You should consider carefully the risks and uncertainties described below, in addition to other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including our consolidated financial statements and related notes. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of, or that we currently believe are not material, may also become important factors that adversely affect our business. If any of the following risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and future prospects could be materially and adversely affected. In that event, the trading price of our Class A common stock could decline, and you could lose part or all of your investment. Risks Related to Our Business and Industry If we fail to retain existing users or add new users, or if our users decrease their level of engagement with our products, our revenue, financial results, and business may be significantly harmed. The size of our user base and our users' level of engagement are critical to our success. Our financial performance has been and will continue to be significantly determined by our success in adding, retaining, and engaging active users of our products, particularly for Facebook and Instagram. We anticipate that our active user growth rate will continue to decline over time as the size of our active user base increases, and it is possible that the size of our active user base may fluctuate or decline in one or more markets, particularly in markets where we have achieved higher penetration rates. For example, in the fourth quarter of 2017, we experienced a slight decline on a quarter-over-quarter basis in the number of daily active users on Facebook in the United States & Canada region. If people do not perceive our products to be useful, reliable, and trustworthy, we may not be able to attract or retain users or otherwise maintain or increase the frequency and duration of their engagement. A number of other social networking companies that achieved early popularity have since seen their active user bases or levels of engagement decline, in some cases precipitously. There is no guarantee that we will not experience a similar erosion of our active user base or engagement levels. Our user engagement patterns have changed over time, and user engagement can be difficult to measure, particularly as we introduce new and different products and services. Any number of factors could potentially negatively affect user retention, growth, and engagement, including if:  users increasingly engage with other competitive products or services;  we fail to introduce new features, products or services that users find engaging or if we introduce new products or services, or make changes to existing products and services, that are not favorably received;  users feel that their experience is diminished as a result of the decisions we make with respect to the frequency, prominence, format, size, and quality of ads that we display;  users have difficulty installing, updating, or otherwise accessing our products on mobile devices as a result of actions by us or third parties that we rely on to distribute our products and deliver our services;  user behavior on any of our products changes, including decreases in the quality and frequency of content shared on our products and services;  we are unable to continue to develop products for mobile devices that users find engaging, that work with a variety of mobile operating systems and networks, and that achieve a high level of market acceptance;  there are decreases in user sentiment about the quality or usefulness of our products or concerns related to privacy and sharing, safety, security, or other factors;  we are unable to manage and prioritize information to ensure users are presented with content that is appropriate, interesting, useful, and relevant to them;  we are unable to obtain or attract engaging third-party content;  users adopt new technologies where our products may be displaced in favor of other products or services, or may not be featured or otherwise available;  there are adverse changes in our products that are mandated by legislation, regulatory authorities, or litigation;  there is decreased engagement or acceptance of product features on our service, or decreased acceptance of our terms of service, as part of changes that may be implemented in connection with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in Europe;  technical or other problems prevent us from delivering our products in a rapid and reliable manner or otherwise affect 8 the user experience, such as security breaches or failure to prevent or limit spam or similar content;  we adopt terms, policies, or procedures related to areas such as sharing, content, user data, or advertising that are perceived negatively by our users or the general public;  we elect to focus our product decisions on longer-term initiatives that do not prioritize near-term user growth and engagement, or if initiatives designed to attract and retain users and engagement are unsuccessful or discontinued, whether as a result of actions by us, third parties, or otherwise;  we fail to provide adequate customer service to users, marketers, developers, or other partners;  we, developers whose products are integrated with our products, or other partners and companies in our industry are the subject of adverse media reports or other negative publicity; or  our current or future products, such as our development tools and application programming interfaces that enable developers to build, grow, and monetize mobile and web applications, reduce user activity on our products by making it easier for our users to interact and share on third-party mobile and web applications. If we are unable to maintain or increase our user base and user engagement, our revenue and financial results may be adversely affected. Any decrease in user retention, growth, or engagement could render our products less attractive to users, marketers, and developers, which is likely to have a material and adverse impact on our revenue, business, financial condition, and results of operations. If our active user growth rate continues to slow, we will become increasingly dependent on our ability to maintain or increase levels of user engagement and monetization in order to drive revenue growth. We generate substantially all of our revenue from advertising. The loss of marketers, or reduction in spending by marketers, could seriously harm our business. Substantially all of our revenue is currently generated from third parties advertising on Facebook and Instagram. For 2017, 2016, and 2015, advertising accounted for 98%, 97% and 95%, respectively, of our revenue. As is common in the industry, our marketers do not have long-term advertising commitments with us. Many of our marketers spend only a relatively small portion of their overall advertising budget with us. Marketers will not continue to do business with us, or they will reduce the budgets they are willing to commit to us, if we do not deliver ads in an effective manner, or if they do not believe that their investment in advertising with us will generate a competitive return relative to other alternatives. In addition, our advertising revenue growth has become increasingly dependent upon increased pricing of our ads. If we are unable to provide marketers with a suitable return on investment, the pricing of our ads may not increase, or may decline, in which case our revenue and financial results may be harmed. Our advertising revenue could also be adversely affected by a number of other factors, including:  decreases in user engagement, including time spent on our products;  our inability to continue to increase user access to and engagement with our mobile products;  product changes or inventory management decisions we may make that change the size, format, frequency, or relative prominence of ads displayed on our products or of other unpaid content shared by marketers on our products;  our inability to maintain or increase marketer demand, the pricing of our ads, or both;  our inability to maintain or increase the quantity or quality of ads shown to users, including as a result of technical infrastructure constraints;  reductions of advertising by marketers due to our efforts to implement advertising policies that protect the security and integrity of our platform;  changes to third-party policies that limit our ability to deliver or target advertising on mobile devices;  the availability, accuracy, and utility of analytics and measurement solutions offered by us or third parties that demonstrate the value of our ads to marketers, or our ability to further improve such tools;  loss of advertising market share to our competitors, including if prices for purchasing ads increase or if competitors offer lower priced or more integrated products;  adverse government actions or legal developments relating to advertising, including legislative and regulatory developments and developments in litigation; 9  decisions by marketers to reduce their advertising as a result of adverse media reports or other negative publicity involving us, our advertising metrics or tools, content on our products, developers with mobile and web applications that are integrated with our products, or other companies in our industry;  reductions of advertising by marketers due to objectionable content published on our products by third parties;  the effectiveness of our ad targeting or degree to which users opt out of certain types of ad targeting, including as a result of product changes and controls that may be implemented in connection with the GDPR or other regulation or regulatory action;  the degree to which users cease or reduce the number of times they engage with our ads;  changes in the way advertising on mobile devices or on personal computers is measured or priced; and  the impact of macroeconomic conditions, whether in the advertising industry in general, or among specific types of marketers or within particular geographies. The occurrence of any of these or other factors could result in a reduction in demand for our ads, which may reduce the prices we receive for our ads, or cause marketers to stop advertising with us altogether, either of which would negatively affect our revenue and financial results. Our user growth, engagement, and monetization on mobile devices depend upon effective operation with mobile operating systems, networks, and standards that we do not control. The substantial majority of our revenue is generated from advertising on mobile devices. There is no guarantee that popular mobile devices will continue to feature Facebook or our other products, or that mobile device users will continue to use our products rather than competing products. We are dependent on the interoperability of Facebook and our other products with popular mobile operating systems, networks, and standards that we do not control, such as the Android and iOS operating systems. Any changes, bugs, or technical issues in such systems, or changes in our relationships with mobile operating system partners, handset manufacturers, or mobile carriers, or in their terms of service or policies that degrade our products' functionality, reduce or eliminate our ability to distribute our products, give preferential treatment to competitive products, limit our ability to deliver, target, or measure the effectiveness of ads, or charge fees related to the distribution of our products or our delivery of ads could adversely affect the usage of Facebook or our other products and monetization on mobile devices. Additionally, in order to deliver high quality mobile products, it is important that our products work well with a range of mobile technologies, systems, networks, and standards that we do not control, and that we have good relationships with handset manufacturers and mobile carriers. We may not be successful in maintaining or developing relationships with key participants in the mobile ecosystem or in developing products that operate effectively with these technologies, systems, networks, or standards. In the event that it is more difficult for our users to access and use Facebook or our other products on their mobile devices, or if our users choose not to access or use Facebook or our other products on their mobile devices or use mobile products that do not offer access to Facebook or our other products, our user growth and user engagement could be harmed. From time to time, we may also take actions regarding the distribution of our products or the operation of our business based on what we believe to be in our long-term best interests. Such actions may adversely affect our users and our relationships with the operators of mobile operating systems, handset manufacturers, mobile carriers, or other business partners, and there is no assurance that these actions will result in the anticipated long-term benefits. In the event that our users are adversely affected by these actions or if our relationships with such third parties deteriorate, our user growth, engagement, and monetization could be adversely affected and our business could be harmed. Our business is highly competitive. Competition presents an ongoing threat to the success of our business. We compete with companies that sell advertising, as well as with companies that provide social, media, and communication products and services that are designed to engage users on mobile devices and online. We face significant competition in every aspect of our business, including from companies that facilitate communication and the sharing of content and information, companies that enable marketers to display advertising, companies that distribute video and other forms of media content, and companies that provide development platforms for applications developers. We compete with companies that offer products across broad platforms that replicate capabilities we provide. For example, Google has integrated social functionality into a number of its products, including search, video, and Android. We also compete with companies that develop applications, particularly mobile applications, that provide social or other communications functionality, such as messaging, photo- and video-sharing, and micro-blogging, as well as companies that provide regional social networks that have strong positions in particular countries. In addition, we face competition from traditional, online, and mobile businesses that provide media for marketers to reach their audiences and/or develop tools and systems for managing and optimizing advertising campaigns. We also compete with companies that develop and deliver virtual reality products and services. Some of our current and potential competitors may have significantly greater resources or stronger competitive positions in 10 certain product segments, geographic regions, or user demographics than we do. These factors may allow our competitors to respond more effectively than us to new or emerging technologies and changes in market conditions. We believe that some users, particularly younger users, are aware of and actively engaging with other products and services similar to, or as a substitute for, Facebook products and services, and we believe that some users have reduced their use of and engagement with our products and services in favor of these other products and services. In the event that users increasingly engage with other products and services, we may experience a decline in use and engagement in key user demographics or more broadly, in which case our business would likely be harmed. Our competitors may develop products, features, or services that are similar to ours or that achieve greater acceptance, may undertake more far-reaching and successful product development efforts or marketing campaigns, or may adopt more aggressive pricing policies. In addition, developers whose mobile and web applications are integrated with Facebook or our other products may use information shared by our users through our products in order to develop products or features that compete with us. Some competitors may gain a competitive advantage against us in areas where we operate, including: by integrating competing platforms, applications, or features into products they control such as mobile device operating systems, search engines, or web browsers; by making acquisitions; by limiting our ability to deliver, target, or measure the effectiveness of ads; by imposing fees or other charges related to our delivery of ads; by making access to our products more difficult; or by making it more difficult to communicate with our users. As a result, our competitors may acquire and engage users or generate advertising or other revenue at the expense of our own efforts, which may negatively affect our business and financial results. In addition, from time to time, we may take actions in response to competitive threats, but we cannot assure you that these actions will be successful or that they will not negatively affect our business and financial results. We believe that our ability to compete effectively depends upon many factors both within and beyond our control, including:  the popularity, usefulness, ease of use, performance, and reliability of our products compared to our competitors' products;  the size and composition of our user base;  the engagement of users with our products and competing products;  the timing and market acceptance of products, including developments and enhancements to our or our competitors' products;  our ability to distribute our products to new and existing users;  our ability to monetize our products;  the frequency, size, format, quality, and relative prominence of the ads displayed by us or our competitors;  customer service and support efforts;  marketing and selling efforts, including our ability to measure the effectiveness of our ads and to provide marketers with a compelling return on their investments;  our ability to establish and maintain developers' interest in building mobile and web applications that integrate with Facebook and our other products;  our ability to establish and maintain publisher interest in integrating their content with Facebook and our other products;  changes mandated by legislation, regulatory authorities, or litigation, some of which may have a disproportionate effect on us;  acquisitions or consolidation within our industry, which may result in more formidable competitors;  our ability to attract, retain, and motivate talented employees, particularly software engineers, designers, and product managers;  our ability to cost-effectively manage and grow our operations; and  our reputation and brand strength relative to those of our competitors. If we are not able to compete effectively, our user base and level of user engagement may decrease, we may become less attractive to developers and marketers, and our revenue and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected. 11 Action by governments to restrict access to Facebook or our other products in their countries could substantially harm our business and financial results. It is possible that governments of one or more countries may seek to censor content available on Facebook or our other products in their country, restrict access to our products from their country entirely, or impose other restrictions that may affect the accessibility of our products in their country for an extended period of time or indefinitely. For example, user access to Facebook and certain of our other products has been or is currently restricted in whole or in part in China, Iran, and North Korea. In addition, government authorities in other countries may seek to restrict user access to our products if they consider us to be in violation of their laws or a threat to public safety or for other reasons, and certain of our products have been restricted by governments in other countries from time to time. It is also possible that government authorities could take action to restrict our ability to sell advertising. In the event that content shown on Facebook or our other products is subject to censorship, access to our products is restricted, in whole or in part, in one or more countries, or other restrictions are imposed on our products, or our competitors are able to successfully penetrate new geographic markets or capture a greater share of existing geographic markets that we cannot access or where we face other restrictions, our ability to retain or increase our user base, user engagement, or the level of advertising by marketers may be adversely affected, we may not be able to maintain or grow our revenue as anticipated, and our financial results could be adversely affected. Our new products and changes to existing products could fail to attract or retain users or generate revenue and profits. Our ability to retain, increase, and engage our user base and to increase our revenue depends heavily on our ability to continue to evolve our existing products and to create successful new products, both independently and in conjunction with developers or other third parties. We may introduce significant changes to our existing products or acquire or introduce new and unproven products, including using technologies with which we have little or no prior development or operating experience. For example, in March 2016, we shipped our first virtual reality hardware product, the Oculus Rift. In addition, we have announced plans to develop augmented reality technology and products. We do not have significant experience with consumer hardware products or virtual or augmented reality technology, which may adversely affect our ability to successfully develop and market these products and technologies, and we will incur increased costs in connection with the development and marketing of such products and technologies. We have also invested, and expect to continue to invest, significant resources in growing our WhatsApp and Messenger products. We have historically monetized messaging in only a very limited fashion, and we may not be successful in our efforts to generate meaningful revenue from messaging over the long term. If these or other new or enhanced products fail to engage users, marketers, or developers, or if we are unsuccessful in our monetization efforts, we may fail to attract or retain users or to generate sufficient revenue, operating margin, or other value to justify our investments, and our business may be adversely affected. We make product and investment decisions that may not prioritize short-term financial results and may not produce the long-term benefits that we expect. We frequently make product and investment decisions that may not prioritize short-term financial results if we believe that the decisions are consistent with our mission and benefit the aggregate user experience and will thereby improve our financial performance over the long term. For example, from time to time we may change the size, frequency, or relative prominence of ads in order to improve ad quality and overall user experience. Similarly, we recently announced changes to our News Feed ranking algorithm to help our users have more meaningful social interactions, and we expect that these changes will have the effect of reducing time spent and some measures of user engagement with Facebook, which could adversely affect our financial results. From time to time, we have also made, and expect to continue to make, other changes to our products which may adversely affect the distribution of content of publishers, marketers, and developers, and could reduce their incentive to invest in their efforts on Facebook. We also may introduce new features or other changes to existing products, or introduce new stand-alone products, that attract users away from properties, formats, or use cases where we have more proven means of monetization. For example, the Stories format is becoming increasingly popular for sharing content across our products, and we do not currently monetize Stories at the same rate as News Feed. In addition, we plan to continue focusing on growing users and engagement on Instagram, Messenger, and WhatsApp, and we may also introduce other stand-alone applications in the future. These efforts may reduce engagement with the core Facebook application, where we have the most proven means of monetization and which serves as the platform for many of our new user experiences. These decisions may adversely affect our business and results of operations and may not produce the long-term benefits that we expect. 12 If we are not able to maintain and enhance our brands, or if events occur that damage our reputation and brands, our ability to expand our base of users, marketers, and developers may be impaired, and our business and financial results may be harmed. We believe that our brands have significantly contributed to the success of our business. We also believe that maintaining and enhancing our brands is critical to expanding our base of users, marketers, and developers. Many of our new users are referred by existing users. Maintaining and enhancing our brands will depend largely on our ability to continue to provide useful, reliable, trustworthy, and innovative products, which we may not do successfully. We may introduce new products or terms of service or policies that users do not like, which may negatively affect our brands. Additionally, the actions of our developers or advertisers may affect our brands if users do not have a positive experience using third-party mobile and web applications integrated with our products or interacting with parties that advertise through our products. We will also continue to experience media, legislative, or regulatory scrutiny of our decisions regarding user privacy, content, advertising, and other issues, which may adversely affect our reputation and brands. For example, we previously announced our discovery of certain ads and other content previously displayed on our products that may be relevant to government investigations relating to Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. We also may fail to respond expeditiously to the sharing of objectionable content on our services or objectionable practices by advertisers, or to otherwise address user concerns, which could erode confidence in our brands. Our brands may also be negatively affected by the actions of users that are deemed to be hostile or inappropriate to other users, by the actions of users acting under false or inauthentic identities, by the use of our products or services to disseminate information that is deemed to be misleading (or intended to manipulate opinions), by perceived or actual efforts by governments to obtain access to user information for security-related purposes or to censor certain content on our platform, or by the use of our products or services for illicit, objectionable, or illegal ends. Maintaining and enhancing our brands may require us to make substantial investments and these investments may not be successful. Certain of our past actions have eroded confidence in our brands, and if we fail to successfully promote and maintain our brands or if we incur excessive expenses in this effort, our business and financial results may be adversely affected. Security breaches and improper access to or disclosure of our data or user data, or other hacking and phishing attacks on our systems, could harm our reputation and adversely affect our business. Our industry is prone to cyber-attacks by third parties seeking unauthorized access to our data or users' data or to disrupt our ability to provide service. Any failure to prevent or mitigate security breaches and improper access to or disclosure of our data or user data, including personal information, content or payment information from users, could result in the loss or misuse of such data, which could harm our business and reputation and diminish our competitive position. In addition, computer malware, viruses, social engineering (predominantly spear phishing attacks), and general hacking have become more prevalent in our industry, have occurred on our systems in the past, and will occur on our systems in the future. We also regularly encounter attempts to create false or undesirable user accounts, purchase ads, or take other actions on our platform for purposes such as spamming, spreading misinformation, or other objectionable ends. As a result of our prominence, the size of our user base, and the types and volume of personal data on our systems, we believe that we are a particularly attractive target for such breaches and attacks. Such attacks may cause interruptions to the services we provide, degrade the user experience, cause users to lose confidence and trust in our products, impair our internal systems, or result in financial harm to us. Our efforts to protect our company data or the information we receive may also be unsuccessful due to software bugs or other technical malfunctions; employee, contractor, or vendor error or malfeasance; government surveillance; or other threats that evolve. In addition, third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or users to disclose information in order to gain access to our data or our users' data. Cyber-attacks continue to evolve in sophistication and volume, and inherently may be difficult to detect for long periods of time. Although we have developed systems and processes that are designed to protect our data and user data, to prevent data loss, to disable undesirable accounts and activities on our platform, and to prevent or detect security breaches, we cannot assure you that such measures will provide absolute security, and we may incur significant costs in protecting against or remediating cyber-attacks. In addition, some of our developers or other partners, such as those that help us measure the effectiveness of ads, may receive or store information provided by us or by our users through mobile or web applications integrated with Facebook. We provide limited information to such third parties based on the scope of services provided to us. However, if these third parties or developers fail to adopt or adhere to adequate data security practices, or in the event of a breach of their networks, our data or our users' data may be improperly accessed, used, or disclosed. Affected users or government authorities could initiate legal or regulatory actions against us in connection with any security breaches or improper disclosure of data, which could cause us to incur significant expense and liability or result in orders or consent decrees forcing us to modify our business practices. Such incidents may also result in a decline in our active user base or engagement levels. Any of these events could have a material and adverse effect on our business, reputation, or financial results. 13 Unfavorable media coverage could negatively affect our business. We receive a high degree of media coverage around the world. Unfavorable publicity regarding, for example, our privacy practices, terms of service, product changes, product quality, litigation or regulatory activity, government surveillance, the actions of our advertisers, the actions of our developers whose products are integrated with our products, the use of our products or services for illicit, objectionable, or illegal ends, the actions of our users, the quality and integrity of content shared on our platform, or the actions of other companies that provide similar services to us, has in the past, and could in the future, adversely affect our reputation. Such negative publicity also could have an adverse effect on the size, engagement, and loyalty of our user base and result in decreased revenue, which could adversely affect our business and financial results. Our financial results will fluctuate from quarter to quarter and are difficult to predict. Our quarterly financial results have fluctuated in the past and will fluctuate in the future. Additionally, we have a limited operating history with the current scale of our business, which makes it difficult to forecast our future results. As a result, you should not rely upon our past quarterly financial results as indicators of future performance. You should take into account the risks and uncertainties frequently encountered by companies in rapidly evolving markets. Our financial results in any given quarter can be influenced by numerous factors, many of which we are unable to predict or are outside of our control, including:  our ability to maintain and grow our user base and user engagement;  our ability to attract and retain marketers in a particular period;  fluctuations in spending by our marketers due to seasonality, such as historically strong spending in the fourth quarter of each year, episodic regional or global events, or other factors;  the frequency, prominence, size, format, and quality of ads shown to users;  the success of technologies designed to block the display of ads;  the pricing of our ads and other products;  the diversification and growth of revenue sources beyond advertising on Facebook and Instagram;  our ability to generate revenue from Payments, or the sale of Oculus products and services or other products we may introduce in the future;  the development and introduction of new products or services by us or our competitors;  user behavior or product changes that may reduce traffic to features or products that we successfully monetize;  increases in marketing, sales, and other operating expenses that we will incur to grow and expand our operations and to remain competitive;  costs and expenses related to the development and delivery of Oculus products and services;  our ability to maintain gross margins and operating margins;  costs related to acquisitions, including costs associated with amortization and additional investments to develop the acquired technologies;  charges associated with impairment of any assets on our balance sheet;  our ability to obtain equipment, components, and labor for our data centers and other technical infrastructure in a timely and cost-effective manner;  system failures or outages, which could prevent us from serving ads for any period of time;  breaches of security or privacy, and the costs associated with any such breaches and remediation;  changes in the manner in which we distribute our products or inaccessibility of our products due to third-party actions;  fees paid to third parties for content or the distribution of our products;  share-based compensation expense, including acquisition-related expense; 14  adverse litigation judgments, settlements, or other litigation-related costs;  changes in the legislative or regulatory environment, including with respect to privacy and data protection, or enforcement by government regulators, including fines, orders, or consent decrees;  the overall tax rate for our business, which may be affected by the mix of income we earn in the U.S. and in jurisdictions with comparatively lower tax rates, the effects of share-based compensation, the effects of integrating intellectual property from acquisitions, and the effects of changes in our business;  the impact of changes in tax law, which are recorded in the period enacted and may significantly affect the effective tax rate of that period;  tax obligations that may arise from resolutions of tax examinations, including the examination we are currently under by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), that materially differ from the amounts we have anticipated;  fluctuations in currency exchange rates and changes in the proportion of our revenue and expenses denominated in foreign currencies;  fluctuations in the market values of our portfolio investments and in interest rates;  changes in U.S. generally accepted accounting principles; and  changes in global business or macroeconomic conditions. We expect our rates of growth to decline in the future. We expect that our user growth and revenue growth rates will decline over time as the size of our active user base increases, and it is possible that the size of our active user base may fluctuate or decline in one or more markets, particularly as we achieve greater market penetration. We expect our revenue growth rate will generally decline over time as our revenue increases to higher levels. As our growth rates decline, investors' perceptions of our business may be adversely affected and the trading price of our Class A common stock could decline. Our costs are continuing to grow, which could reduce our operating margin and profitability. If our investments are not successful, our business and financial performance could be harmed. Operating our business is costly, and we expect our expenses to continue to increase in the future as we broaden our user base, as users increase the amount and types of content they consume and the data they share with us, for example with respect to video, as we develop and implement new products, as we continue to expand our technical infrastructure, as we continue to invest in new and unproven technologies, and as we continue to hire additional employees to support our expanding operations. We will continue to invest in our messaging, security, video content, and global connectivity efforts, as well as other initiatives that may not have clear paths to monetization. In addition, we will incur increased costs in connection with the development and marketing of our Oculus products and services. Any such investments may not be successful, and any such increases in our costs may reduce our operating margin and profitability. In addition, if our investments are not successful, our ability to grow revenue will be harmed, which could adversely affect our business and financial performance. Given our levels of share-based compensation, our tax rate may vary significantly depending on our stock price. The tax effects of the accounting for share-based compensation may significantly impact our effective tax rate from period to period. In periods in which our stock price is higher than the grant price of the share-based compensation vesting in that period, we will recognize excess tax benefits that will decrease our effective tax rate. For example, in 2017, excess tax benefits recognized from share-based compensation decreased our provision for income taxes by $1.25 billion and our effective tax rate by six percentage points as compared to the tax rate without such benefits. In future periods in which our stock price is lower than the grant price of the share-based compensation vesting in that period, our effective tax rate may increase. The amount and value of share-based compensation issued relative to our earnings in a particular period will also affect the magnitude of the impact of share-based compensation on our effective tax rate. These tax effects are dependent on our stock price, which we do not control, and a decline in our stock price could significantly increase our effective tax rate and adversely affect our financial results. 15 Our business is subject to complex and evolving U.S. and foreign laws and regulations regarding privacy, data protection, content, competition, consumer protection, and other matters. Many of these laws and regulations are subject to change and uncertain interpretation, and could result in claims, changes to our business practices, monetary penalties, increased cost of operations, or declines in user growth or engagement, or otherwise harm our business. We are subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the United States and abroad that involve matters central to our business, including privacy, data protection and personal information, rights of publicity, content, intellectual property, advertising, marketing, distribution, data security, data retention and deletion, electronic contracts and other communications, competition, protection of minors, consumer protection, telecommunications, product liability, taxation, economic or other trade prohibitions or sanctions, securities law compliance, and online payment services. The introduction of new products, expansion of our activities in certain jurisdictions, or other actions that we may take may subject us to additional laws, regulations, or other government scrutiny. In addition, foreign data protection, privacy, content, competition, and other laws and regulations can impose different obligations or be more restrictive than those in the United States. These U.S. federal and state and foreign laws and regulations, which in some cases can be enforced by private parties in addition to government entities, are constantly evolving and can be subject to significant change. As a result, the application, interpretation, and enforcement of these laws and regulations are often uncertain, particularly in the new and rapidly evolving industry in which we operate, and may be interpreted and applied inconsistently from country to country and inconsistently with our current policies and practices. For example, regulatory or legislative actions affecting the manner in which we display content to our users or obtain consent to various practices could adversely affect user growth and engagement. Such actions could affect the manner in which we provide our services or adversely affect our financial results. We are also subject to laws and regulations that dictate whether, how, and under what circumstances we can transfer, process and/or receive certain data that is critical to our operations, including data shared between countries or regions in which we operate and data shared among our products and services. For example, in 2016, the European Union and United States agreed to an alternative transfer framework for data transferred from the European Union to the United States, called the Privacy Shield, but this new framework is subject to an annual review that could result in changes to our obligations and also may be challenged by national regulators or private parties. In addition, the other bases upon which Facebook relies to legitimize the transfer of such data, such as standard Model Contractual Clauses (MCCs), have been subjected to regulatory and judicial scrutiny. For example, the Irish Data Protection Commissioner has challenged the legal grounds for transfers of user data to Facebook, Inc., and the Irish High Court has agreed to refer this challenge to the Court of Justice of the European Union for decision. We also face multiple inquiries, investigations, and lawsuits in Europe, India, and other jurisdictions regarding the August 2016 update to WhatsApp's terms of service and privacy policy and its sharing of certain data with other Facebook products and services, including a lawsuit currently pending before the Supreme Court of India. If one or more of the legal bases for transferring data from Europe to the United States is invalidated, if we are unable to transfer data between and among countries and regions in which we operate, or if we are prohibited from sharing data among our products and services, it could affect the manner in which we provide our services or adversely affect our financial results. Proposed or new legislation and regulations could also significantly affect our business. There currently are a number of proposals pending before federal, state, and foreign legislative and regulatory bodies. In addition, the new European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) will take effect in May 2018 and will apply to all of our products and services that provide service in Europe. The GDPR will include operational requirements for companies that receive or process personal data of residents of the European Union that are different than those currently in place in the European Union. For example, we may be required to implement measures to change our service or limit access to our service for minors under the age of 16 for certain countries in Europe that maintain the minimum age of 16 under the GDPR. We may also be required to obtain consent and/or offer new controls to existing and new users in Europe before processing data for certain aspects of our service. In addition, the GDPR will include significant penalties for non-compliance. Similarly, there are a number of legislative proposals in the United States, at both the federal and state level, that could impose new obligations in areas affecting our business, such as liability for copyright infringement by third parties. In addition, some countries are considering or have passed legislation implementing data protection requirements or requiring local storage and processing of data or similar requirements that could increase the cost and complexity of delivering our services. These laws and regulations, as well as any associated inquiries or investigations or any other government actions, may be costly to comply with and may delay or impede the development of new products, result in negative publicity, increase our operating costs, require significant management time and attention, and subject us to remedies that may harm our business, including fines or demands or orders that we modify or cease existing business practices. 16 We have been subject to regulatory and other government investigations, enforcement actions, and settlements, and we expect to continue to be subject to such proceedings and other inquires in the future, which could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner materially adverse to our business. From time to time, we receive formal and informal inquiries from government authorities and regulators regarding our compliance with laws and regulations, many of which are evolving and subject to interpretation. We are and expect to continue to be the subject of investigations, inquiries, data requests, actions, and audits in the United States, Europe, and around the world, particularly in the areas of privacy, data protection, law enforcement, consumer protection, and competition, as we continue to grow and expand our operations. For example, several data protection authorities in the European Union have initiated actions, investigations, or administrative orders seeking to assert jurisdiction over Facebook, Inc. and our subsidiaries and to restrict the ways in which we collect and use information, and other data protection authorities may do the same. Orders issued by, or inquiries or enforcement actions initiated by, government or regulatory authorities could cause us to incur substantial costs, expose us to unanticipated civil and criminal liability or penalties (including substantial monetary fines), or require us to change our business practices in a manner materially adverse to our business. If we are unable to protect our intellectual property, the value of our brands and other intangible assets may be diminished, and our business may be adversely affected. We rely and expect to continue to rely on a combination of confidentiality, assignment, and license agreements with our employees, consultants, and third parties with whom we have relationships, as well as trademark, copyright, patent, trade secret, and domain name protection laws, to protect our proprietary rights. In the United States and internationally, we have filed various applications for protection of certain aspects of our intellectual property, and we currently hold a significant number of registered trademarks and issued patents in multiple jurisdictions and have acquired patents and patent applications from third parties. Third parties may knowingly or unknowingly infringe our proprietary rights, third parties may challenge proprietary rights held by us, and pending and future trademark and patent applications may not be approved. In addition, effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which we operate or intend to operate our business. In any or all of these cases, we may be required to expend significant time and expense in order to prevent infringement or to enforce our rights. Although we have generally taken measures to protect our proprietary rights, there can be no assurance that others will not offer products or concepts that are substantially similar to ours and compete with our business. In addition, we regularly contribute software source code under open source licenses and have made other technology we developed available under other open licenses, and we include open source software in our products. For example, we have contributed certain specifications and designs related to our data center equipment to the Open Compute Project Foundation, a non-profit entity that shares and develops such information with the technology community, under the Open Web Foundation License. As a result of our open source contributions and the use of open source in our products, we may license or be required to license or disclose code and/or innovations that turn out to be material to our business and may also be exposed to increased litigation risk. If the protection of our proprietary rights is inadequate to prevent unauthorized use or appropriation by third parties, the value of our brands and other intangible assets may be diminished and competitors may be able to more effectively mimic our products, services, and methods of operations. Any of these events could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results. We are currently, and expect to be in the future, party to patent lawsuits and other intellectual property rights claims that are expensive and time consuming and, if resolved adversely, could have a significant impact on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. Companies in the Internet, technology, and media industries own large numbers of patents, copyrights, trademarks, and trade secrets, and frequently enter into litigation based on allegations of infringement, misappropriation, or other violations of intellectual property or other rights. In addition, various ""non-practicing entities"" that own patents and other intellectual property rights often attempt to aggressively assert their rights in order to extract value from technology companies. Furthermore, from time to time we may introduce or acquire new products, including in areas where we historically have not competed, which could increase our exposure to patent and other intellectual property claims from competitors and non-practicing entities. From time to time, we receive notice from patent holders and other parties alleging that certain of our products and services, or user content, infringe their intellectual property rights. We presently are involved in a number of intellectual property lawsuits, and as we face increasing competition and gain an increasingly high profile, we expect the number of patent and other intellectual property claims against us to grow. Defending patent and other intellectual property litigation is costly and can impose a significant burden on management and employees, and there can be no assurances that favorable final outcomes will be obtained in all cases. In addition, plaintiffs may seek, and we may become subject to, preliminary or provisional rulings in the course of any such litigation, including potential preliminary injunctions requiring us to cease some or all of our operations. We may decide to settle such lawsuits and disputes on terms that are unfavorable to us. Similarly, if any litigation to which we are a party is resolved adversely, we may be subject to an unfavorable judgment that may not be reversed upon appeal. The terms of such a settlement or judgment may require us to cease some or all of our operations or pay substantial amounts to the other party. In addition, we may have to seek a license to continue practices 17 found to be in violation of a third party's rights, which may not be available on reasonable terms, or at all, and may significantly increase our operating costs and expenses. As a result, we may also be required to develop alternative non-infringing technology or practices or discontinue the practices. The development of alternative non-infringing technology or practices could require significant effort and expense or may not be feasible. Our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected as a result of an unfavorable resolution of the disputes and litigation referred to above. We are involved in numerous class action lawsuits and other litigation matters that are expensive and time consuming, and, if resolved adversely, could harm our business, financial condition, or results of operations. In addition to intellectual property claims, we are also involved in numerous other lawsuits, including putative class action lawsuits, many of which claim statutory damages and/or seek significant changes to our business operations, and we anticipate that we will continue to be a target for numerous lawsuits in the future. Because of the scale of our user base, the plaintiffs in class action cases filed against us typically claim enormous monetary damages even if the alleged per-user harm is small or non-existent. In addition, we may be subject to additional class action lawsuits based on employment claims, product performance or other claims related to the use of consumer hardware and software, as well as virtual reality technology and products, which are new and unproven. Any negative outcome from any such lawsuits could result in payments of substantial monetary damages or fines, or undesirable changes to our products or business practices, and accordingly our business, financial condition, or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. Although the results of such lawsuits and claims cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not believe that the final outcome of those matters relating to our products that we currently face will have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. In addition, we are currently the subject of stockholder class action suits in connection with our initial public offering (IPO). We believe these lawsuits are without merit and are vigorously defending these lawsuits. There can be no assurances that a favorable final outcome will be obtained in all our cases, and defending any lawsuit is costly and can impose a significant burden on management and employees. Any litigation to which we are a party may result in an onerous or unfavorable judgment that may not be reversed upon appeal or in payments of substantial monetary damages or fines, or we may decide to settle lawsuits on similarly unfavorable terms, which could adversely affect our business, financial conditions, or results of operations. We may incur liability as a result of information retrieved from or transmitted over the Internet or published using our products or as a result of claims related to our products. We have faced, currently face, and will continue to face claims relating to information that is published or made available on our products. In particular, the nature of our business exposes us to claims related to defamation, dissemination of misinformation or news hoaxes, discrimination, intellectual property rights, rights of publicity and privacy, personal injury torts, or laws regulating hate speech or other types of content. This risk is enhanced in certain jurisdictions outside the United States where our protection from liability for third-party actions may be unclear or where we may be less protected under local laws than we are in the United States. In addition, there have been various Congressional efforts to restrict the scope of the protections available to online platforms under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, and our current protections from liability for third-party content in the United States could decrease or change. We could incur significant costs investigating and defending such claims and, if we are found liable, significant damages. We could also face fines or orders restricting or blocking our services in particular geographies as a result of content hosted on our services. For example, recently enacted legislation in Germany may impose significant fines for failure to comply with certain content removal and disclosure obligations. If any of these events occur, our business and financial results could be adversely affected. Our CEO has control over key decision making as a result of his control of a majority of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock. Mark Zuckerberg, our founder, Chairman, and CEO, is able to exercise voting rights with respect to a majority of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock and therefore has the ability to control the outcome of matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, including the election of directors and any merger, consolidation, or sale of all or substantially all of our assets. This concentrated control could delay, defer, or prevent a change of control, merger, consolidation, or sale of all or substantially all of our assets that our other stockholders support, or conversely this concentrated control could result in the consummation of such a transaction that our other stockholders do not support. This concentrated control could also discourage a potential investor from acquiring our Class A common stock, which has limited voting power relative to the Class B common stock, and might harm the trading price of our Class A common stock. In addition, Mr. Zuckerberg has the ability to control the management and major strategic investments of our company as a result of his position as our CEO and his ability to control the election or replacement of our directors. In the event of his death, the shares of our capital stock that Mr. Zuckerberg owns will be transferred to the persons or entities that he has designated. As a board member and officer, Mr. Zuckerberg owes a fiduciary duty to our stockholders and must act in good faith in a manner he reasonably believes to be in the best interests of our stockholders. As a stockholder, even a controlling stockholder, Mr. Zuckerberg 18 is entitled to vote his shares, and shares over which he has voting control as governed by a voting agreement, in his own interests, which may not always be in the interests of our stockholders generally. We plan to continue to make acquisitions, which could harm our financial condition or results of operations and may adversely affect the price of our common stock. As part of our business strategy, we have made and intend to continue to make acquisitions to add specialized employees and complementary companies, products, or technologies. We may not be able to find suitable acquisition candidates, and we may not be able to complete acquisitions on favorable terms, if at all. In some cases, the costs of such acquisitions may be substantial. For example, in 2014 we paid approximately $4.6 billion in cash and issued 178 million shares of our Class A common stock in connection with our acquisition of WhatsApp, and we paid approximately $400 million in cash and issued 23 million shares of our Class B common stock in connection with our acquisition of Oculus. We also issued a substantial number of RSUs to help retain the employees of these companies. There is no assurance that we will receive a favorable return on investment for these or other acquisitions. We may pay substantial amounts of cash or incur debt to pay for acquisitions, which could adversely affect our liquidity. The incurrence of indebtedness would also result in increased fixed obligations and increased interest expense, and could also include covenants or other restrictions that would impede our ability to manage our operations. We may also issue equity securities to pay for acquisitions and we regularly grant RSUs to retain the employees of acquired companies, which could increase our expenses, adversely affect our financial results, and result in dilution to our stockholders. In addition, any acquisitions we announce could be viewed negatively by users, marketers, developers, or investors, which may adversely affect our business or the price of our Class A common stock. We may also discover liabilities or deficiencies associated with the companies or assets we acquire that were not identified in advance, which may result in significant unanticipated costs. The effectiveness of our due diligence review and our ability to evaluate the results of such due diligence are dependent upon the accuracy and completeness of statements and disclosures made or actions taken by the companies we acquire or their representatives, as well as the limited amount of time in which acquisitions are executed. In addition, we may fail to accurately forecast the financial impact of an acquisition transaction, including tax and accounting charges. Acquisitions may also result in our recording of significant additional expenses to our results of operations and recording of substantial finite-lived intangible assets on our balance sheet upon closing. Any of these factors may adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations. We may not be able to successfully integrate our acquisitions, and we may incur significant costs to integrate and support the companies we acquire. The integration of acquisitions requires significant time and resources, and we may not manage these processes successfully. Our ability to successfully integrate complex acquisitions is unproven, particularly with respect to companies that have significant operations or that develop products where we do not have prior experience. For example, Oculus and WhatsApp are larger and more complex than companies we have historically acquired. In particular, Oculus builds technology and products that are relatively new to Facebook and with which we did not have significant experience or structure in place to support prior to the acquisition. We continue to make substantial investments of resources to support these acquisitions, which will result in significant ongoing operating expenses and may divert resources and management attention from other areas of our business. We cannot assure you that these investments will be successful. If we fail to successfully integrate the companies we acquire, we may not realize the benefits expected from the transaction and our business may be harmed. If our goodwill or finite-lived intangible assets become impaired, we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings. We review our finite-lived intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable, such as a decline in stock price and market capitalization. We test goodwill for impairment at least annually. If such goodwill or finite-lived intangible assets are deemed to be impaired, an impairment loss equal to the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the assets would be recognized. We may be required to record a significant charge in our financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill or finite-lived intangible assets is determined, which would negatively affect our results of operations. 19 Our business is dependent on our ability to maintain and scale our technical infrastructure, and any significant disruption in our service could damage our reputation, result in a potential loss of users and engagement, and adversely affect our financial results. Our reputation and ability to attract, retain, and serve our users is dependent upon the reliable performance of our products and our underlying technical infrastructure. We have in the past experienced, and may in the future experience, interruptions in the availability or performance of our products from time to time. Our systems may not be adequately designed with the necessary reliability and redundancy to avoid performance delays or outages that could be harmful to our business. If our products are unavailable when users attempt to access them, or if they do not load as quickly as expected, users may not use our products as often in the future, or at all, and our ability to serve ads may be disrupted. As our user base and engagement continue to grow, and the amount and types of information shared on Facebook and our other products continue to grow and evolve, such as increased engagement with video, we will need an increasing amount of technical infrastructure, including network capacity and computing power, to continue to satisfy the needs of our users and advertisers. It is possible that we may fail to continue to effectively scale and grow our technical infrastructure to accommodate these increased demands, which may adversely affect our user engagement and advertising revenue growth. In addition, our business may be subject to interruptions, delays, or failures resulting from earthquakes, adverse weather conditions, other natural disasters, power loss, terrorism, geopolitical conflict, cyber-attacks, or other catastrophic events. If such an event were to occur, users may be subject to service disruptions or outages and we may not be able to recover our technical infrastructure and user data in a timely manner to restart or provide our services, which may adversely affect our financial results. A substantial portion of our network infrastructure is provided by third parties. Any disruption or failure in the services we receive from these providers could harm our ability to handle existing or increased traffic and could significantly harm our business. Any financial or other difficulties these providers face may adversely affect our business, and we exercise little control over these providers, which increases our vulnerability to problems with the services they provide. We could experience unforeseen difficulties in building and operating key portions of our technical infrastructure. We have designed and built our own data centers and key portions of our technical infrastructure through which we serve our products, and we plan to continue to significantly expand the size of our infrastructure primarily through data centers and other projects. The infrastructure expansion we are undertaking is complex and involves projects in multiple locations, and unanticipated delays in the completion of these projects, including due to any shortage of labor necessary in building portions of such projects, or availability of components, may lead to increased project costs, operational inefficiencies, or interruptions in the delivery or degradation of the quality of our products. In addition, there may be issues related to this infrastructure that are not identified during the testing phases of design and implementation, which may only become evident after we have started to fully utilize the underlying equipment, that could further degrade the user experience or increase our costs. Our products and internal systems rely on software that is highly technical, and if it contains undetected errors or vulnerabilities, our business could be adversely affected. Our products and internal systems rely on software, including software developed or maintained internally and/or by third parties, that is highly technical and complex. In addition, our products and internal systems depend on the ability of such software to store, retrieve, process, and manage immense amounts of data. The software on which we rely has contained, and will in the future contain, undetected errors, bugs, or vulnerabilities. Some errors may only be discovered after the code has been released for external or internal use. Errors, vulnerabilities, or other design defects within the software on which we rely have in the past, and may in the future, result in a negative experience for users and marketers who use our products, delay product introductions or enhancements, result in targeting, measurement, or billing errors, compromise our ability to protect the data of our users and/or our intellectual property or lead to reductions in our ability to provide some or all of our services. In addition, any errors, bugs, vulnerabilities, or defects discovered in the software on which we rely, and any associated degradations or interruptions of service, could result in damage to our reputation, loss of users, loss of revenue, or liability for damages, any of which could adversely affect our business and financial results. Technologies have been developed that can block the display of our ads, which could adversely affect our financial results. Technologies have been developed, and will likely continue to be developed, that can block the display of our ads or block our ad measurement tools, particularly for advertising displayed on personal computers. We generate substantially all of our revenue from advertising, including revenue resulting from the display of ads on personal computers. Revenue generated from the display of ads on personal computers has been impacted by these technologies from time to time. As a result, these technologies have had an adverse effect on our financial results and, if such technologies continue to proliferate, in particular with respect to mobile platforms, our future financial results may be harmed. Real or perceived inaccuracies in our user and other metrics may harm our reputation and negatively affect our business. The numbers for our key metrics, which include our DAUs, MAUs, and average revenue per user (ARPU), are calculated using 20 internal company data based on the activity of user accounts. While these numbers are based on what we believe to be reasonable estimates of our user base for the applicable period of measurement, there are inherent challenges in measuring usage of our products across large online and mobile populations around the world. In addition, we are continually seeking to improve our estimates of our user base, and such estimates may change due to improvements or changes in our methodology. We regularly evaluate these metrics to estimate the number of ""duplicate"" and ""false"" accounts among our MAUs. A duplicate account is one that a user maintains in addition to his or her principal account. We divide ""false"" accounts into two categories: (1) user-misclassified accounts, where users have created personal profiles for a business, organization, or non-human entity such as a pet (such entities are permitted on Facebook using a Page rather than a personal profile under our terms of service); and (2) undesirable accounts, which represent user profiles that we determine are intended to be used for purposes that violate our terms of service, such as spamming. The estimates of duplicate and false accounts are based on an internal review of a limited sample of accounts, and we apply significant judgment in making this determination. For example, to identify duplicate accounts we use data signals such as similar IP addresses or user names, and to identify false accounts we look for names that appear to be fake or other behavior that appears inauthentic to the reviewers. Our estimates may change as our methodologies evolve, including through the application of new data signals or technologies, which may allow us to identify previously undetected duplicate or false accounts and may improve our ability to evaluate a broader population of our users. As such, our estimation of duplicate or false accounts may not accurately represent the actual number of such accounts. In particular, duplicate accounts are very difficult to measure at our scale, and it is possible that the actual number of duplicate accounts may vary significantly from our estimates. In the fourth quarter of 2017, we estimate that duplicate accounts may have represented approximately 10% of our worldwide MAUs. We believe the percentage of duplicate accounts is meaningfully higher in developing markets such as India, Indonesia, and the Philippines, as compared to more developed markets. In the fourth quarter of 2017, we estimate that false accounts may have represented approximately 3-4% of our worldwide MAUs. Our estimation of false accounts can vary as a result of episodic spikes in the creation of such accounts, which we have seen originate more frequently in specific countries such as Indonesia, Turkey, and Vietnam. From time to time, we may make product changes or take other actions to reduce the number of duplicate or false accounts among our users, which may also reduce our DAU and MAU estimates in a particular period. Our data limitations may affect our understanding of certain details of our business. For example, while user-provided data indicates a decline in usage among younger users, this age data is unreliable because a disproportionate number of our younger users register with an inaccurate age. Accordingly, our understanding of usage by age group may not be complete. In addition, our data regarding the geographic location of our users is estimated based on a number of factors, such as the user's IP address and self-disclosed location. These factors may not always accurately reflect the user's actual location. For example, a user may appear to be accessing Facebook from the location of the proxy server that the user connects to rather than from the user's actual location. The methodologies used to measure user metrics may also be susceptible to algorithm or other technical errors. Our estimates for revenue by user location and revenue by user device are also affected by these factors. We regularly review our processes for calculating these metrics, and from time to time we may discover inaccuracies in our metrics or make adjustments to improve their accuracy, including adjustments that may result in the recalculation of our historical metrics. We believe that any such inaccuracies or adjustments are immaterial unless otherwise stated. We intend to disclose our estimates of the number of duplicate and false accounts among our MAUs on an annual basis. In addition, our DAU and MAU estimates will differ from estimates published by third parties due to differences in methodology. In addition, from time to time we provide, or rely on, certain other metrics, including those relating to the reach and effectiveness of our ads. All of our metrics are subject to software bugs, inconsistencies in our systems, and human error. If marketers, developers, or investors do not perceive our metrics to be accurate, or if we discover material inaccuracies in our metrics, we may be subject to liability, our reputation may be harmed, and marketers and developers may be less willing to allocate their budgets or resources to Facebook, which could negatively affect our business and financial results. 21 We cannot assure you that we will effectively manage our growth. Our employee headcount and the scope and complexity of our business have increased significantly, with the number of employees increasing to 25,105 as of December 31, 2017 from 17,048 as of December 31, 2016, and we expect such headcount growth to continue for the foreseeable future. The growth and expansion of our business and products create significant challenges for our management, operational, and financial resources, including managing multiple relationships with users, marketers, developers, and other third parties. As our operations and the number of our third-party relationships continue to grow, our information technology systems or our internal controls and procedures may not be adequate to support such growth. In addition, some members of our management do not have significant experience managing a large global business operation, so our management may not be able to manage such growth effectively. To effectively manage our growth, we must continue to improve our operational, financial, and management processes and systems and to effectively expand, train, and manage our employee base. As our organization continues to grow, and we are required to implement more complex organizational management structures, we may find it increasingly difficult to maintain the benefits of our corporate culture, including our ability to quickly develop and launch new and innovative products. This could negatively affect our business performance. The loss of one or more of our key personnel, or our failure to attract and retain other highly qualified personnel in the future, could harm our business. We currently depend on the continued services and performance of our key personnel, including Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl K. Sandberg. Although we have entered into employment agreements with Mr. Zuckerberg and Ms. Sandberg, the agreements have no specific duration and constitute at-will employment. In addition, many of our key technologies and systems are custom-made for our business by our personnel. The loss of key personnel, including members of management as well as key engineering, product development, marketing, and sales personnel, could disrupt our operations and have an adverse effect on our business. As we continue to grow, we cannot guarantee we will continue to attract and retain the personnel we need to maintain our competitive position. In particular, we intend to continue to hire a significant number of technical personnel in the foreseeable future, and we expect to continue to face significant competition from other companies in hiring such personnel, particularly in the San Francisco Bay Area, where our headquarters are located and where the cost of living is high. As we continue to mature, the incentives to attract, retain, and motivate employees provided by our equity awards or by future arrangements may not be as effective as in the past, and if we issue significant equity to attract additional employees or to retain our existing employees, we would incur substantial additional share-based compensation expense and the ownership of our existing stockholders would be further diluted. Our ability to attract, retain, and motivate employees may also be adversely affected by stock price volatility. Additionally, we have a number of current employees whose equity ownership in our company has provided them a substantial amount of personal wealth, which could affect their decisions about whether or not to continue to work for us. As a result of these factors, it may be difficult for us to continue to retain and motivate our employees. If we do not succeed in attracting, hiring, and integrating excellent personnel, or retaining and motivating existing personnel, we may be unable to grow effectively. We may not be able to continue to successfully grow usage of and engagement with mobile and web applications that integrate with Facebook and our other products. We have made and are continuing to make investments to enable developers to build, grow, and monetize mobile and web applications that integrate with Facebook and our other products. Such existing and prospective developers may not be successful in building, growing, or monetizing mobile and/or web applications that create and maintain user engagement. Additionally, developers may choose to build on other platforms, including mobile platforms controlled by third parties, rather than building products that integrate with Facebook and our other products. We are continuously seeking to balance the distribution objectives of our developers with our desire to provide an optimal user experience, and we may not be successful in achieving a balance that continues to attract and retain such developers. For example, from time to time, we have taken actions to reduce the volume of communications from these developers to users on Facebook and our other products with the objective of enhancing the user experience, and such actions have reduced distribution from, user engagement with, and our monetization opportunities from, mobile and web applications integrated with our products. In some instances, these actions, as well as other actions to enforce our policies applicable to developers, have adversely affected our relationships with such developers. If we are not successful in our efforts to continue to grow the number of developers that choose to build products that integrate with Facebook and our other products or if we are unable to continue to build and maintain good relations with such developers, our user growth and user engagement and our financial results may be adversely affected. 22 We currently generate substantially all of our Payments revenue from developers that use Facebook on personal computers, and we expect that our Payments revenue will continue to decline as usage of Facebook on personal computers continues to decline. We currently generate substantially all of our Payments revenue from developers that use Facebook on personal computers. Specifically, applications built by developers of social games are currently responsible for substantially all of our revenue derived from Payments, and the majority of the revenue from these applications has historically been generated by a limited number of the most popular games. We have experienced and expect to see the continued decline in usage of Facebook on personal computers, which we expect will result in a continuing decline in Payments revenue. In addition, only a relatively small percentage of our users have transacted with Facebook Payments. If the Facebook-integrated applications fail to grow or maintain their users and engagement, whether as a result of the continued decline in the usage of Facebook on personal computers or otherwise, if developers do not continue to introduce new applications that attract users and create engagement on Facebook, or if Facebook-integrated applications outside of social games do not gain popularity and generate significant revenue for us, our financial performance could be adversely affected. Payment transactions may subject us to additional regulatory requirements and other risks that could be costly and difficult to comply with or that could harm our business. Our users can purchase virtual and digital goods from developers that offer applications using our Payments infrastructure on the Facebook website. In addition, certain of our users can use our Payments infrastructure, including on Messenger, for other activities, such as sending money to other users and making donations to certain charitable organizations. We are subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the United States, Europe, and elsewhere, including those governing anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing, money transmission, gift cards and other prepaid access instruments, electronic funds transfer, charitable fundraising, and import and export restrictions. Depending on how our Payments product evolves, we may also be subject to other laws and regulations including those governing gambling, banking, and lending. In some jurisdictions, the application or interpretation of these laws and regulations is not clear. To increase flexibility in how our use of Payments may evolve and to mitigate regulatory uncertainty, we have received certain money transmitter licenses in the United States and an Electronic Money (E-Money) license that allows us to conduct certain regulated payment activities in the participating member countries of the European Economic Area, which will generally require us to demonstrate compliance with many domestic and foreign laws in these areas. Our efforts to comply with these laws and regulations could be costly and result in diversion of management time and effort and may still not guarantee compliance. In the event that we are found to be in violation of any such legal or regulatory requirements, we may be subject to monetary fines or other penalties such as a cease and desist order, or we may be required to make product changes, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results. In addition, we may be subject to a variety of additional risks as a result of Payments transactions, including:  increased costs and diversion of management time and effort and other resources to deal with bad transactions or customer disputes;  potential fraudulent or otherwise illegal activity by users, developers, employees, or third parties;  restrictions on the investment of consumer funds used to transact Payments; and  additional disclosure and reporting requirements. We have significant international operations and plan to continue expanding our operations abroad where we have more limited operating experience, and this may subject us to increased business and economic risks that could affect our financial results. We have significant international operations and plan to continue the international expansion of our business operations and the translation of our products. We currently make Facebook available in more than 100 different languages, and we have offices or data centers in more than 30 different countries. We may enter new international markets where we have limited or no experience in marketing, selling, and deploying our products. Our products are generally available globally through the web and on mobile, but some or all of our products or functionality may not be available in certain markets due to legal and regulatory complexities. For example, Facebook and certain of our other products are not generally available in China. We also outsource certain operational functions to third-party vendors globally. If we fail to deploy, manage, or oversee our international operations successfully, our business may suffer. In addition, we are subject to a variety of risks inherent in doing business internationally, including:  political, social, or economic instability;  risks related to legal, regulatory, and other government scrutiny applicable to U.S. companies with sales and operations in foreign jurisdictions, including with respect to privacy, tax, law enforcement, content, trade compliance, intellectual property, and terrestrial infrastructure matters;  potential damage to our brand and reputation due to compliance with local laws, including potential censorship or 23 requirements to provide user information to local authorities;  fluctuations in currency exchange rates and compliance with currency controls;  foreign exchange controls and tax and other regulations and orders that might prevent us from repatriating cash earned in countries outside the United States or otherwise limit our ability to move cash freely, and impede our ability to invest such cash efficiently;  higher levels of credit risk and payment fraud;  enhanced difficulties of integrating any foreign acquisitions;  burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws;  reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries;  difficulties in staffing, managing, and overseeing global operations and the increased travel, infrastructure, and legal compliance costs associated with multiple international locations;  compliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act, and similar laws in other jurisdictions; and  compliance with statutory equity requirements and management of tax consequences. If we are unable to expand internationally and manage the complexity of our global operations successfully, our financial results could be adversely affected. We face design, manufacturing, and supply chain risks that, if not properly managed, could adversely impact our financial results. We face a number of risks related to design, manufacturing, and supply chain management with respect to our Oculus products. For example, the Oculus products we sell may have quality issues resulting from the design or manufacture of the products, or from the software used in the products. Sometimes, these issues may be caused by components we purchase from other manufacturers or suppliers. If the quality of our Oculus products does not meet our customers' expectations or such products are found to be defective, then our brand and financial results could be adversely affected. We rely on third parties to manufacture our Oculus products. We may experience supply shortages or other supply chain disruptions in the future that could result in shipping delays and negatively impact our operations. We could be negatively affected if we are not able to engage third parties with the necessary capabilities or capacity on reasonable terms, or if those we engage with fail to meet their obligations (whether due to financial difficulties or other reasons), or make adverse changes in the pricing or other material terms of such arrangements with them. We also require the suppliers and business partners of our Oculus products to comply with laws and certain company policies regarding sourcing practices and standards on labor, health and safety, the environment, and business ethics, but we do not control them or their practices and standards. If any of them violates laws or implements practices or standards regarded as unethical, corrupt, or non-compliant, we could experience supply chain disruptions, canceled orders, or damage to our reputation. In addition, the SEC's conflict minerals rule requires disclosure by public companies of information relating to the origin, source and chain of custody of specified minerals, known as conflict minerals, that are necessary to the functionality or production of products manufactured or contracted to be manufactured. We may incur significant costs associated with complying with the rule, such as costs related to the determination of the origin, source and chain of custody of the minerals used in Oculus products, the adoption of conflict minerals-related governance policies, processes and controls, and possible changes to products or sources of supply as a result of such activities. We may face inventory risk with respect to our Oculus products. We may be exposed to inventory risks with respect to our Oculus products as a result of rapid changes in product cycles and pricing, unsafe or defective merchandise, changes in consumer demand and consumer spending patterns, changes in consumer tastes with respect to Oculus products, and other factors. We endeavor to accurately predict these trends and avoid overstocking or understocking products Oculus may sell. Demand for products, however, can change significantly between the time inventory or components are ordered and the date of sale. In addition, when we begin selling or manufacturing a new Oculus product, it may be difficult to establish vendor relationships, determine appropriate product or component selection, and accurately forecast demand. The acquisition of certain types of inventory or components may require significant lead-time and prepayment and they may not be returnable. Any one of these factors may adversely affect our operating results. 24 We may have exposure to greater than anticipated tax liabilities. Our income tax obligations are based in part on our corporate operating structure and intercompany arrangements, including the manner in which we operate our business, develop, value, manage, protect, and use our intellectual property and the valuations of our intercompany transactions. We may also be subject to additional indirect or non-income taxes. The tax laws applicable to our business, including the laws of the United States and other jurisdictions, are subject to interpretation and certain jurisdictions are aggressively interpreting their laws in new ways in an effort to raise additional tax revenue from companies such as Facebook. The taxing authorities of the jurisdictions in which we operate may challenge our methodologies for valuing developed technology or intercompany arrangements, which could increase our worldwide effective tax rate and harm our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. For example, in 2016, the IRS issued us a formal assessment relating to transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries in conjunction with the examination of the 2010 tax year, and although we disagree with the IRS's position and are contesting this issue, the ultimate resolution is uncertain and, if resolved in a manner unfavorable to us, may adversely affect our financial results. We are subject to regular review and audit by U.S. federal and state, and foreign tax authorities. Tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken and any adverse outcome of such a review or audit could have a negative effect on our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. In addition, the determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities requires significant judgment by management, and there are many transactions where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Our provision for income taxes is also determined by the manner in which we operate our business, and any changes to such operations or laws applicable to such operations may affect our effective tax rate. Changes in accounting for intercompany transactions may also affect our effective tax rate. For example, with the adoption of Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-16, effective January 1, 2018, the income tax effects of an intercompany transfer will be recognized in the period in which the transfer occurs, rather than amortized over time, which may increase the impact of such transfers on our effective tax rate in a particular period. Although we believe that our provision for income taxes is reasonable, the ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements and may materially affect our financial results in the period or periods for which such determination is made. In addition, our future income tax rates could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions that have lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions that have higher statutory tax rates, by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, or by changes in tax laws, regulations, or accounting principles. For example, we have previously incurred losses in certain international subsidiaries that resulted in an effective tax rate that is significantly higher than the statutory tax rate in the United States and this could continue to happen in the future. Changes in tax laws or tax rulings could materially affect our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. The income and non-income tax regimes we are subject to or operate under are unsettled and may be subject to significant change. Changes in tax laws or tax rulings, or changes in interpretations of existing laws, could materially affect our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. For example, changes to U.S. tax laws enacted in December 2017 had a significant impact on our tax obligations and effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2017. In addition, many countries in Europe, as well as a number of other countries and organizations, have recently proposed or recommended changes to existing tax laws or have enacted new laws that could significantly increase our tax obligations in many countries where we do business or require us to change the manner in which we operate our business. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development has been working on a Base Erosion and Profit Shifting Project, and issued in 2015, and is expected to continue to issue, guidelines and proposals that may change various aspects of the existing framework under which our tax obligations are determined in many of the countries in which we do business. The European Commission has conducted investigations in multiple countries focusing on whether local country tax rulings or tax legislation provides preferential tax treatment that violates European Union state aid rules and concluded that certain countries, including Ireland, have provided illegal state aid in certain cases. These investigations may result in changes to the tax treatment of our foreign operations. Due to the large and expanding scale of our international business activities, many of these types of changes to the taxation of our activities could increase our worldwide effective tax rate and harm our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. Uncertainties in the interpretation and application of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act could materially affect our tax obligations and effective tax rate. The 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act) was enacted on December 22, 2017, and significantly affected U.S. tax law by changing how the U.S. imposes income tax on multinational corporations. The U.S. Department of Treasury has broad authority to issue regulations and interpretative guidance that may significantly impact how we will apply the law and impact our results of operations in the period issued. 25 The Tax Act requires complex computations not previously provided in U.S. tax law. As such, the application of accounting guidance for such items is currently uncertain. Further, compliance with the Tax Act and the accounting for such provisions require accumulation of information not previously required or regularly produced. As a result, we have provided a provisional estimate on the effect of the Tax Act in our financial statements. As additional regulatory guidance is issued by the applicable taxing authorities, as accounting treatment is clarified, as we perform additional analysis on the application of the law, and as we refine estimates in calculating the effect, our final analysis, which will be recorded in the period completed, may be different from our current provisional amounts, which could materially affect our tax obligations and effective tax rate. We cannot guarantee that our share repurchase program will be fully consummated or that it will enhance long-term stockholder value. Share repurchases could also increase the volatility of the trading price of our stock and could diminish our cash reserves. In November 2016, our board of directors authorized a share repurchase program of up to $6.0 billion of our Class A common stock that commenced in 2017 and does not have an expiration date. Although our board of directors has authorized this share repurchase program, the program does not obligate us to repurchase any specific dollar amount or to acquire any specific number of shares. We cannot guarantee that the program will be fully consummated or that it will enhance long-term stockholder value. The program could affect the trading price of our stock and increase volatility, and any announcement of a termination of this program may result in a decrease in the trading price of our stock. In addition, this program could diminish our cash reserves. Risks Related to Ownership of Our Class A Common Stock The trading price of our Class A common stock has been and will likely continue to be volatile. The trading price of our Class A common stock has been, and is likely to continue to be, volatile. Since shares of our Class A common stock were sold in our IPO in May 2012 at a price of $38.00 per share, our stock price has ranged from $17.55 to $184.25 through December 31, 2017. In addition to the factors discussed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the trading price of our Class A common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control, including:  actual or anticipated fluctuations in our revenue and other operating results;  the financial projections we may provide to the public, any changes in these projections or our failure to meet these projections;  actions of securities analysts who initiate or maintain coverage of us, changes in financial estimates by any securities analysts who follow our company, or our failure to meet these estimates or the expectations of investors;  additional shares of our stock being sold into the market by us, our existing stockholders, or in connection with acquisitions, or the anticipation of such sales;  investor sentiment with respect to our competitors, our business partners, and our industry in general;  announcements by us or our competitors of significant products or features, technical innovations, acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures, or capital commitments;  announcements by us or estimates by third parties of actual or anticipated changes in the size of our user base, the level of user engagement, or the effectiveness of our ad products;  changes in operating performance and stock market valuations of technology companies in our industry, including our developers and competitors;  price and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market, including as a result of trends in the economy as a whole;  the inclusion, exclusion, or deletion of our stock from any trading indices, such as the S&P 500 Index;  media coverage of our business and financial performance;  lawsuits threatened or filed against us;  developments in anticipated or new legislation and pending lawsuits or regulatory actions, including interim or final rulings by tax, judicial, or regulatory bodies;  trading activity in our share repurchase program; and  other events or factors, including those resulting from war or incidents of terrorism, or responses to these events. 26 In addition, the stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many technology companies. Stock prices of many technology companies have fluctuated in a manner unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. We are currently subject to securities litigation in connection with our IPO. We may experience more such litigation following future periods of volatility. Any securities litigation could subject us to substantial costs, divert resources and the attention of management from our business, and adversely affect our business. We do not intend to pay cash dividends for the foreseeable future. We have never declared or paid cash dividends on our capital stock. We currently intend to retain any future earnings to finance the operation and expansion of our business, and we do not expect to declare or pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. As a result, you may only receive a return on your investment in our Class A common stock if the trading price of your shares increases. The dual class structure of our common stock and a voting agreement between certain stockholders have the effect of concentrating voting control with our CEO and certain other holders of our Class B common stock; this will limit or preclude your ability to influence corporate matters. Our Class B common stock has ten votes per share and our Class A common stock has one vote per share. Stockholders who hold shares of Class B common stock, including certain of our executive officers, employees, and directors and their affiliates, together hold a substantial majority of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock. Because of the ten-to-one voting ratio between our Class B and Class A common stock, the holders of our Class B common stock collectively control a majority of the combined voting power of our common stock and therefore are able to control all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval so long as the shares of Class B common stock represent at least 9.1% of all outstanding shares of our Class A and Class B common stock. This concentrated control will limit or preclude your ability to influence corporate matters for the foreseeable future. Transfers by holders of Class B common stock will generally result in those shares converting to Class A common stock, subject to limited exceptions, such as certain transfers effected for estate planning or charitable purposes. The conversion of Class B common stock to Class A common stock will have the effect, over time, of increasing the relative voting power of those holders of Class B common stock who retain their shares in the long term. If, for example, Mr. Zuckerberg retains a significant portion of his holdings of Class B common stock for an extended period of time, he could, in the future, continue to control a majority of the combined voting power of our outstanding capital stock. Our status as a ""controlled company"" could make our Class A common stock less attractive to some investors or otherwise harm our stock price. Because we qualify as a ""controlled company"" under the corporate governance rules for Nasdaq-listed companies, we are not required to have a majority of our board of directors be independent, nor are we required to have a compensation committee or an independent nominating function. In light of our status as a controlled company, our board of directors determined not to have a separate and independent nominating function and chose to have the full board of directors be directly responsible for nominating members of our board, and in the future we could elect not to have a majority of our board of directors be independent or not to have a compensation committee. Accordingly, should the interests of our controlling stockholder differ from those of other stockholders, the other stockholders may not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the corporate governance rules for Nasdaq-listed companies. Our status as a controlled company could make our Class A common stock less attractive to some investors or otherwise harm our stock price. Delaware law and provisions in our restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws could make a merger, tender offer, or proxy contest difficult, thereby depressing the trading price of our Class A common stock. Our status as a Delaware corporation and the anti-takeover provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law may discourage, delay, or prevent a change in control by prohibiting us from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years after the person becomes an interested stockholder, even if a change of control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders. In addition, our current restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that may make the acquisition of our company more difficult, including the following:  until the first date on which the outstanding shares of our Class B common stock represent less than 35% of the combined voting power of our common stock, any transaction that would result in a change in control of our company requires the approval of a majority of our outstanding Class B common stock voting as a separate class;  we currently have a dual class common stock structure, which provides Mr. Zuckerberg with the ability to control the outcome of matters requiring stockholder approval, even if he owns significantly less than a majority of the shares of our outstanding Class A and Class B common stock; 27  when the outstanding shares of our Class B common stock represent less than a majority of the combined voting power of common stock, certain amendments to our restated certificate of incorporation or bylaws will require the approval of two-thirds of the combined vote of our then-outstanding shares of Class A and Class B common stock;  when the outstanding shares of our Class B common stock represent less than a majority of the combined voting power of our common stock, vacancies on our board of directors will be able to be filled only by our board of directors and not by stockholders;  when the outstanding shares of our Class B common stock represent less than a majority of the combined voting power of our common stock, our board of directors will be classified into three classes of directors with staggered three-year terms and directors will only be able to be removed from office for cause;  when the outstanding shares of our Class B common stock represent less than a majority of the combined voting power of our common stock, our stockholders will only be able to take action at a meeting of stockholders and not by written consent;  only our chairman, our chief executive officer, our president, or a majority of our board of directors are authorized to call a special meeting of stockholders;  advance notice procedures apply for stockholders to nominate candidates for election as directors or to bring matters before an annual meeting of stockholders;  our restated certificate of incorporation authorizes undesignated preferred stock, the terms of which may be established, and shares of which may be issued, without stockholder approval; and  certain litigation against us can only be brought in Delaware. 28","Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations You should read the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in Part II, Item 8, ""Financial Statements and Supplementary Data"" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition to our historical consolidated financial information, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates, and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, particularly in Part I, Item 1A, ""Risk Factors."" For a discussion of limitations in the measurement of certain of our user metrics, see the section entitled ""Limitations of Key Metrics and Other Data"" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Certain revenue information in the section entitled "" - Revenue - Foreign Exchange Impact on Revenue"" is presented on a constant currency basis. This information is a non-GAAP financial measure. To calculate revenue on a constant currency basis, we translated revenue for the full year 2017 using 2016 monthly exchange rates for our settlement currencies other than the U.S. dollar. This non-GAAP financial measure is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. This measure may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies, limiting its usefulness for comparison purposes. Moreover, presentation of revenue on a constant currency basis is provided for year-over-year comparison purposes, and investors should be cautioned that the effect of changing foreign currency exchange rates has an actual effect on our operating results. We believe this non-GAAP financial measure provides investors with useful supplemental information about the financial performance of our business, enables comparison of financial results between periods where certain items may vary independent of business performance, and allows for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in operating our business. Executive Overview of Full Year 2017 Results Our key user metrics and financial results for 2017 are as follows: User growth:  Daily active users (DAUs) were 1.40 billion on average for December 2017, an increase of 14% year-over-year.  Monthly active users (MAUs) were 2.13 billion as of December 31, 2017, an increase of 14% year-over-year. Financial results:  Revenue was $40.65 billion, up 47% year-over-year, and ad revenue was $39.94 billion, up 49% year-over-year.  Total costs and expenses were $20.45 billion.  Income from operations was $20.20 billion.  Net income was $15.93 billion with diluted earnings per share of $5.39.  Capital expenditures were $6.73 billion.  Effective tax rate was 23%.  Cash and cash equivalents, and marketable securities were $41.71 billion as of December 31, 2017.  Headcount was 25,105 as of December 31, 2017. In 2017, we continued to focus on our three main revenue growth priorities: (i) helping businesses expand their use of our mobile products, (ii) developing innovative ad products that help businesses get the most of their ad campaigns, and (iii) making our ads more relevant and effective through our targeting capabilities and outcome-based measurement. We continued to invest, based on our roadmap, in: (i) our most developed ecosystem, the Facebook app and platform as well as video, (ii) driving growth and building ecosystems around our products and features that already have significant user bases, such as Instagram, Messenger, and WhatsApp, and (iii) long-term technology initiatives, such as connectivity, artificial intelligence, and augmented and virtual reality, that we believe will further our mission to give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together. We intend to continue to invest based on this roadmap and we anticipate that additional investments in the following areas will drive significant year-over-year expense growth in 2018: (i) increased investments in security, video content, and our long-term technology initiatives, and (ii) scaling our headcount and expanding our data center capacity and office facilities to support our growth. 34 Trends in Our User Metrics The numbers for our key metrics, our DAUs, MAUs, and average revenue per user (ARPU), do not include Instagram, WhatsApp, or Oculus users unless they would otherwise qualify as such users, respectively, based on their other activities on Facebook. In addition, other user engagement metrics do not include Instagram, WhatsApp, or Oculus unless otherwise specifically stated. Trends in the number of users affect our revenue and financial results by influencing the number of ads we are able to show, the value of our ads to marketers, the volume of Payments transactions, as well as our expenses and capital expenditures. Substantially all of our daily and monthly active users (as defined below) access Facebook on mobile devices.  Daily Active Users (DAUs). We define a daily active user as a registered Facebook user who logged in and visited Facebook through our website or a mobile device, or used our Messenger application (and is also a registered Facebook user), on a given day. We view DAUs, and DAUs as a percentage of MAUs, as measures of user engagement. Note: For purposes of reporting DAUs, MAUs, and ARPU by geographic region, Europe includes all users in Russia and Turkey and Rest of World includes all users in Africa, Latin America, and the Middle East. 35 Worldwide DAUs increased 14% to 1.40 billion on average during December 2017 from 1.23 billion during December 2016. Users in India, Indonesia, and Brazil represented key sources of growth in DAUs during December 2017, relative to the same period in 2016.  Monthly Active Users (MAUs). We define a monthly active user as a registered Facebook user who logged in and visited Facebook through our website or a mobile device, or used our Messenger application (and is also a registered Facebook user), in the last 30 days as of the date of measurement. MAUs are a measure of the size of our global active user community. As of December 31, 2017, we had 2.13 billion MAUs, an increase of 14% from December 31, 2016. Users in India, Indonesia, and Vietnam represented key sources of growth in 2017, relative to the same period in 2016. 36 Trends in Our Monetization by User Geography We calculate our revenue by user geography based on our estimate of the geography in which ad impressions are delivered, virtual and digital goods are purchased, or virtual reality platform devices are shipped. We define ARPU as our total revenue in a given geography during a given quarter, divided by the average of the number of MAUs in the geography at the beginning and end of the quarter. While ARPU includes all sources of revenue, the number of MAUs used in this calculation only includes users of Facebook and Messenger as described in the definition of MAU above. Revenue from users who are not also Facebook or Messenger MAUs was not material. The geography of our users affects our revenue and financial results because we currently monetize users in different geographies at different average rates. Our revenue and ARPU in regions such as United States & Canada and Europe are relatively higher primarily due to the size and maturity of those online and mobile advertising markets. For example, ARPU in 2017 in the United States & Canada region was more than nine times higher than in the Asia-Pacific region. Note: Our revenue by user geography in the charts above is geographically apportioned based on our estimation of the geographic location of our users when they perform a revenue-generating activity. This allocation differs from our revenue by geography disclosure in our consolidated financial statements where revenue is geographically apportioned based on the location of the marketer or developer. 37 For 2017, worldwide ARPU was $20.21, an increase of 26% from 2016. Over this period, ARPU increased by 41% in Europe, 36% in United States & Canada, 33% in Rest of World, and 22% in Asia-Pacific. In addition, user growth was more rapid in geographies with relatively lower ARPU, such as Asia-Pacific and Rest of World. We expect that user growth in the future will be primarily concentrated in those regions where ARPU is relatively lower, such that worldwide ARPU may continue to increase at a slower rate relative to ARPU in any geographic region, or potentially decrease even if ARPU increases in each geographic region. 38 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, costs and expenses, and related disclosures. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Our estimates are based on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Our actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. An accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made, if different estimates reasonably could have been used, or if changes in the estimate that are reasonably possible could materially impact the financial statements. We believe that the assumptions and estimates associated with income taxes, loss contingencies, and business combinations and valuation of goodwill and other acquired intangible assets have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements. Therefore, we consider these to be our critical accounting policies and estimates. For further information on all of our significant accounting policies, see Note 1  -  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, ""Financial Statements and Supplementary Data"" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Income Taxes We are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes and income tax assets and liabilities, including evaluating uncertainties in the application of accounting principles and complex tax laws. We record a provision for income taxes for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations using the asset and liability method. Under this method, we recognize deferred income tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, as well as for loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the tax rates that are expected to apply to taxable income for the years in which those tax assets and liabilities are expected to be realized or settled. We recognize the deferred income tax effects of a change in tax rates in the period of the enactment. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the net amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized. We recognize tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if we believe that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position. These uncertain tax positions include our estimates for transfer pricing that have been developed based upon analyses of appropriate arms-length prices. Similarly, our estimates related to uncertain tax positions concerning research tax credits are based on an assessment of whether our available documentation corroborating the nature of our activities supporting the tax credits will be sufficient. Although we believe that we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions (including net interest and penalties), we can provide no assurance that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be materially different. We make adjustments to these reserves in accordance with the income tax accounting guidance when facts and circumstances change, such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts recorded, such differences will affect the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made, and could have a material impact on our financial condition and operating results. On December 22, 2017, the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act) was enacted into law and the new legislation contains several key tax provisions that affected us, including a one-time mandatory transition tax on accumulated foreign earnings and a reduction of the corporate income tax rate to 21% effective January 1, 2018, among others. We are required to recognize the effect of the tax law changes in the period of enactment, such as determining the transition tax, remeasuring our U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities as well as reassessing the net realizability of our deferred tax assets and liabilities. In December 2017, the SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118, Income Tax Accounting Implications of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (SAB 118), which allows us to record provisional amounts during a measurement period not to extend beyond one year of the enactment date. Since the Tax Act was passed late in the fourth quarter of 2017, and ongoing guidance and accounting interpretation are expected over the next 12 months, we consider the accounting of the transition tax, deferred tax re-measurements, and other items to be incomplete due to the forthcoming guidance and our ongoing analysis of final year-end data and tax positions. We expect to complete our analysis within the measurement period in accordance with SAB 118. Loss Contingencies We are involved in legal proceedings, claims, and regulatory, tax or government inquiries and investigations that arise in the ordinary course of business. Certain of these matters include speculative claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts of damages. We record a liability when we believe that it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If we determine that a loss is reasonably possible and the loss or range of loss can be estimated, we disclose the possible loss in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements. 39 We review the developments in our contingencies that could affect the amount of the provisions that have been previously recorded, and the matters and related reasonably possible losses disclosed. We make adjustments to our provisions and changes to our disclosures accordingly to reflect the impact of negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel, and updated information. Significant judgment is required to determine both the probability and the estimated amount of loss. The outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. Therefore, if one or more of these matters were resolved against us for amounts in excess of management's expectations, our results of operations and financial condition, including in a particular reporting period in which any such outcome becomes probable and estimable, could be materially adversely affected. See Note 9  -  Commitments and Contingencies and Note 12  -  Income Taxes of the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, ""Financial Statements and Supplementary Data"" and Part I, Item 3, ""Legal Proceedings"" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding these contingencies. Business Combinations and Valuation of Goodwill and Other Acquired Intangible Assets We allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values. The excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. Such valuations require management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets. Significant estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include, but are not limited to, future expected cash flows from acquired users, acquired technology, and trade names from a market participant perspective, useful lives, and discount rates. Management's estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from estimates. During the measurement period, which is not to exceed one year from the acquisition date, we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to earnings. We review goodwill for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances would more likely than not reduce the fair value of our single reporting unit below its carrying value. As of December 31, 2017, no impairment of goodwill has been identified. Acquired finite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives. We evaluate the recoverability of our intangible assets for possible impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. The evaluation is performed at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. Recoverability of these assets is measured by a comparison of the carrying amounts to the future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate. If such review indicates that the carrying amount of property and equipment and intangible assets is not recoverable, the carrying amount of such assets is reduced to fair value. We have not recorded any significant impairment charges during the years presented. In addition to the recoverability assessment, we routinely review the remaining estimated useful lives of our finite-lived intangible assets. If we reduce the estimated useful life assumption for any asset, the remaining unamortized balance would be amortized over the revised estimated useful life. 40 Components of Results of Operations Revenue Advertising. We generate substantially all of our revenue from advertising. Our advertising revenue is generated by displaying ad products on Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and third-party affiliated websites or mobile applications. Marketers pay for ad products either directly or through their relationships with advertising agencies, based on the number of impressions delivered or the number of actions, such as clicks, taken by users. We recognize revenue from the display of impression-based ads in the contracted period in which the impressions are delivered. Impressions are considered delivered when an ad is displayed to a user. We recognize revenue from the delivery of action-based ads in the period in which a user takes the action the marketer contracted for. The number of ads we show is subject to methodological changes as we continue to evolve our ads business and the structure of our ads products. We calculate price per ad as total ad revenue divided by the number of ads delivered, representing the effective price paid per impression by a marketer regardless of their desired objective such as impression or action. For advertising revenue arrangements where we are not the primary obligor, we recognize revenue on a net basis. Payments and other fees. Payments revenue is comprised of the net fee we receive from developers using our Payments infrastructure. Our other fees revenue, which has not been significant in recent periods, consists primarily of revenue from the delivery of virtual reality platform devices, and various other sources. Cost of Revenue and Operating Expenses Cost of revenue. Our cost of revenue consists primarily of expenses associated with the delivery and distribution of our products. These include expenses related to the operation of our data centers, such as facility and server equipment depreciation, salaries, benefits, and share-based compensation for employees on our operations teams, and energy and bandwidth costs. Cost of revenue also includes costs associated with partner arrangements, including content acquisition costs, credit card and other transaction fees related to processing customer transactions, cost of virtual reality platform device inventory sold, and amortization of intangible assets. Research and development. Research and development expenses consist primarily of share-based compensation, salaries, and benefits for employees on our engineering and technical teams who are responsible for building new products as well as improving existing products. We expense all of our research and development costs as they are incurred. Marketing and sales. Our marketing and sales expenses consist of salaries, share-based compensation, and benefits for our employees engaged in sales, sales support, marketing, business development, and customer service functions. Our marketing and sales expenses also include marketing and promotional expenditures, professional services such as content reviewers, as well as amortization of intangible assets. General and administrative. The majority of our general and administrative expenses consist of salaries, benefits, and share-based compensation for certain of our executives as well as our legal, finance, human resources, corporate communications and policy, and other administrative employees. In addition, general and administrative expenses include legal-related costs and professional services. 41 Results of Operations The following tables set forth our consolidated statements of income data: Year Ended December 31,   2017   2016   2015   (in millions) Consolidated Statements of Income Data:           Revenue $ 40,653     $ 27,638     $ 17,928   Costs and expenses:             Cost of revenue 5,454     3,789     2,867   Research and development 7,754     5,919     4,816   Marketing and sales 4,725     3,772     2,725   General and administrative 2,517     1,731     1,295   Total costs and expenses 20,450     15,211     11,703   Income from operations 20,203     12,427     6,225   Interest and other income (expense), net 391     91     (31 ) Income before provision for income taxes 20,594     12,518     6,194   Provision for income taxes 4,660     2,301     2,506   Net income $ 15,934     $ 10,217     $ 3,688 Share-based compensation expense included in costs and expenses: Year Ended December 31,    2017   2016   2015   (in millions) Cost of revenue $ 178     $ 113     $ 81   Research and development 2,820     2,494     2,350   Marketing and sales 436     368     320   General and administrative 289     243     218   Total share-based compensation expense $ 3,723     $ 3,218     $ 2,969 The following tables set forth our consolidated statements of income data (as a percentage of revenue): Year Ended December 31,   2017   2016   2015 Consolidated Statements of Income Data:           Revenue 100 %   100 %   100 % Costs and expenses:           Cost of revenue 13     14     16   Research and development 19     21     27   Marketing and sales 12     14     15   General and administrative 6     6     7   Total costs and expenses 50     55     65   Income from operations 50     45     35   Interest and other income (expense), net 1      -       -    Income before provision for income taxes 51     45     35   Provision for income taxes 11     8     14   Net income 39 %   37 %   21 % 42 Share-based compensation expense included in costs and expenses (as a percentage of revenue): Year Ended December 31,   2017   2016   2015 Cost of revenue  -  %    -  %    -  % Research and development 7     9     13   Marketing and sales 1     1     2   General and administrative 1     1     1   Total share-based compensation expense 9 %   12 %   17 % Revenue Year Ended December 31,   2017 vs 2016 % Change   2016 vs 2015 % Change   2017   2016   2015           (in millions)         Advertising $ 39,942     $ 26,885     $ 17,079     49  %   57  % Payments and other fees 711     753     849     (6 )%   (11 )% Total revenue $ 40,653     $ 27,638     $ 17,928     47  %   54  % 2017 Compared to 2016. Revenue in 2017 increased $13.02 billion, or 47%, compared to 2016. The increase was mostly due to an increase in advertising revenue, partially offset by the continuing decline in Payments revenue. The most important factor driving advertising revenue growth was an increase in revenue from ads on mobile devices. For 2017, we estimate that mobile advertising revenue represented approximately 88% of total advertising revenue, as compared with approximately 83% in 2016. Factors that influenced our advertising revenue growth in 2017 included (i) an increase in average price per ad, (ii) an increase in users and their engagement, and (iii) an increase in the number and frequency of ads displayed on mobile devices. We anticipate that advertising revenue growth will continue to be driven primarily by price rather than increases in the number and frequency of ads displayed. In 2017 compared to 2016, the average price per ad increased by 29%, as compared with approximately 5% in 2016, and the number of ads delivered increased by 15%, as compared with approximately 50% in 2016. The increase in average price per ad was driven by an increase in demand for our ad inventory; factors contributing to this include an increase in spend from existing marketers and an increase in the number of marketers actively advertising on our platform as well as the quality, relevance, and performance of those ads. The increase in the ads delivered was driven by an increase in users and their engagement and an increase in the number and frequency of ads displayed on News Feed, partially offset by increasing user engagement with video content and other product changes. Advertising spending is traditionally seasonally strong in the fourth quarter of each year. We believe that this seasonality in advertising spending affects our quarterly results, which generally reflect significant growth in advertising revenue between the third and fourth quarters and a decline in advertising spending between the fourth and subsequent first quarters. For instance, our advertising revenue increased 26%, 27%, and 31% between the third and fourth quarters of 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively, while advertising revenue for both the first quarters of 2017 and 2016 declined 9% and 8% compared to the fourth quarters of 2016 and 2015, respectively. Payments and other fees revenue in 2017 decreased $42 million, or 6%, compared to 2016. The decline in Payments and other fees revenue was primarily due to decreased Payments revenue from games played on personal computers, partially offset by the revenue from the delivery of virtual reality platform devices. We anticipate Payments revenue will continue to decline, and such decline will be offset by increases in revenue from various other sources. 2016 Compared to 2015. Revenue in 2016 increased $9.71 billion, or 54%, compared to 2015. The increase was mostly due to an increase in advertising revenue. The most important factor driving advertising revenue growth was an increase in revenue from ads in News Feed. For 2016, we estimate that mobile advertising revenue represented approximately 83% of total advertising revenue, as compared with approximately 77% in 2015. Factors that influenced our advertising revenue growth in 2016 included (i) an increase in demand for our ad inventory, in part driven by an increase in the number of marketers actively advertising on Facebook, (ii) an increase in user growth and engagement, and (iii) an increase in the number and frequency of ads displayed in News Feed, as well as the quality, 43 relevance, and performance of those ads. In 2016 compared to 2015, the average price per ad increased by 5% and the number of ads delivered increased by 50%. The increase in average price per ad was driven by a continued mix shift towards a greater percentage of our ads being shown in News Feed while the increase in the ads delivered was driven by the same factors that influenced our advertising growth. Payments and other fees revenue in 2016 decreased $96 million, or 11%, compared to 2015. The majority of the decrease in Payments and other fees revenue was due to decreased Payments revenue from games played on personal computers. No customer represented 10% or more of total revenue during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015. Foreign Exchange Impact on Revenue The general weakening of the U.S. dollar relative to certain foreign currencies in the full year 2017 compared to the same period in 2016 had a favorable impact on our revenue. If we had translated revenue for the full year 2017 using the prior year's monthly exchange rates for our settlement currencies other than the U.S. dollar, our total revenue and advertising revenue would have been $40.36 billion and $39.65 billion, respectively. Using these constant rates, revenue and advertising revenue would have been $293 million and $292 million lower than actual revenue and advertising revenue, respectively, for the full year 2017. The general strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to certain foreign currencies in the full year 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 had an unfavorable impact on our revenue. If we had translated revenue for the full year 2016 using 2015 monthly exchange rates for our settlement currencies other than the U.S. dollar, our total revenue and advertising revenue would have been $27.91 billion and $27.15 billion, respectively. Using these constant rates, revenue and advertising revenue would have been $270 million and $269 million higher than actual revenue and advertising revenue, respectively, for the full year 2016.

Cost of revenue in 2017 increased $1.67 billion, or 44%, compared to 2016. The majority of the increase was due to an increase in operational expenses related to our data centers and technical infrastructure and, to a lesser extent, higher costs associated with partnership agreements, including content acquisition costs, and ads payment processing. 2016 Compared to 2015. Cost of revenue in 2016 increased $922 million, or 32%, compared to 2015. The majority of the increase was due to an increase in operational expenses related to our data centers and technical infrastructure and, to a lesser extent, higher costs associated with ads payment processing and various partnership agreements. In 2018, we anticipate that the cost of revenue will increase as we continue to expand our data center capacity and technical infrastructure to support user growth, increased user engagement, and the delivery of new products and services and, to a lesser extent, due to higher costs associated with ads payment processing and various partnership agreements. Research and development Year Ended December 31,           2017   2016   2015   2017 vs 2016 % Change   2016 vs 2015 % Change   (dollars in millions)         Research and development $ 7,754     $ 5,919     $ 4,816     31 %   23 % Percentage of revenue 19 %   21 %   27 % 2017 Compared to 2016. Research and development expenses in 2017 increased $1.84 billion, or 31%, compared to 2016. The majority of the increase was due to an increase in payroll and benefits as a result of a 49% growth in employee headcount from December 31, 2016 to December 31, 2017 in engineering and other technical functions, partially offset by a $262 million decrease in share-based compensation related to the acquisitions completed in 2014. 44 2016 Compared to 2015. Research and development expenses in 2016 increased $1.10 billion, or 23%, compared to 2015. The majority of the increase was due to an increase in payroll and benefits as a result of a 34% growth in employee headcount from December 31, 2015 to December 31, 2016 in engineering and other technical functions. Additionally, our equipment and related expenses in 2016 to support our research and development efforts increased $170 million compared to 2015. In 2018, we plan to continue to hire software engineers and other technical employees, and to increase our investment to support our research and development initiatives.

Marketing and sales expenses in 2017 increased $953 million, or 25%, compared to 2016. The majority of the increase was due to increases in payroll and benefits expenses as a result of a 35% increase in employee headcount from December 31, 2016 to December 31, 2017 in our marketing and sales functions, and increases in our consulting and other professional service fees. Additionally, our marketing expenses increased $196 million in 2017, compared to 2016. 2016 Compared to 2015. Marketing and sales expenses in 2016 increased $1.05 billion, or 38%, compared to 2015. The majority of the increase was due to payroll and benefits expenses as a result of a 28% increase in employee headcount from December 31, 2015 to December 31, 2016 in our marketing and sales functions, and increases in our consulting and other professional service fees. Additionally, our marketing expenses increased $344 million in 2016, compared to 2015. In 2018, we plan to continue the hiring of marketing and sales employees to support our marketing, sales, and partnership efforts and to increase our investment in security efforts through the hiring of employees and content reviewers.

General and administrative expenses in 2017 increased $786 million, or 45%, compared to 2016. The majority of the increase was due to an increase in payroll and benefits expenses as a result of a 58% increase in employee headcount from December 31, 2016 to December 31, 2017 in general and administrative functions, and to a lesser extent, higher legal-related costs. 2016 Compared to 2015. General and administrative expenses in 2016 increased $436 million, or 34%, compared to 2015. The majority of the increase was due to an increase in payroll and benefits expenses as a result of a 43% increase in employee headcount from December 31, 2015 to December 31, 2016 in general and administrative functions, and to a lesser extent, higher professional services and legal fees. In 2018, we plan to continue to increase general and administrative expenses to support overall company growth. 45 Interest and other income (expense), net Year Ended December 31,           2017   2016   2015   2017 vs 2016 % Change   2016 vs 2015 % Change   (in millions)         Interest income, net $ 392     $ 166     $ 29     136%   NM Other expense, net (1 )   (75 )   (60 )   99%   (25)% Interest and other income (expense), net $ 391     $ 91     $ (31 )   NM   NM 2017 Compared to 2016. Interest and other income, net in 2017 increased $300 million compared to 2016. The majority of the increase in 2017 was due to an increase in interest income driven by higher invested cash balances and interest rates. In addition, foreign exchange impact resulting from the periodic re-measurement of our foreign currency assets and liabilities also contributed to the increase in 2017. 2016 Compared to 2015. Interest and other income (expense), net in 2016 increased $122 million compared to 2015. Interest income, net increased mostly due to increases in interest income driven by higher invested cash balances and interest rates. In addition, the majority of the increase in other expense, net was due to foreign exchange impact resulting from the periodic re-measurement of our foreign currency assets and liabilities. Provision for income taxes Year Ended December 31,           2017   2016   2015   2017 vs 2016 % Change   2016 vs 2015 % Change   (dollars in millions)         Provision for income taxes $ 4,660     $ 2,301     $ 2,506     103 %   (8 )% Effective tax rate 23 %   18 %   40 % 2017 Compared to 2016. Our provision for income taxes in 2017 increased $2.36 billion, or 103%, compared to 2016, mostly due to the effects of the Tax Act that was enacted on December 22, 2017 and an increase in income before provision for income taxes, partially offset by an increase in excess tax benefits recognized from share-based compensation. As a result of the Tax Act, we recognized a one-time mandatory transition tax on accumulated foreign subsidiary earnings, remeasured our U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities, and reassessed the net realizability of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, which increased our provision for income taxes in 2017 by $2.27 billion. Our effective tax rate in 2017 increased compared to 2016, mostly due to the Tax Act and a decrease in the tax rate benefit from share-based compensation compared to 2016. These effects were partially offset by an increase in income before provision for income taxes being earned in jurisdictions with tax rates lower than the U.S. statutory tax rate. In 2017, excess tax benefits recognized from share-based compensation decreased our provision for income taxes by $1.25 billion and our effective tax rate by six percentage points as compared to the tax rate without such benefits. For comparison, in 2016, excess tax benefits recognized from share-based compensation decreased our provision for income taxes by $934 million and our effective tax rate by seven percentage points, as compared to the tax rate without such benefits. 2016 Compared to 2015. Our provision for income taxes in 2016 decreased $205 million, or 8%, compared to 2015, primarily due to recognition of excess tax benefits from share-based compensation in our provision for income taxes resulting from the adoption of ASU 2016-09, partially offset by an increase in income before provision for income taxes. Our effective tax rate in 2016 decreased compared to 2015 due to more of our income before provision for income taxes being earned in jurisdictions with a tax rate lower than the U.S. statutory rate where we had asserted our intention to indefinitely reinvest certain of those earnings, as well as due to a lower increase in our unrecognized tax benefit in 2016 compared to 2015 and the adoption of ASU 2016-09 in 2016. Effective Tax Rate Items. Our effective tax rate in the future will depend upon the proportion of our income before provision for income taxes earned in the United States and in jurisdictions with a tax rate lower than the U.S. statutory rate, as well as a number of other factors, including excess tax benefits from share-based compensation, changes to our provisional accounting for the effects of the Tax Act during the measurement period, tax effects of integrating intellectual property from acquisitions, settlement of tax contingency items, tax effects of changes in our business, and the impact of new legislation. The portion of our income before provision for income taxes earned in jurisdictions with a tax rate lower than the U.S. statutory rate will depend upon the proportion of revenue and costs associated with the respective jurisdictions. 46 Integrating intellectual property from acquisitions into our business generally involves intercompany transactions that have the impact of increasing our provision for income taxes. Consequently, our provision for income taxes and our effective tax rate may initially increase in the period of an acquisition and integration. The magnitude of this impact will depend upon the specific type, size, and taxing jurisdictions of the intellectual property as well as the relative contribution to income in subsequent periods. The accounting for share-based compensation will increase or decrease our effective tax rate based upon the difference between our share-based compensation expense and the deductions taken on our tax return which depends upon the stock price at the time of employee award vesting. Absent unanticipated events and unexpected effects of the Tax Act, we anticipate our effective tax rate in 2018 will be lower than it was in 2017. Our 2017 effective tax rate was significantly affected by the Tax Act. In addition, since we recognize excess tax benefits on a discrete basis, we anticipate that our effective tax rate will vary from quarter to quarter depending on our stock price in each period. If our stock price remains constant to the January 31, 2018 price, we anticipate that our effective tax rate will be lower in the first quarter of 2018 and increase in the remaining quarters throughout the year. Unrecognized Tax Benefits. As of December 31, 2017, we had net unrecognized tax benefits of $2.75 billion which were accrued as other liabilities. These unrecognized tax benefits were predominantly accrued for uncertainties related to transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries, which includes licensing of intellectual property, providing services and other transactions, as well as for uncertainties with our research tax credits. The ultimate settlement of the liabilities will depend upon resolution of tax audits, litigation, or events that would otherwise change the assessment of such items. Based upon the status of litigation described below and the current status of tax audits in various jurisdictions, we do not anticipate a significant impact to such amounts within the next 12 months. In July 2016, we received a Statutory Notice of Deficiency (Notice) from the IRS related to transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries in conjunction with the examination of the 2010 tax year. While the Notice applies only to the 2010 tax year, the IRS states that it will also apply its position for tax years subsequent to 2010, which, if the IRS prevails in its position, could result in an additional federal tax liability of an estimated aggregate amount of approximately $3.0 billion to $5.0 billion in excess of the amounts in our originally filed U.S. return, plus interest and any penalties asserted. We do not agree with the position of the IRS and have filed a petition in the United States Tax Court challenging the Notice. We have previously accrued an estimated unrecognized tax benefit consistent with the guidance in ASC 740 that is lower than the potential additional federal tax liability of $3.0 billion to $5.0 billion in excess of the amounts in our originally filed U.S. return, plus interest and penalties. If the IRS prevails in the assessment of additional tax due based on its position, the assessed tax, interest and penalties, if any, could have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. As of December 31, 2017, we have not resolved this matter and proceedings continue in the United States Tax Court. We believe that adequate amounts have been reserved for any adjustments that may ultimately result from these examinations. We expect to continue to accrue unrecognized tax benefits for certain recurring tax positions and anticipate that the amount for future quarters accrued will be similar to amounts accrued in 2017. Absent unanticipated events, we do not expect our unrecognized tax benefits will have a significant impact on our effective tax rate in 2018. 47 Quarterly Results of Operations Data The following tables set forth our unaudited quarterly consolidated statements of income data in dollars and as a percentage of total revenue for each of the eight quarters in the period ended December 31, 2017. We have prepared the quarterly consolidated statements of income data on a basis consistent with the audited consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, ""Financial Statements and Supplementary Data"" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In the opinion of management, the financial information reflects all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, which we consider necessary for a fair presentation of this data.

Cash and cash equivalents, and marketable securities consist primarily of cash on deposit with banks, investments in money market funds, and investments in U.S. government securities, U.S. government agency securities, and corporate debt securities. Cash and cash equivalents, and marketable securities were $41.71 billion as of December 31, 2017, an increase of $12.26 billion from December 31, 2016, mostly due to $24.22 billion of cash generated from operations, partially offset by $6.73 billion for purchases of property and equipment, $3.25 billion of taxes paid related to net share settlement of equity awards, and $1.98 billion for repurchases of our Class A common stock. Cash paid for income taxes (net of refunds) was $2.12 billion for the year ended December 31, 2017. We recorded a provisional tax liability of $2.9 billion relating to the one-time mandatory transition tax on our accumulated foreign earnings which we intend to pay over an eight-year payment schedule as prescribed by the Tax Act. In May 2016, we entered into a $2.0 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility, and any amounts outstanding under the facility will be due and payable on May 20, 2021. As of December 31, 2017, no amounts had been drawn down and we were in compliance with the covenants under this credit facility. In November 2016, our board of directors authorized a $6.0 billion share repurchase program of our Class A common stock that commenced in 2017 and does not have an expiration date. The timing and actual number of shares repurchased depend on a variety of factors, including price, general business and market conditions, and other investment opportunities, and shares may be repurchased through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions, including through the use of trading plans intended to qualify under Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. During 2017, we repurchased and subsequently retired approximately 13 million shares of our Class A common stock for an aggregate amount of approximately $2.07 billion. In January 2017, we began funding withholding taxes due on employee equity awards by net share settlement, rather than our previous approach of requiring employees to sell shares of our common stock to cover taxes upon vesting of such awards. In 2017, we paid $3.25 billion of taxes related to the net share settlement of equity awards. As of December 31, 2017, $15.89 billion of the $41.71 billion in cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities was held by our foreign subsidiaries. The Tax Act imposes a mandatory transition tax on accumulated foreign earnings and eliminates U.S. taxes on foreign subsidiary distributions. As a result, earnings in foreign jurisdictions are available for distribution to the U.S. without incremental U.S. taxes. We currently anticipate that our available funds, credit facility, and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our operational cash needs for the foreseeable future. Cash Provided by Operating Activities Cash flow from operating activities during 2017 mostly consisted of net income, adjusted for certain non-cash items, such as share-based compensation expense of $3.72 billion and total depreciation and amortization of $3.03 billion. The increase in cash flow from operating activities during 2017 compared to 2016, was mostly due to an increase in net income, adjusted for certain non-cash items, such as depreciation and amortization and share-based compensation expense. Due to the enactment of the Tax Act in 2017, we recorded a provisional tax liability of $2.9 billion relating to the one-time mandatory transition tax on our accumulated foreign earnings,which also contributed to the increase in 2017 compared to 2016. 50 Cash flow from operating activities during 2016 mostly consisted of net income, adjusted for certain non-cash items, such as share-based compensation expense of $3.22 billion and total depreciation and amortization of $2.34 billion. The increase in cash flow from operating activities during 2016 compared to 2015, was mostly due to an increase in net income, including the impact of ASU 2016-09 adoption, as adjusted for depreciation and amortization, deferred income taxes, and share-based compensation expense. Cash flow from operating activities during 2015 mostly consisted of net income, adjusted for certain non-cash items, such as share-based compensation expense of $2.96 billion, total depreciation and amortization of $1.95 billion, and tax benefit from share-based award activity of $1.72 billion, which had been reclassified from financing activity as a result of ASU 2016-09 adoption. The increase in cash flow from operating activities during 2015 compared to 2014, was primarily due to an increase in net income, as adjusted for share-based compensation expense, and higher income tax payable as of December 31, 2015 compared to 2014. Cash Used in Investing Activities Cash used in investing activities during 2017 mostly resulted from $13.25 billion for net purchases of marketable securities and $6.73 billion for capital expenditures as we continued to invest in servers, data centers, office buildings, and network infrastructure. The increase in cash used in investing activities during 2017 compared to 2016 was due to increases in net purchases of marketable securities and capital expenditures. Cash used in investing activities during 2016 mostly resulted from $7.19 billion for net purchases of marketable securities and $4.49 billion for capital expenditures as we continued to invest in data centers, servers, office buildings, and network infrastructure. The increase in cash used in investing activities during 2016 compared to 2015 was mostly due to increases in capital expenditures and net purchases of marketable securities. Cash used in investing activities during 2015 primarily resulted from $6.70 billion for net purchases of marketable securities and $2.52 billion for capital expenditures as we continued to invest in servers, data centers, network infrastructure, and office buildings. The increase in cash used in investing activities during 2015 compared to 2014 was mainly due to increases in net purchases of marketable securities, partially offset by a decrease in acquisitions of businesses and purchases of intangible assets. We anticipate making capital expenditures in 2018 of approximately $14.0 billion to $15.0 billion. Cash Used in Financing Activities Cash used in financing activities during 2017 mostly consisted of $3.25 billion of taxes paid related to net share settlement of equity awards, and $1.98 billion paid for repurchases of our Class A common stock. The increase in cash used in financing activities during 2017 compared to 2016 was mostly due to taxes paid related to net share settlement of equity awards and repurchases of our Class A common stock that commenced in 2017. Cash used in financing activities during 2016 mostly consisted of principal payments on capital lease and other financing obligations. The increase in cash used in financing activities was due to full repayment of our capital lease and other financing obligations in 2016. Cash used in financing activities during 2015 primarily consisted of principal payments on capital lease obligations. The decrease in cash used in financing activities was primarily due to lower principal payments related to our capital lease transactions. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as of December 31, 2017. 51 Contractual Obligations Our principal commitments consist of obligations under operating leases for offices, land, facilities, colocations, and data centers, as well as contractual commitments related to network infrastructure and data center operations. The following table summarizes our commitments to settle contractual obligations in cash as of December 31, 2017 (in millions): Payment Due by Period    Total   Less than  1 Year   1-3  Years   3-5  Years   More than  5 Years Operating lease obligations $ 4,644     $ 409     $ 934     $ 878     $ 2,423   Financing obligation - building in progress - leased facility(1) 195      -      16     30     149   Other contractual commitments(2) 2,953     1,830     346     100     677   Total contractual obligations $ 7,792     $ 2,239     $ 1,296     $ 1,008     $ 3,249 (1) Financing obligation - building in progress - leased facility represents our commitments to lease certain office buildings that are currently under construction. As of December 31, 2017, $72 million of the total obligation was recorded as a liability and is included in other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. See Note 9 of the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements for additional information related to this financing obligation. (2) Other contractual commitments primarily relate to network infrastructure and our data center operations. As part of the normal course of the business, we may enter into multi-year agreements to purchase certain network components that do not specify a fixed or minimum price commitment or to purchase renewable energy that do not specify a fixed or minimum volume commitment. These agreements are generally entered into in order to secure either volume or price. Using projected market prices or expected volume consumption, the total estimated spend is approximately $4.0 billion. The ultimate spend under these agreements may vary and will be based on prevailing market prices or actual volume purchased. In addition, our other liabilities include $2.75 billion related to uncertain tax positions as of December 31, 2017. Due to uncertainties in the timing of the completion of tax audits, the timing of the resolution of these positions is uncertain and we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years beyond 12 months. As a result, this amount is not included in the above contractual obligations table. Contingencies We are involved in legal proceedings, claims, and regulatory, tax or government inquiries and investigations. We record a provision for a liability when we believe that it is both probable that a liability has been incurred, and that the amount can be reasonably estimated. If we determine that a loss is reasonably possible and the loss or range of loss can be estimated, we disclose the possible loss in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements. Significant judgment is required to determine both probability and the estimated amount of loss. Such matters are inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control. Should any of these estimates and assumptions change or prove to be incorrect, it could have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows. See Note 9  -  Commitments and Contingencies and Note 12  -  Income Taxes of the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, ""Financial Statements and Supplementary Data"" and Part I, Item 3, ""Legal Proceedings"" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding these contingencies. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) (ASU 2014-09), which amends the existing accounting standards for revenue recognition. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date, which delays the effective date of ASU 2014-09 by one year. The FASB also agreed to allow entities to choose to adopt the standard as of the original effective date. In March 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-08, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net) (ASU 2016-08) which clarifies the implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations. The guidance includes indicators to assist an entity in determining whether it controls a specified good or service before it is transferred to the customers. The new standard further requires new disclosures about contracts with customers, including the significant judgments the company has made when applying the guidance. We will adopt the new standard effective January 1, 2018, using the modified retrospective transition method. We finalized our analysis and the adoption of this guidance will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and our internal controls over financial reporting. In February 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) (ASU 2016-02), which generally requires companies to recognize operating and financing lease liabilities and corresponding right-of-use assets on the balance sheet. This 52 guidance will be effective for us in the first quarter of 2019 on a modified retrospective basis and early adoption is permitted. We will adopt the new standard effective January 1, 2019. We have selected a lease accounting system and we are in the process of implementing such system as well as evaluating the use of the optional practical expedients. While we continue to evaluate the effect of adopting this guidance on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures, we expect our operating leases, as disclosed in Note 9  -  Commitments and Contingencies in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, ""Financial Statements and Supplementary Data"" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, will be subject to the new standard. We will recognize right-of-use assets and operating lease liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets upon adoption, which will increase our total assets and liabilities. In October 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-16, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Intra-Entity Transfers Other than Inventory (ASU 2016-16), which requires companies to recognize the income-tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset other than inventory when the transfer occurs, rather than when the asset has been sold to an outside party. We will adopt the new standard effective January 1, 2018, using the modified retrospective transition approach through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the effective date. A cumulative-effect adjustment will capture the write-off of income tax consequences deferred from past intra-entity transfers involving assets other than inventory, new deferred tax assets, and other liabilities for amounts not currently recognized under U.S. GAAP. Based on transactions up to December 31, 2017, we do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. In November 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-18, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Restricted Cash (ASU 2016-18), which requires companies to include amounts generally described as restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents in cash and cash equivalents when reconciling beginning-of-period and end-of-period total amounts shown on the statement of cash flows. We will adopt the new standard effective January 1, 2018, using the retrospective transition approach for all periods presented. We do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. In January 2017, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2017-01, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Clarifying the Definition of a Business (ASU 2017-01), which revises the definition of a business and provides new guidance in evaluating when a set of transferred assets and activities is a business. We will adopt the new standard effective January 1, 2018, on a prospective basis and do not expect the standard to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. In January 2017, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2017-04, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment (ASU 2017-04), which eliminates step two from the goodwill impairment test. Under ASU 2017-04, an entity should recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value up to the amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. This guidance will be effective for us in the first quarter of 2020 on a prospective basis, and early adoption is permitted. We do not expect the standard to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. 53","Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We are exposed to market risks, including changes to foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, and inflation. Foreign Currency Exchange Risk We have foreign currency risks related to our revenue and operating expenses denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, primarily the Euro. In general, we are a net receiver of currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Accordingly, changes in exchange rates, and in particular a strengthening of the U.S. dollar, have in the past, and may in the future, negatively affect our revenue and other operating results as expressed in U.S. dollars. We have experienced and will continue to experience fluctuations in our net income as a result of transaction gains or losses related to revaluing certain current asset and current liability balances that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the entities in which they are recorded. At this time we have not entered into, but in the future we may enter into, derivatives or other financial instruments in an attempt to hedge our foreign currency exchange risk. It is difficult to predict the effect hedging activities would have on our results of operations. We recognized foreign currency losses of $6 million, $76 million, and $66 million in 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. Interest Rate Sensitivity Our exposure to changes in interest rates relates primarily to interest earned and market value on our cash and cash equivalents, and marketable securities. Our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities consist of cash, certificates of deposit, time deposits, money market funds, U.S. government securities, U.S. government agency securities, and corporate debt securities. Our investment policy and strategy are focused on preservation of capital and supporting our liquidity requirements. Changes in U.S. interest rates affect the interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities, and the market value of those securities. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would have resulted in a decrease of $611 million and $403 million in the market value of our available-for-sale debt securities as of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively. Any realized gains or losses resulting from such interest rate changes would only occur if we sold the investments prior to maturity. 54","Item 8.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Stockholders and Board of Directors of Facebook, Inc. Opinion on the Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Facebook, Inc. (the Company) as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2017, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the ""financial statements""). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of the Company at December 31, 2017 and 2016, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2017, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017, based on criteria established in Internal Control  -  Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated February 1, 2018 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. /s/ Ernst & Young LLP We have served as the Company's auditor since 2007. San Francisco, California February 1, 2018 56 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Stockholders and Board of Directors of Facebook, Inc. Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting We have audited Facebook, Inc.'s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017, based on criteria established in Internal Control  -  Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Facebook, Inc. (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017, based on the COSO criteria. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Facebook, Inc. as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2017 of the Company and our report dated February 1, 2018 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. Basis for Opinion The Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/ Ernst & Young LLP San Francisco, California February 1, 2018 57 FACEBOOK, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Organization and Description of Business Facebook was incorporated in Delaware in July 2004. Our mission is to give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together. We generate substantially all of our revenue from advertising. Basis of Presentation We prepared the consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Facebook, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. Use of Estimates Conformity with GAAP requires the use of estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. These estimates form the basis for judgments we make about the carrying values of our assets and liabilities, which are not readily apparent from other sources. We base our estimates and judgments on historical information and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. GAAP requires us to make estimates and judgments in several areas, including, but not limited to, those related to revenue recognition, collectability of accounts receivable, commitments and contingencies, fair value of financial instruments, fair value of acquired intangible assets and goodwill, useful lives of intangible assets and property and equipment, leases, and income taxes. These estimates are based on management's knowledge about current events and expectations about actions we may undertake in the future. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. Revenue Recognition We recognize revenue once all of the following criteria have been met:  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists;  delivery of our obligations to our customer has occurred;  the price is fixed or determinable; and  collectability of the related receivable is reasonably assured. Revenue for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015 consists of the following (in millions): Year Ended December 31,   2017   2016   2015 Advertising $ 39,942     $ 26,885     $ 17,079   Payments and other fees 711     753     849   Total revenue $ 40,653     $ 27,638     $ 17,928 Advertising Advertising revenue is generated by displaying ad products on Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and third-party affiliated websites or mobile applications. The arrangements are evidenced by either online acceptance of terms and conditions or contracts that stipulate the types of advertising to be delivered, the timing and the pricing. Marketers pay for ad products either directly or through their relationships with advertising agencies, based on the number of impressions delivered or the number of actions, such as clicks, taken by our users. We recognize revenue from the display of impression-based ads in the contracted period in which the impressions are delivered. Impressions are considered delivered when an ad is displayed to users. We recognize revenue from the delivery of action-based ads in the period in which a user takes the action the marketer contracted for. For advertising revenue arrangements where we are not the primary obligor, we recognize revenue on a net basis. Payments and Other Fees Payments revenue is comprised of the net fee we receive from developers using our Payments infrastructure. 64 Other fees revenue, which was not material for all periods presented in our financial statements, consists primarily of revenue from the delivery of virtual reality platform devices and various other sources. Revenue is recognized net of applicable sales and other taxes. Cost of Revenue Our cost of revenue consists primarily of expenses associated with the delivery and distribution of our products. These include expenses related to the operation of our data centers, such as facility and server equipment depreciation, salaries, benefits, and share-based compensation for employees on our operations teams, and energy and bandwidth costs. Cost of revenue also includes costs associated with partner arrangements, including content acquisition costs, credit card and other transaction fees related to processing customer transactions, cost of virtual reality platform device inventory sold, and amortization of intangible assets. Content acquisition costs We license and pay to produce content in order to increase engagement on the platform. For licensed content, we capitalize the fee per title and record a corresponding liability at the gross amount of the liability when the license period begins, the cost of the title is known and the title is accepted and available for viewing. The amounts capitalized are limited to estimated net realizable value or fair value on a per title basis. The portion available for viewing within one year is recognized as prepaid expenses and other current assets and the remaining portion as other assets on the consolidated balance sheets. For original programming, we capitalize costs associated with the production, including development costs and direct costs, if those amounts are recoverable. Capitalized original programming costs are included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets. Capitalized costs are amortized in cost of revenue on the consolidated statements of income based on historical and estimated viewing patterns. Capitalized content costs are reviewed when an event or change in circumstances indicates a change in the expected usefulness of the content or that the fair value may be less than amortized cost. If such changes are identified, capitalized content assets will be stated at the lower of unamortized cost, net realizable value or fair value. In addition, unamortized costs for assets that have been, or are expected to be, abandoned are written off. Capitalized content acquisition costs have not been material to date. Income Taxes We record provision for income taxes for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations using the asset and liability method. Under this method, we recognize deferred income tax assets and liabilities for the expected future consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, as well as for loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the tax rates that are expected to apply to taxable income for the years in which those tax assets and liabilities are expected to be realized or settled. We recognize the deferred income tax effects of a change in tax rates in the period of the enactment. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the net amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized. We consider all available evidence, both positive and negative, including historical levels of income, expectations and risks associated with estimates of future taxable income and ongoing tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance. We recognize tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if we believe that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position. These uncertain tax positions include our estimates for transfer pricing that have been developed based upon analyses of appropriate arms-length prices. Similarly, our estimates related to uncertain tax positions concerning research tax credits are based on an assessment of whether our available documentation corroborating the nature of our activities supporting the tax credits will be sufficient. Although we believe that we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions (including net interest and penalties), we can provide no assurance that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be materially different. We make adjustments to these reserves when facts and circumstances change, such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts recorded, such differences will affect the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made and could have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. On December 22, 2017, the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act) was enacted into law and the new legislation contains several key tax provisions that affected us, including a one-time mandatory transition tax on accumulated foreign earnings and a reduction of the corporate income tax rate to 21% effective January 1, 2018, among others. We are required to recognize the effect of the tax law changes in the period of enactment, such as determining the transition tax, re-measuring our U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities as well as reassessing the net realizability of our deferred tax assets and liabilities. In December 2017, the SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118, Income Tax Accounting Implications of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (SAB 118), which allows us to record provisional amounts during a measurement period not to extend beyond one year of the enactment date. Since the Tax Act was passed late in the 65 fourth quarter of 2017, and ongoing guidance and accounting interpretation is expected over the next 12 months, we consider the accounting of the transition tax, deferred tax re-measurements, and other items to be incomplete due to the forthcoming guidance and our ongoing analysis of final year-end data and tax positions. We expect to complete our analysis within the measurement period in accordance with SAB 118. See Note 12 in these notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. Advertising Expense Advertising costs are expensed when incurred and are included in marketing and sales expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of income. We incurred advertising expenses of $324 million, $310 million, and $281 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. Cash and Cash Equivalents, and Marketable Securities Cash and cash equivalents primarily consist of cash on deposit with banks and investments in money market funds with maturities of 90 days or less from the date of purchase. We hold investments in marketable securities, consisting of U.S. government securities, U.S. government agency securities, and corporate debt securities. We classify our marketable securities as available-for-sale investments in our current assets because they represent investments of cash available for current operations. Our available-for-sale investments are carried at estimated fair value with any unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, included in accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income in stockholders' equity. Unrealized losses are charged against interest and other income (expense), net when a decline in fair value is determined to be other-than-temporary. We have not recorded any such impairment charge in the periods presented. We determine realized gains or losses on sale of marketable securities on a specific identification method, and record such gains or losses as interest and other income (expense), net. We classify certain restricted cash balances within prepaid expenses and other current assets and other assets on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets based upon the term of the remaining restrictions. Fair Value of Financial Instruments We apply fair value accounting for all financial assets and liabilities and non-financial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis. We define fair value as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. When determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities, which are required to be recorded at fair value, we consider the principal or most advantageous market in which we would transact and the market-based risk measurements or assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, such as risks inherent in valuation techniques, transfer restrictions and credit risk. Fair value is estimated by applying the following hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value into three levels and bases the categorization within the hierarchy upon the lowest level of input that is available and significant to the fair value measurement: Level 1-Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2-Observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. Level 3-Inputs that are generally unobservable and typically reflect management's estimate of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. Our valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of money market funds and marketable debt securities were derived from quoted market prices or alternative pricing sources and models utilizing market observable inputs. Our valuation technique used to measure the fair value of our contingent consideration liability as of December 31, 2016 was derived from the fair value of our common stock on such date. We settled this contingent consideration liability in July 2017. Accounts Receivable and Allowances Accounts receivable are recorded and carried at the original invoiced amount less an allowance for any potential uncollectible amounts. We make estimates for the allowance for doubtful accounts and allowance for unbilled receivables based upon our assessment of various factors, including historical experience, the age of the accounts receivable balances, credit quality of our customers, current economic conditions, and other factors that may affect our ability to collect from customers. 66 Property and Equipment Property and equipment, which includes amounts recorded under capital leases, are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets or the remaining lease term, whichever is shorter. The estimated useful lives of property and equipment are described below: Property and Equipment    Useful Life  Network equipment   Three to 20 years Buildings   Three to 30 years Computer software, office equipment and other   Two to five years Leased equipment and leasehold improvements   Lesser of estimated useful life or remaining lease term Land and assets held within construction in progress are not depreciated. Construction in progress is related to the construction or development of property and equipment that have not yet been placed in service for their intended use. The cost of maintenance and repairs is expensed as incurred. When assets are retired or otherwise disposed of, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from their respective accounts, and any gain or loss on such sale or disposal is reflected in income from operations. Lease Obligations We enter into lease arrangements for office space, land, facilities, data centers, and equipment under non-cancelable capital and operating leases. Certain of the operating lease agreements contain rent holidays, rent escalation provisions, and purchase options. Rent holidays and rent escalation provisions are considered in determining the straight-line rent expense to be recorded over the lease term. The lease term begins on the date of initial possession of the leased property for purposes of recognizing lease expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. We do not assume renewals in our determination of the lease term unless the renewals are deemed to be reasonably assured at lease inception. We record assets and liabilities for the estimated construction costs incurred by third parties under build-to-suit lease arrangements to the extent that we are involved in the construction of structural improvements or bear construction risk prior to commencement of a lease. Loss Contingencies We are involved in legal proceedings, claims, and regulatory, tax or government inquiries and investigations that arise in the ordinary course of business. Certain of these matters include speculative claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts of damages. We record a liability when we believe that it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If we determine that a loss is reasonably possible and the loss or range of loss can be estimated, we disclose the possible loss in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. We review the developments in our contingencies that could affect the amount of the provisions that has been previously recorded, and the matters and related possible losses disclosed. We make adjustments to our provisions and changes to our disclosures accordingly to reflect the impact of negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel, and updated information. Significant judgment is required to determine both the probability and the estimated amount. Business Combinations We allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed and intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values. The excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. Such valuations require management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets. Significant estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include, but are not limited to, future expected cash flows from acquired users, acquired technology, and trade names from a market participant perspective, useful lives and discount rates. Management's estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from estimates. During the measurement period, which is not to exceed one year from the acquisition date, we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to earnings. 67 Long-Lived Assets, Including Goodwill and Other Acquired Intangible Assets We evaluate the recoverability of property and equipment and finite-lived intangible assets for possible impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. The evaluation is performed at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. Recoverability of these assets is measured by a comparison of the carrying amounts to the future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate. If such review indicates that the carrying amount of property and equipment and intangible assets is not recoverable, the carrying amount of such assets is reduced to fair value. We have not recorded any significant impairment charges during the years presented. We review goodwill for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances would more likely than not reduce the fair value of our single reporting unit below its carrying value. As of December 31, 2017, no impairment of goodwill has been identified. Acquired finite-lived intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets. We routinely review the remaining estimated useful lives of property and equipment and finite-lived intangible assets. If we reduce the estimated useful life assumption for any asset, the remaining unamortized balance is amortized or depreciated over the revised estimated useful life. Deferred Revenue and Deposits Deferred revenue consists of billings and payments from marketers in advance of revenue recognition. Deposits relate to unused balances held on behalf of our users. Once this balance is utilized by a user, approximately 70% of this amount would then be payable to the developer and the balance would be recognized as revenue. Deferred revenue and deposits consists of the following (in millions): December 31,    2017   2016 Deferred revenue $ 68     $ 62   Deposits 30     28   Total deferred revenue and deposits $ 98     $ 90 Foreign Currency Generally the functional currency of our international subsidiaries is the local currency. We translate the financial statements of these subsidiaries to U.S. dollars using month-end rates of exchange for assets and liabilities, and average rates of exchange for revenue, costs, and expenses. Translation gains and losses are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income as a component of stockholders' equity. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, we had a cumulative translation loss, net of tax of $16 million and $582 million, respectively. Net losses resulting from foreign exchange transactions were $6 million, $76 million, and $66 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. These losses were recorded as interest and other income (expense), net in our consolidated statements of income. Credit Risk and Concentration Our financial instruments that are potentially subject to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, marketable securities, and accounts receivable. The majority of cash equivalents consists of short-term money market funds, which are managed by reputable financial institutions. Marketable securities consist of investments in U.S. government securities, U.S. government agency securities, and corporate debt securities. Our investment policy limits investment instruments to U.S. government securities, U.S. government agency securities, and corporate debt securities with the main objective of preserving capital and maintaining liquidity. Accounts receivable are typically unsecured and are derived from revenue earned from customers across different industries and countries. We generated 44%, 46%, and 47% of our revenue for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively, from marketers and developers based in the United States, with the majority of revenue outside of the United States coming from customers located in western Europe, China, Canada, Australia, and Brazil. We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers, and generally do not require collateral. We maintain an allowance for estimated credit losses. During the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, our bad debt expenses were $48 million, $66 million, and $44 million, respectively. In the event that accounts receivable collection cycles deteriorate, our operating results and financial position could be adversely affected. 68 No customer represented 10% or more of total revenue during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015. Segments Our chief operating decision-maker is our Chief Executive Officer who makes resource allocation decisions and assesses performance based on financial information presented on a consolidated basis. There are no segment managers who are held accountable by the chief operating decision-maker, or anyone else, for operations, operating results, and planning for levels or components below the consolidated unit level. Accordingly, we have determined that we have a single reportable segment and operating segment structure. Recent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) (ASU 2014-09), which amends the existing accounting standards for revenue recognition. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date, which delays the effective date of ASU 2014-09 by one year. The FASB also agreed to allow entities to choose to adopt the standard as of the original effective date. In March 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-08, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net) (ASU 2016-08) which clarifies the implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations. The guidance includes indicators to assist an entity in determining whether it controls a specified good or service before it is transferred to the customers. The new standard further requires new disclosures about contracts with customers, including the significant judgments the company has made when applying the guidance. We will adopt the new standard effective January 1, 2018, using the modified retrospective transition method. We finalized our analysis and the adoption of this guidance will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and our internal controls over financial reporting. In February 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) (ASU 2016-02), which generally requires companies to recognize operating and financing lease liabilities and corresponding right-of-use assets on the balance sheet. This guidance will be effective for us in the first quarter of 2019 on a modified retrospective basis and early adoption is permitted. We will adopt the new standard effective January 1, 2019. We have selected a lease accounting system and we are in the process of implementing such system as well as evaluating the use of the optional practical expedients. While we continue to evaluate the effect of adopting this guidance on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures, we expect our operating leases, as disclosed in Note 9  -  Commitments and Contingencies, will be subject to the new standard. We will recognize right-of-use assets and operating lease liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets upon adoption, which will increase our total assets and liabilities. In October 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-16, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Intra-Entity Transfers Other than Inventory (ASU 2016-16), which requires companies to recognize the income-tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset other than inventory when the transfer occurs, rather than when the asset has been sold to an outside party. We will adopt the new standard effective January 1, 2018, using the modified retrospective transition approach through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the effective date. A cumulative-effect adjustment will capture the write-off of income tax consequences deferred from past intra-entity transfers involving assets other than inventory, new deferred tax assets, and other liabilities for amounts not currently recognized under U.S. GAAP. Based on transactions up to December 31, 2017, we do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. In November 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-18, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Restricted Cash (ASU 2016-18), which requires companies to include amounts generally described as restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents in cash and cash equivalents when reconciling beginning-of-period and end-of-period total amounts shown on the statement of cash flows. We will adopt the new standard effective January 1, 2018, using the retrospective transition approach for all periods presented. We do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. In January 2017, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2017-01, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Clarifying the Definition of a Business (ASU 2017-01), which revises the definition of a business and provides new guidance in evaluating when a set of transferred assets and activities is a business. We will adopt the new standard effective January 1, 2018, on a prospective basis and do not expect the standard to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. In January 2017, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2017-04, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment (ASU 2017-04), which eliminates step two from the goodwill impairment test. Under ASU 2017-04, an entity should recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value up to the amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. This guidance will be effective for us in the first quarter of 2020 on a prospective basis, and early adoption is permitted. We do not expect the standard to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. Note 2. Earnings per Share We compute earnings per share (EPS) of Class A and Class B common stock using the two-class method required for participating 69 securities. We consider restricted stock awards to be participating securities because holders of such shares have non-forfeitable dividend rights in the event of our declaration of a dividend for common shares. Undistributed earnings allocated to participating securities are subtracted from net income in determining net income attributable to common stockholders. Basic EPS is computed by dividing net income attributable to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of shares of our Class A and Class B common stock outstanding, adjusted for outstanding shares that are subject to repurchase. For the calculation of diluted EPS, net income attributable to common stockholders for basic EPS is adjusted by the effect of dilutive securities, such as awards under our equity compensation plans and inducement awards under separate non-plan restricted stock unit (RSU) award agreements. In addition, the computation of the diluted EPS of Class A common stock assumes the conversion of our Class B common stock to Class A common stock, while the diluted EPS of Class B common stock does not assume the conversion of those shares to Class A common stock. Diluted EPS attributable to common stockholders is computed by dividing the resulting net income attributable to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of fully diluted common shares outstanding. RSUs with anti-dilutive effect were excluded from the EPS calculation and they were not material for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. Basic and diluted EPS are the same for each class of common stock because they are entitled to the same liquidation and dividend rights. 70 The numerators and denominators of the basic and diluted EPS computations for our common stock are calculated as follows (in millions, except per share amounts): Year Ended December 31,   2017   2016   2015   Class A   Class B   Class A   Class B   Class A   Class B  Basic EPS:                       Numerator                       Net income $ 13,034     $ 2,900     $ 8,270     $ 1,947     $ 2,959     $ 729   Less: Net income attributable to participating securities 12     2     24     5     15     4   Net income attributable to common stockholders $ 13,022     $ 2,898     $ 8,246     $ 1,942     $ 2,944     $ 725   Denominator                       Weighted average shares outstanding 2,375     528     2,323     548     2,259     559   Less: Shares subject to repurchase 2      -      6     2     10     5   Number of shares used for basic EPS computation 2,373     528     2,317     546     2,249     554   Basic EPS $ 5.49     $ 5.49     $ 3.56     $ 3.56     $ 1.31     $ 1.31   Diluted EPS:                       Numerator                       Net income attributable to common stockholders $ 13,022     $ 2,898     $ 8,246     $ 1,942     $ 2,944     $ 725   Reallocation of net income attributable to participating securities 14      -      29      -      19      -    Reallocation of net income as a result of conversion of Class B to Class A common stock 2,898      -      1,942      -      725      -    Reallocation of net income to Class B common stock  -      (13 )    -      14      -      15   Net income attributable to common stockholders for diluted EPS $ 15,934     $ 2,885     $ 10,217     $ 1,956     $ 3,688     $ 740   Denominator                       Number of shares used for basic EPS computation 2,373     528     2,317     546     2,249     554   Conversion of Class B to Class A common stock 528      -      546      -      554      -    Weighted average effect of dilutive securities:                       Employee stock options 4     4     6     6     8     8   RSUs 49     3     49     5     37     9   Shares subject to repurchase and other 2      -      7     3     5     2   Number of shares used for diluted EPS computation 2,956     535     2,925     560     2,853     573   Diluted EPS $ 5.39     $ 5.39     $ 3.49     $ 3.49     $ 1.29     $ 1.29 71 Note 3.

In addition, the gross unrealized loss that had been in a continuous loss position for 12 months or longer was not significant as of December 31, 2017 and 2016. As of December 31, 2017, we considered the decreases in market value on our marketable securities to be temporary in nature and did not consider any of our investments to be other-than-temporarily impaired.

In July 2017, we settled our Level 2 contingent consideration liability that was outstanding as of December 31, 2016. 73 Note 5. Property and Equipment Property and equipment consists of the following (in millions): December 31,    2017   2016 Land $ 798     $ 696   Buildings 4,909     3,109   Leasehold improvements 959     531   Network equipment 7,998     5,179   Computer software, office equipment and other 681     398   Construction in progress 2,992     1,890   Total 18,337     11,803   Less: Accumulated depreciation (4,616 )   (3,212 ) Property and equipment, net $ 13,721     $ 8,591 Depreciation expense on property and equipment was $2.33 billion, $1.59 billion, and $1.22 billion during 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. Property and equipment as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 includes $533 million and $283 million, respectively, acquired under capital lease agreements, of which a substantial majority, is included in network equipment. Accumulated depreciation of property and equipment acquired under these capital leases was $101 million and $30 million at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Construction in progress includes costs mostly related to construction of data centers, office buildings, and network equipment infrastructure to support our data centers around the world. The construction of office buildings includes leased office spaces for which we are considered to be the owner for accounting purposes. See Note 9 in these notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. No interest was capitalized during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015. Note 6. Goodwill and Intangible Assets During the year ended December 31, 2017, we completed several business acquisitions that were not material to our consolidated financial statements, either individually or in the aggregate. Accordingly, pro forma historical results of operations related to these business acquisitions during the year ended December 31, 2017 have not been presented. We have included the financial results of these business acquisitions in our consolidated financial statements from their respective dates of acquisition. Goodwill generated from all business acquisitions completed during the year ended December 31, 2017 was primarily attributable to expected synergies from future growth and potential monetization opportunities. The amount of goodwill generated during this period that was deductible for tax purposes was not material. The changes in the carrying amount of goodwill for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 are as follows (in millions): Balance as of December 31, 2015 $ 18,026   Goodwill acquired 95   Effect of currency translation adjustment 1   Balance as of December 31, 2016 $ 18,122   Goodwill acquired 90   Effect of currency translation adjustment 9   Balance as of December 31, 2017 $ 18,221 74 Intangible assets consist of the following (in millions): December 31, 2017   December 31, 2016   Weighted-Average Remaining Useful Lives (in years)   Gross Carrying Amount   Accumulated Amortization   Net Carrying Amount   Gross Carrying Amount   Accumulated Amortization   Net Carrying Amount                             Acquired users 3.8   $ 2,056     $ (971 )   $ 1,085     $ 2,056     $ (678 )   $ 1,378   Acquired technology 1.8   972     (711 )   261     931     (518 )   413   Acquired patents 5.7   785     (499 )   286     785     (420 )   365   Trade names 2.2   629     (406 )   223     629     (293 )   336   Other 2.7   162     (133 )   29     162     (119 )   43   Total intangible assets 3.6   $ 4,604     $ (2,720 )   $ 1,884     $ 4,563     $ (2,028 )   $ 2,535 Amortization expense of intangible assets for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015 was $692 million, $751 million, and $730 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2017, expected amortization expense for the unamortized acquired intangible assets for the next five years and thereafter is as follows (in millions): 2018 $ 633   2019 540   2020 365   2021 265   2022 29   Thereafter 52   Total $ 1,884 Note 7.

Long-term Debt In May 2016, we entered into a $2.0 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility, and any amounts outstanding under this facility will be due and payable on May 20, 2021. As of December 31, 2017, no amounts had been drawn down and we were in compliance with the covenants under the facility. Note 9. Commitments and Contingencies Commitments Leases We have entered into various non-cancelable operating lease agreements for certain of our offices, land, facilities, colocations, and data centers with original lease periods expiring between 2018 and 2038. We are committed to pay a portion of the related actual operating expenses under certain of these lease agreements. Certain of these arrangements have free rent periods or escalating rent payment provisions, and we recognize rent expense under such arrangements on a straight-line basis. The following is a schedule, by years, of the future minimum lease payments required under non-cancelable operating leases as of December 31, 2017 (in millions): Operating Leases   Financing obligation, building in progress - leased facilities(1) 2018 $ 409     $  -    2019 464     2   2020 470     14   2021 448     15   2022 430     15   Thereafter 2,423     149   Total minimum lease payments $ 4,644     $ 195 (1) We entered into agreements to lease office buildings that are under construction. As a result of our involvement during these construction periods, we are considered for accounting purposes to be the owner of the construction projects. Financing obligation, building in progress - leased facilities represent the total expected financing and lease obligations associated with these leases and will be settled through monthly lease payments to the landlords when we occupy the office spaces upon completion. This amount includes $72 million that is included in property and equipment, net and other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2017. Operating lease expense was $363 million, $269 million, and $196 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. We fully repaid all our capital lease obligations during 2016. Other contractual commitments We also have $2.95 billion of non-cancelable contractual commitments as of December 31, 2017, primarily related to network infrastructure and our data center operations. These commitments are primarily due within five years. Contingencies Legal Matters Beginning on May 22, 2012, multiple putative class actions, derivative actions, and individual actions were filed in state and federal courts in the United States and in other jurisdictions against us, our directors, and/or certain of our officers alleging violation of securities laws or breach of fiduciary duties in connection with our initial public offering (IPO) and seeking unspecified damages. We believe these lawsuits are without merit, and we intend to continue to vigorously defend them. The vast majority of the cases in the United States, along with multiple cases filed against The NASDAQ OMX Group, Inc. and The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (collectively referred to herein as NASDAQ) alleging technical and other trading-related errors by NASDAQ in connection with our IPO, were ordered centralized for coordinated or consolidated pre-trial proceedings in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. In a series of rulings in 2013 and 2014, the court denied our motion to dismiss the consolidated securities class action and granted our motions to dismiss the derivative actions against our directors and certain of our officers. On July 24, 2015, the court of appeals affirmed the dismissal of the derivative actions. On December 11, 2015, the court granted plaintiffs' motion for class certification in the consolidated securities action. On April 14, 2017, we filed a motion for summary judgment. Trial is scheduled to begin on February 26, 2018. In addition, from time to time, we are subject to litigation and other proceedings involving law enforcement and other regulatory agencies, including in particular in Brazil and Europe, in order to ascertain the precise scope of our legal obligations to comply with 76 the requests of those agencies, including our obligation to disclose user information in particular circumstances. A number of such instances have resulted in the assessment of fines and penalties against us. We believe we have multiple legal grounds to satisfy these requests or prevail against associated fines and penalties, and we intend to vigorously defend such fines and penalties. Although we believe that it is reasonably possible that we may incur a loss in some of these cases, we are currently unable to estimate the amount of such losses. We are also party to various other legal proceedings, claims, and regulatory, tax or government inquiries and investigations that arise in the ordinary course of business. With respect to these matters, we evaluate the developments on a regular basis and accrue a liability when we believe a loss is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. We believe that the amount or any estimable range of reasonably possible or probable loss will not, either individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. However, the outcome of these matters is inherently uncertain. Therefore, if one or more of these matters were resolved against us for amounts in excess of management's expectations, our results of operations and financial condition, including in a particular reporting period in which any such outcome becomes probable and estimable, could be materially adversely affected. For information regarding income tax contingencies, see Note 12  -  Income Taxes. Indemnifications In the normal course of business, to facilitate transactions of services and products, we have agreed to indemnify certain parties with respect to certain matters. We have agreed to hold certain parties harmless against losses arising from a breach of representations or covenants, or out of intellectual property infringement or other claims made by third parties. These agreements may limit the time within which an indemnification claim can be made and the amount of the claim. In addition, we have entered into indemnification agreements with our officers, directors, and certain employees, and our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain similar indemnification obligations. It is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount under these indemnification agreements due to the limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement. Historically, payments made by us under these agreements have not had a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In our opinion, as of December 31, 2017, there was not at least a reasonable possibility we had incurred a material loss with respect to indemnification of such parties. We have not recorded any liability for costs related to indemnification through December 31, 2017. Note 10. Stockholders' Equity Common Stock Our certificate of incorporation authorizes the issuance of Class A common stock and Class B common stock. As of December 31, 2017, we are authorized to issue 5,000 million shares of Class A common stock and 4,141 million shares of Class B common stock, each with a par value of $0.000006 per share. Holders of our Class A common stock and Class B common stock are entitled to dividends when, as and if, declared by our board of directors, subject to the rights of the holders of all classes of stock outstanding having priority rights to dividends. As of December 31, 2017, we have not declared any dividends and our credit facility contains restrictions on our ability to pay dividends. The holder of each share of Class A common stock is entitled to one vote, while the holder of each share of Class B common stock is entitled to ten votes. Shares of our Class B common stock are convertible into an equivalent number of shares of our Class A common stock and generally convert into shares of our Class A common stock upon transfer. Class A common stock and Class B common stock are referred to as common stock throughout the notes to these financial statements, unless otherwise noted. As of December 31, 2017, there were 2,397 million shares and 509 million shares of Class A common stock and Class B common stock, respectively, issued and outstanding. Abandonment of the Reclassification In September 2017, our board of directors decided to abandon the proposal to create a new class of non-voting capital stock (Class C capital stock) and the intention to issue a dividend of two shares of Class C capital stock for each outstanding share of Class A and Class B common stock (the Reclassification). As a result, we will not proceed with the filing of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation which was approved by our stockholders on June 20, 2016. 77 Share Repurchase Program In November 2016, our board of directors authorized a $6.0 billion share repurchase program of our Class A common stock, which commenced in 2017 and does not have an expiration date. The timing and actual number of shares repurchased depend on a variety of factors, including price, general business and market conditions, and other investment opportunities, and shares may be repurchased through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions, including through the use of trading plans intended to qualify under Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we repurchased and subsequently retired approximately 13 million shares of our Class A common stock for an aggregate amount of approximately $2.07 billion. Share-based Compensation Plans We maintain two share-based employee compensation plans: the 2012 Equity Incentive Plan, which was amended in June 2016 (2012 Plan), and the 2005 Stock Plan (collectively, Stock Plans). Our 2012 Plan serves as the successor to our 2005 Stock Plan and provides for the issuance of incentive and nonstatutory stock options, restricted stock awards, stock appreciation rights, RSUs, performance shares, and stock bonuses to qualified employees, directors and consultants. Outstanding awards under the 2005 Stock Plan continue to be subject to the terms and conditions of the 2005 Stock Plan. We initially reserved 25 million shares of our Class A common stock for issuance under our 2012 Plan. The number of shares reserved for issuance under our 2012 Plan increases automatically on January 1 of each of the calendar years during the term of the 2012 Plan, which will continue through and including April 2026 unless terminated earlier by our board of directors or a committee thereof, by a number of shares of Class A common stock equal to the lesser of (i) 2.5% of the total issued and outstanding shares of our Class A common stock as of the immediately preceding December 31st or (ii) a number of shares determined by our board of directors. Pursuant to this automatic increase provision, our board of directors elected not to increase the number of shares reserved for issuance in 2017 and 2016, and approved an increase of 42 million shares reserved for issuance effective as of January 1, 2018. In addition, shares available for grant under the 2005 Stock Plan, which were reserved but not issued, forfeited or repurchased at their original issue price, or subject to outstanding awards under the 2005 Stock Plan as of the effective date of our IPO, were added to the reserves of the 2012 Plan and shares that are withheld in connection with the net settlement of RSUs are also added to the reserves of the 2012 Plan.

The aggregate intrinsic value of the options exercised in the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015 was $359 million, $309 million, and $403 million, respectively. The total grant date fair value of stock options vested during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015 was not material.

The fair value as of the respective vesting dates of RSUs that vested during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015 was $6.76 billion, $4.92 billion, and $4.23 billion, respectively. Starting in 2016, upon adoption of ASU 2016-09, we account for forfeitures as they occur. As of December 31, 2017, there was $7.72 billion of unrecognized share-based compensation expense, substantially all of which was related to RSUs. This unrecognized compensation expense is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately three years. Included in this unrecognized share-based compensation expense are 9.5 million unvested shares as of December 31, 2017, related to RSU inducement award granted to an employee in connection with the WhatsApp acquisition in 2014. This award is subject to acceleration if the recipient's employment is terminated without ""cause"" or if the recipient resigns for ""good reason"". Note 11.

(2) Due to the Tax Act which was enacted in December 2017, provisional mandatory transition tax on accumulated foreign earnings was accrued as of December 31, 2017. In addition, deferred taxes were derecognized for previous estimated tax liabilities that would arise upon repatriation of a portion of these earnings in the foreign jurisdictions. Our U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2017 were re-measured from 35% to 21%.The provisional effects of the Tax Act are $2.53 billion of current income tax expense and $257 million of deferred income tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2017. 80 Our deferred tax assets (liabilities) are as follows (in millions):   December 31,    2017   2016 Deferred tax assets:       Net operating loss carryforward $ 1,300     $ 1,252   Tax credit carryforward 509     268   Share-based compensation 385     684   Accrued expenses and other liabilities 381     339   Other 131     149   Total deferred tax assets 2,706     2,692   Less: valuation allowance (438 )   (240 ) Deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowance 2,268     2,452           Deferred tax liabilities:       Depreciation and amortization (622 )   (535 ) Purchased intangible assets (309 )   (706 ) Deferred taxes on foreign income (88 )   (357 ) Total deferred tax liabilities (1,019 )   (1,598 ) Net deferred tax assets $ 1,249     $ 854 The Tax Act reduces the U.S. statutory corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% for our tax years beginning in 2018, which resulted in the re-measurement of the federal portion of our deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2017 from 35% to the new 21% tax rate. The valuation allowance was approximately $438 million and $240 million as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, mostly related to state tax credits that we do not believe will ultimately be realized. As of December 31, 2017, the U.S. federal and state net operating loss carryforwards were $5.36 billion and $2.50 billion, which will begin to expire in 2033 and 2032, respectively, if not utilized. We have federal and state tax credit carryforwards of $142 million and $1.38 billion, respectively, which will begin to expire in 2033 and 2032, respectively, if not utilized. Utilization of our net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards may be subject to substantial annual limitations due to the ownership change limitations provided by the Internal Revenue Code and similar state provisions. Such annual limitations could result in the expiration of the net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards before their utilization. The events that may cause ownership changes include, but are not limited to, a cumulative stock ownership change of greater than 50% over a three-year period. The Tax Act imposes a mandatory transition tax on accumulated foreign earnings and eliminates US taxes on foreign subsidiary distribution. As a result, earnings in foreign jurisdictions are available for distribution to the U.S. without incremental U.S. taxes. The following table reflects changes in the gross unrecognized tax benefits (in millions): Year Ended December 31,    2017   2016   2015 Gross unrecognized tax benefits-beginning of period $ 3,309     $ 3,017     $ 1,682   Increases related to prior year tax positions 72     32     322   Decreases related to prior year tax positions (34 )   (36 )   (52 ) Increases related to current year tax positions 536     307     1,066   Decreases related to settlements of prior year tax positions (13 )   (11 )   (1 ) Gross unrecognized tax benefits-end of period $ 3,870     $ 3,309     $ 3,017 During all years presented, we recognized interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the provision for income taxes on the consolidated statements of income. The amount of interest and penalties accrued as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 was $154 million and $80 million, respectively. If the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits of $3.87 billion as of December 31, 2017 were realized in a future period, this would result in a tax benefit of $2.67 billion within our provision of income taxes at such time. 81 We are subject to taxation in the United States and various other state and foreign jurisdictions. The material jurisdictions in which we are subject to potential examination include the United States and Ireland. We are under examination by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for our 2011 through 2013 tax years and Ireland for our 2012 through 2015 tax years. Our 2014 and subsequent years remain open to examination by the IRS. Our 2016 and subsequent years remain open to examination in Ireland. In July 2016, we received a Statutory Notice of Deficiency (Notice) from the IRS related to transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries in conjunction with the examination of the 2010 tax year. While the Notice applies only to the 2010 tax year, the IRS states that it will also apply its position for tax years subsequent to 2010, which, if the IRS prevails in its position, could result in an additional federal tax liability of an estimated aggregate amount of approximately $3.0 billion to $5.0 billion in excess of originally filed U.S. return, plus interest and any penalties asserted. We do not agree with the position of the IRS and have filed a petition in the United States Tax Court challenging the Notice. We have previously accrued an estimated unrecognized tax benefit consistent with the guidance in ASC 740 that is lower than the potential additional federal tax liability of $3.0 billion to $5.0 billion in excess of the originally filed U.S. return, plus interest and penalties. If the IRS prevails in the assessment of additional tax due based on its position, the assessed tax, interest and penalties, if any, could have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. As of December 31, 2017, we have not resolved this matter and proceedings continue in the United States Tax Court. We believe that adequate amounts have been reserved for any adjustments that may ultimately result from these examinations. We believe that adequate amounts have been reserved for any adjustments to the provision for income taxes or other tax items that may ultimately result from these examinations. Although the timing of the resolution, settlement, and closure of any audits is highly uncertain, it is reasonably possible that the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits could significantly change in the next 12 months. Given the number of years remaining that are subject to examination, we are unable to estimate the full range of possible adjustments to the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits.

Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Our management, with the participation of our chief executive officer (CEO) and chief financial officer (CFO), has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a- 15(e) and 15d- 15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (Exchange Act)), as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Based on such evaluation, our CEO and CFO have concluded that as of December 31, 2017, our disclosure controls and procedures are designed at a reasonable assurance level and are effective to provide reasonable assurance that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our CEO and CFO, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria set forth in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework). Based on the assessment, management has concluded that its internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2017 to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Our independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst & Young LLP, has issued an audit report with respect to our internal control over financial reporting, which appears in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Changes in Internal Control There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in management's evaluation pursuant to Rules 13a-15(d) or 15d-15(d) of the Exchange Act during the fourth quarter of 2017 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures and Internal Control over Financial Reporting In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs.","https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1326801/0001326801-18-000009-index.html"
"Eaton Corp plc","10-K","2018","1","Item 1. Business. Eaton Corporation plc (Eaton or the Company) is a power management company with 2017 net sales of $20.4 billion. The Company provides energy-efficient solutions that help its customers effectively manage electrical, hydraulic and mechanical power more efficiently, safely and sustainably. Eaton has approximately 96,000 employees in 59 countries and sells products to customers in more than 175 countries. Eaton electronically files or furnishes reports pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) to the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), including annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and proxy and information statements, as well as any amendments to those reports. As soon as reasonably practicable, these reports are available free of charge through the Company's website at www.eaton.com. These filings are also accessible on the SEC's website at www.sec.gov. Business Segment Information Information by business segment and geographic region regarding principal products, principal markets, methods of distribution, net sales, operating profit and assets is presented in Note 15 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Additional information regarding Eaton's segments and business is presented below. Electrical Products and Electrical Systems and Services Principal methods of competition in these segments are performance of products and systems, technology, customer service and support, and price. Eaton has a strong competitive position in these segments and, with respect to many products, is considered among the market leaders. In normal economic cycles, sales of these segments are historically lower in the first quarter and higher in the third and fourth quarters of a year. In 2017, 21% of these segments' sales were made to six large distributors of electrical products and electrical systems and services. Hydraulics Principal methods of competition in this segment are product performance, geographic coverage, service, and price. Eaton has a strong competitive position in this segment and, with respect to many products, is considered among the market leaders. Sales of this segment are historically higher in the first and second quarters and lower in the third and fourth quarters of the year. In 2017, 9% of this segment's sales were made to three large original equipment manufacturers or distributors of agricultural, construction, and industrial equipment and parts. Aerospace Principal methods of competition in this segment are total cost of ownership, product and system performance, quality, design engineering capabilities, and timely delivery. Eaton has a strong competitive position in this segment and, with respect to many products and platforms, is considered among the market leaders. In 2017, 29% of this segment's sales were made to three large original equipment manufacturers of aircraft. Vehicle Principal methods of competition in this segment are product performance, technology, global service, and price. Eaton has a strong competitive position in this segment and, with respect to many products, is considered among the market leaders. In 2017, 69% of this segment's sales were made to nine large original equipment manufacturers of vehicles and related components. Information Concerning Eaton's Business in General Raw Materials Eaton's major requirements for raw materials include iron, steel, copper, nickel, aluminum, brass, tin, silver, lead, titanium, rubber, plastic, electronic components, chemicals and fluids. Materials are purchased in various forms, such as extrusions, castings, powder metal, metal sheets and strips, forging billets, bar stock, and plastic pellets. Raw materials, as well as parts and other components, are purchased from many suppliers. Under normal circumstances, the Company has no difficulty obtaining its raw materials. In 2017, Eaton maintained appropriate levels of inventory to prevent shortages and did not experience any availability constraints. 2 Table of Contents Patents and Trademarks Eaton considers its intellectual property, including without limitation patents, trade names, domain names, trademarks, confidential information, and trade secrets to be of significant value to its business as a whole. The Company's products are manufactured, marketed and sold under a portfolio of patents, trademarks, licenses, and other forms of intellectual property, some of which expire or are allowed to lapse at various dates in the future. Eaton develops and acquires new intellectual property on an ongoing basis and considers all of its intellectual property to be valuable. Based on the broad scope of the Company's product lines, management believes that the loss or expiration of any single intellectual property right would not have a material effect on Eaton's consolidated financial statements or its business segments. The Company's policy is to file applications and obtain patents for the majority of its novel and innovative new products including product modifications and improvements. Order Backlog A significant portion of open orders placed with Eaton are by original equipment manufacturers or distributors. These open orders are not considered firm as they have been historically subject to releases by customers. In measuring backlog orders, only the amount of orders to which customers are firmly committed are included. Using this criterion, total backlog at December 31, 2017 and 2016 was approximately $4.8 billion and $4.0 billion, respectively. Backlog should not be relied upon as being indicative of results of operations for future periods. Research and Development Research and development expenses for new products and improvement of existing products in 2017, 2016 and 2015 were $584 million, $589 million, and $625 million, respectively. Over the past five years, the Company has invested approximately $3.1 billion in research and development. Environmental Contingencies Operations of the Company involve the use and disposal of certain substances regulated under environmental protection laws. Eaton continues to modify processes on an ongoing, regular basis in order to reduce the impact on the environment, including the reduction or elimination of certain chemicals used in, and wastes generated from, operations. Compliance with laws that have been enacted or adopted regulating the discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment, are not expected to have a material adverse effect upon earnings or the competitive position of the Company. Eaton's estimated capital expenditures for environmental control facilities are not expected to be material for 2018 and 2019. Information regarding the Company's liabilities related to environmental matters is presented in Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.","Item 1A. Risk Factors. Among the risks that could materially adversely affect Eaton's businesses, financial condition or results of operations are the following: Volatility of end markets that Eaton serves. Eaton's segment revenues, operating results, and profitability have varied in the past and may vary from quarter to quarter in the future. Profitability can be negatively impacted by volatility in the end markets that Eaton serves. The Company has undertaken measures to reduce the impact of this volatility through diversification of the markets it serves and expansion of the geographic regions in which it operates. Future downturns in any of the markets could adversely affect revenues, operating results, and profitability. Eaton's operating results depend in part on continued successful research, development, and marketing of new and/or improved products and services, and there can be no assurance that Eaton will continue to successfully introduce new products and services. The success of new and improved products and services depends on their initial and continued acceptance by Eaton's customers. The Company's businesses are affected, to varying degrees, by technological change and corresponding shifts in customer demand, which could result in unpredictable product transitions or shortened life cycles. Eaton may experience difficulties or delays in the research, development, production, or marketing of new products and services which may prevent Eaton from recouping or realizing a return on the investments required to bring new products and services to market. 3 Table of Contents Eaton's ability to attract, develop and retain executives and other qualified employees is crucial to the Company's results of operations and future growth. Eaton depends on the continued services and performance of key executives, senior management, and skilled personnel, particularly professionals with experience in its industry and business. Eaton cannot be certain that any of these individuals will continue his or her employment with the Company. A lengthy period of time is required to hire and develop replacement personnel when skilled personnel depart. An inability to hire, develop, and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees could materially hinder the business by, for example, delaying Eaton's ability to bring new products to market or impairing the success of the Company's operations. Eaton's operations depend on production facilities throughout the world, which subjects them to varying degrees of risk of disrupted production. Eaton manages businesses with manufacturing facilities worldwide. The Company's manufacturing facilities and operations could be disrupted by a natural disaster, labor strike, war, political unrest, terrorist activity, economic upheaval, or public health concerns. Some of these conditions are more likely in certain geographic regions in which Eaton operates. Any such disruption could cause delays in shipments of products and the loss of sales and customers, and insurance proceeds may not adequately compensate for losses. If Eaton is unable to protect its information technology infrastructure against service interruptions, data corruption, cyber-based attacks or network security breaches, operations could be disrupted or data confidentiality lost. Eaton relies on information technology networks and systems, including the Internet, to process, transmit and store electronic information, and to manage or support a variety of business processes and activities, including procurement, manufacturing, distribution, invoicing and collection. These technology networks and systems may be susceptible to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to failures during the process of upgrading or replacing software, databases or components; power outages; hardware failures; or computer viruses. In addition, security breaches could result in unauthorized disclosure of confidential information. If these information technology systems suffer severe damage, disruption, breach, or shutdown, and business continuity plans do not effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner, there could be a negative impact on operating results or the Company may suffer financial or reputational damage. Further, Cyber-based risks could also include attacks targeting the security, integrity and/or reliability of the hardware, software and information installed, stored or transmitted in our products, including after the purchase of those products and when they are incorporated into third party products, facilities or infrastructure. Such attacks could result in disruptions to third party systems, unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information and corruption of data (our own or that of third parties). Further, to a significant extent, the security of our customers' systems depends on how those systems are protected, configured, updated and monitored, all of which are typically outside our control. Eaton's global operations subject it to economic risk as Eaton's results of operations may be adversely affected by changes in government legislation, regulations and policies and currency fluctuations. Operating globally subjects Eaton to changes in government regulations and policies in a large number of jurisdictions around the world, including those related to tariffs and trade barriers, investments, property ownership rights, taxation, and exchange controls. Changes in the relative values of currencies occur from time to time and could affect Eaton's operating results. While the Company monitors exchange rate exposures and attempts to reduce these exposures through hedging activities, these risks could adversely affect operating results. Further, existing free trade laws and regulations, such as the North American Free Trade Agreement, provide certain beneficial duties and tariffs for qualifying imports and exports, subject to compliance with the applicable classification and other requirements. Changes in laws or policies governing the terms of foreign trade, and in particular increased trade restrictions, tariffs or taxes on imports from countries where we manufacture products could have an impact on our business and financial results. Eaton may be subject to risks relating to changes in its tax rates or exposure to additional income tax liabilities. Eaton is subject to income taxes in many jurisdictions around the world. Income tax liabilities are subject to the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. The Company's effective tax rate could be affected by changes in the mix among earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation allowance of deferred tax assets, or changes in tax laws. The amount of income taxes paid is subject to ongoing audits by tax authorities in the countries in which Eaton operates. If these audits result in assessments different from amounts reserved, future financial results may include unfavorable adjustments to the Company's tax liabilities. 4 Table of Contents Eaton uses a variety of raw materials and components in its businesses, and significant shortages, price increases, or supplier insolvencies could increase operating costs and adversely impact the competitive positions of Eaton's products. Eaton's major requirements for raw materials are described above in Item 1 ""Raw Materials"". Significant shortages could affect the prices Eaton's businesses are charged and the competitive position of their products and services, all of which could adversely affect operating results. Further, Eaton's suppliers of component parts may increase their prices in response to increases in costs of raw materials that they use to manufacture component parts. The Company may not be able to increase its prices commensurately with its increased costs, adversely affecting operating results. Eaton may be unable to adequately protect its intellectual property rights, which could affect the Company's ability to compete. Protecting Eaton's intellectual property rights is critical to its ability to compete and succeed. The Company owns a large number of patents and patent applications worldwide, as well as trademark and copyright registrations that are necessary, and contribute significantly, to the preservation of Eaton's competitive position in various markets. Although management believes that the loss or expiration of any single intellectual property right would not have a material effect on the results of operations or financial position of Eaton or its business segments, there can be no assurance that any one, or more, of these patents and other intellectual property will not be challenged, invalidated, or circumvented by third parties. Eaton enters into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with the Company's employees, and into non-disclosure agreements with suppliers and appropriate customers, so as to limit access to and disclosure of proprietary information. These measures may not suffice to deter misappropriation or independent third party development of similar technologies. Eaton is subject to litigation and environmental regulations that could adversely impact Eaton's businesses. At any given time, Eaton may be subject to litigation, the disposition of which may have a material adverse effect on the Company's businesses, financial condition or results of operations. Information regarding current legal proceedings is presented in Note 8 and Note 9 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.","Item 7.

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures - Pursuant to SEC Rule 13a-15, an evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of Eaton's management, including Craig Arnold - Principal Executive Officer; and Richard H. Fearon - Principal Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures. Based on that evaluation, Eaton's management concluded that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2017. Disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in Company reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in Company reports filed under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Company's Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002 and the rules and regulations adopted pursuant thereto, Eaton has included a report of management's assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, which is included in Item 15 of this Form 10-K. ""Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"" relating to internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017 is included in Item 15 of this Form 10-K.

"Kraft Heinz Co","10-K","2018","1","Item 1.  Business. General Kraft Heinz is one of the largest food and beverage companies in the world, with sales in approximately 190 countries and territories. We manufacture and market food and beverage products, including condiments and sauces, cheese and dairy, meals, meats, refreshment beverages, coffee, and other grocery products, throughout the world, under a host of iconic brands including Heinz, Kraft, Oscar Mayer, Philadelphia, Velveeta, Lunchables, Planters, Maxwell House, Capri Sun, Ore-Ida, Kool-Aid, Jell-O. A globally recognized producer of delicious foods, we provide products for all occasions whether at home, in restaurants or on the go. As of December 30, 2017, we had assets of $120.2 billion. Our common stock is listed on The NASDAQ Global Select Market (""NASDAQ"") under the ticker symbol ""KHC"". On July 2, 2015 (the ""2015 Merger Date""), through a series of transactions, we consummated the merger of Kraft Foods Group, Inc. (""Kraft"") with and into a wholly-owned subsidiary of H.J. Heinz Holding Corporation (""Heinz"") (the ""2015 Merger""). At the closing of the 2015 Merger, Heinz was renamed The Kraft Heinz Company and H. J. Heinz Company changed its name to Kraft Heinz Foods Company. While we were organized as a Delaware corporation in 2013 (as Heinz), both Kraft and Heinz each had been pioneers in the food industry for over 100 years. Before the consummation of the 2015 Merger, Heinz was controlled by Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (""Berkshire Hathaway"") and 3G Global Food Holdings, L.P. (""3G Capital"") (together, the ""Sponsors""), following their acquisition of H. J. Heinz Company (the ""2013 Merger""). See Note 1, Background and Basis of Presentation, and Note 2, Merger and Acquisition, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on the 2015 Merger. Reportable Segments We manage and report our operating results through four segments. We have three reportable segments defined by geographic region: United States, Canada, and Europe. Our remaining businesses are combined and disclosed as ""Rest of World"". Rest of World is comprised of two operating segments: Latin America; and Asia Pacific, Middle East, and Africa (""AMEA""). In the third quarter of 2017, we announced our plans to reorganize certain of our international businesses to better align our global geographies. These plans include moving our Middle East and Africa businesses from the AMEA segment into the Europe segment, forming the Europe, Middle East, and Africa (""EMEA"") segment. The remaining AMEA businesses will become the Asia Pacific (""APAC"") segment, which will remain in Rest of World. We expect these changes to become effective in the first quarter of 2018. As a result, we expect to restate our Europe and Rest of World segments to reflect these changes for historical periods presented in the first quarter of 2018. See Note 19, Segment Reporting, to the consolidated financial statements for our geographic financial information by segment. Net Sales by Product Category In the first quarter of 2017, we reorganized the products within our product categories to reflect how we manage our business. We have reflected this change for all historical periods presented. The product categories that contributed 10% or more to consolidated net sales in any of the periods presented were: December 30,  2017 (52 weeks)   December 31,  2016 (52 weeks)   January 3,  2016 (53 weeks) Condiments and sauces 25 %   24 %   32 % Cheese and dairy 21 %   21 %   15 % Ambient meals 9 %   9 %   10 % Frozen and chilled meals 10 %   10 %   12 % Meats and seafood 10 %   10 %   8 % We completed the 2015 Merger on July 2, 2015. As a result, 2016 was the first full year of combined Kraft and Heinz results, while 2015 included a full year of Heinz results and post-2015 Merger results of Kraft. The year-over-year fluctuations in the percentages between 2015 and 2016 are primarily driven by including Kraft's results. 1 Sales and Customers Our products are sold through our own sales organizations and through independent brokers, agents and distributors to chain, wholesale, cooperative and independent grocery accounts, convenience stores, drug stores, value stores, bakeries, pharmacies, mass merchants, club stores, foodservice distributors and institutions, including hotels, restaurants, hospitals, health care facilities, and certain government agencies. Our products are also sold online through various e-commerce platforms and retailers. Our largest customer, Walmart Inc., represented approximately 21% of our net sales in 2017, approximately 22% of our net sales in 2016, and approximately 20% of our net sales in 2015. Additionally, we have significant customers in different regions around the world; however, none of these customers individually are material to our consolidated business. In 2017, the five largest customers in our United States segment accounted for approximately 48% of United States segment net sales, the five largest customers in our Canada segment accounted for approximately 72% of Canada segment net sales, and the five largest customers in our Europe segment accounted for approximately 31% of our Europe segment net sales. Raw Materials and Packaging We manufacture (and contract for the manufacture of) our products from a wide variety of raw food materials. We purchase and use large quantities of commodities, including dairy products, meat products, coffee beans, nuts, tomatoes, potatoes, soybean and vegetable oils, sugar and other sweeteners, corn products, wheat and other goods to manufacture our products. In addition, we purchase and use significant quantities of resins and cardboard to package our products and natural gas to operate our facilities. For commodities that we use across many of our product categories, such as corrugated paper and energy, we coordinate sourcing requirements and centralize procurement to leverage our scale. In addition, some of our product lines and brands separately source raw materials that are specific to their operations. We source these commodities from a variety of providers including large, international producers, and smaller, local, independent sellers. Where appropriate, we seek to establish preferred purchaser status and/or have developed strategic partnerships with many of our suppliers with the objective of achieving favorable pricing and dependable supply for many of our commodities. The prices of raw materials and agricultural materials that we use in our products are affected by external factors, such as global competition for resources, currency fluctuations, severe weather or global climate change, consumer, industrial or investment demand, and changes in governmental regulation and trade, alternative energy, and agricultural programs. Our procurement teams monitor worldwide supply and cost trends so we can obtain ingredients and packaging needed for production at competitive prices. Although the prices of our principal raw materials can be expected to fluctuate, we believe there will be an adequate supply of the raw materials we use and that they are generally available from numerous sources. We use a range of hedging techniques in an effort to limit the impact of price fluctuations on many of our principal raw materials. However, we do not fully hedge against changes in commodity prices, and our hedging strategies may not protect us from increases in specific raw material costs. We actively monitor changes to commodity costs so that we can seek to mitigate the effect through pricing and other operational measures. Competition Our products are sold in highly competitive marketplaces, which have experienced increased concentration and the growing presence of e-commerce retailers, large-format retailers, and discounters. Competitors include large national and international food and beverage companies and numerous local and regional companies. We compete with both branded and generic products, in addition to retailer brands, wholesalers, and cooperatives. We compete primarily on the basis of product quality and innovation, brand recognition and loyalty, service, the ability to identify and satisfy consumer preferences, the introduction of new products and the effectiveness of our advertising campaigns and marketing programs, distribution, shelf space, merchandising support, and price. Improving our market position or introducing new products requires substantial advertising and promotional expenditures. 2 Trademarks and Intellectual Property Our trademarks are material to our business and are among our most valuable assets. Depending on the country, trademarks generally remain valid for as long as they are in use or their registration status is maintained. Trademark registrations generally are for renewable, fixed terms. Significant trademarks by segment based on net sales in 2017 were: Majority Owned and Licensed Trademarks United States   Kraft, Oscar Mayer, Heinz, Philadelphia, Lunchables, Velveeta, Planters, Maxwell House, Capri Sun*, Ore-Ida, Kool-Aid, Jell-O Canada   Kraft, Heinz, Philadelphia, Cracker Barrel, P'Tit Cheese, Maxwell House, Tassimo*, Classico Europe   Heinz, Plasmon, Pudliszki, Honig, HP, Benedicta Rest of World   Heinz, ABC, Master, Quero, Golden Circle, Kraft, Wattie's, Glucon D, Complan *Used under license We sell some products under brands we license from third parties, including Capri Sun packaged drink pouches for sale in the United States, TGI Fridays frozen snacks and appetizers in the United States and Canada, McCafe ground, whole bean, and on-demand single cup coffees in the United States and Canada, and Taco Bell Home Originals Mexican-style food products in U.S. grocery stores. In our agreements with Mondelez International, Inc. (""Mondelez International""), we each granted the other party various licenses to use certain of our and their respective intellectual property rights in named jurisdictions for certain periods of time following the spin-off of Kraft from Mondelez International in 2012. We own numerous patents worldwide. We consider our portfolio of patents, patent applications, patent licenses under patents owned by third parties, proprietary trade secrets, technology, know-how processes, and related intellectual property rights to be material to our operations. Patents, issued or applied for, cover inventions ranging from basic packaging techniques to processes relating to specific products and to the products themselves. While our patent portfolio is material to our business, the loss of one patent or a group of related patents would not have a material adverse effect on our business. Our issued patents extend for varying periods according to the date of the patent application filing or grant and the legal term of patents in the various countries where patent protection is obtained. The actual protection afforded by a patent, which can vary from country to country, depends upon the type of patent, the scope of its coverage as determined by the patent office or courts in the country, and the availability of legal remedies in the country. Research and Development Our research and development focuses on achieving the following four objectives:  growth through product improvements and renovation, innovation, and line extensions,  uncompromising product safety and quality,  superior customer satisfaction, and  cost reduction. Research and development expense was approximately $93 million in 2017, $120 million in 2016, and $105 million in 2015. Seasonality Although crops constituting some of our raw food ingredients are harvested on a seasonal basis, most of our products are produced throughout the year. Seasonal factors inherent in our business change the demand for products, including holidays, changes in seasons, or other annual events. These factors influence our quarterly sales, operating income, and cash flows. Employees We had approximately 39,000 employees as of December 30, 2017. 3 Regulation The manufacture and sale of consumer food and beverage products is highly regulated. Our business operations, including the production, transportation, storage, distribution, sale, display, advertising, marketing, labeling, quality and safety of our products and their ingredients, occupational safety and health practices, are subject to various laws and regulations administered by federal, state and local governmental agencies in the United States, as well as laws and regulations administered by government entities and agencies outside the United States in markets in which our products are manufactured, distributed or sold. In the U.S., our activities are subject to regulation by various federal government agencies, including the Food and Drug Administration, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Federal Trade Commission, Department of Labor, Department of Commerce and Environmental Protection Agency, as well as various state and local agencies. We are also subject to numerous similar and other laws and regulations outside of North America, including but not limited to laws and regulations governing food safety, health and safety, anti-corruption, and data privacy. In our business dealings, we are also required to comply with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (""FCPA""), the U.K. Bribery Act, the Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act, and various other anti-corruption regulations in the regions in which we operate. We rely on legal and operational compliance programs, as well as in-house and outside counsel, to guide our businesses in complying with applicable laws and regulations of the countries in which we do business. Environmental Regulation Our activities throughout the world are highly regulated and subject to government oversight. Various laws concerning the handling, storage, and disposal of hazardous materials and the operation of facilities in environmentally sensitive locations may impact aspects of our operations. In the United States, where a significant portion of our business operates, these laws and regulations include the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (""CERCLA""). CERCLA imposes joint and several liability on each potentially responsible party. We are involved in a number of active proceedings in the United States under CERCLA (and other similar state actions and legislation) related to our current operations and certain closed, inactive, or divested operations for which we retain liability. We do not currently expect these to have a material effect on our earnings or financial condition. As of December 30, 2017, we had accrued an amount we deemed appropriate for environmental remediation. Based on information currently available, we believe that the ultimate resolution of existing environmental remediation actions and our compliance in general with environmental laws and regulations will not have a material effect on our earnings or financial condition. However, it is difficult to predict with certainty the potential impact of future compliance efforts and environmental remedial actions and thus, future costs associated with such matters may exceed current reserves.

Risk Factors. We operate in a highly competitive industry. The food and beverage industry is highly competitive across all of our product offerings. We compete based on product innovation, price, product quality, nutritional value, service, taste, convenience, brand recognition and loyalty, effectiveness of marketing and distribution, promotional activity, and the ability to identify and satisfy consumer preferences. We may need to reduce our prices in response to competitive and customer pressures. These pressures may also restrict our ability to increase prices in response to commodity and other cost increases. Failure to effectively assess, timely change and set proper pricing or trade incentives may negatively impact the achievement of our objectives. The rapid emergence of new distribution channels, particularly e-commerce, may create consumer price deflation, affecting our retail customer relationships and presenting additional challenges to increasing prices in response to commodity or other cost increases. We may also need to increase or reallocate spending on marketing, retail trade incentives, materials, advertising, and new product innovation to maintain or increase market share. These expenditures are subject to risks, including uncertainties about trade and consumer acceptance of our efforts. If we are unable to compete effectively, our profitability, financial condition, and operating results may suffer. Changes in the retail landscape or the loss of key retail customers could adversely affect our financial performance. Retail customers, such as supermarkets, warehouse clubs, and food distributors in our major markets, may continue to consolidate, resulting in fewer but larger customers for our business across various channels. Consolidation also produces larger retail customers that may seek to leverage their position to improve their profitability by demanding improved efficiency, lower pricing, more favorable terms, increased promotional programs, or specifically tailored product offerings. In addition, larger retailers have the scale to develop supply chains that permit them to operate with reduced inventories or to develop and market their own retailer brands. Retail consolidation and increasing retailer power could materially and adversely affect our product sales, financial condition, and operating results. Retail consolidation also increases the risk that adverse changes in our customers' business operations or financial performance may have a corresponding material and adverse effect on us. For example, if our customers cannot access sufficient funds or financing, then they may delay, decrease, or cancel purchases of our products, or delay or fail to pay us for previous purchases, which could materially and adversely affect our product sales, financial condition, and operating results. In addition, technology-based systems, which give consumers the ability to shop through e-commerce websites and mobile commerce applications, are also significantly altering the retail landscape in many of our markets. If we are unable to adjust to developments in these changing landscapes, we may be disadvantaged in key channels and with certain consumers, which could materially and adversely affect our product sales, financial condition, and operating results. Maintaining, extending, and expanding our reputation and brand image are essential to our business success. We have many iconic brands with long-standing consumer recognition across the globe. Our success depends on our ability to maintain brand image for our existing products, extend our brands to new platforms, and expand our brand image with new product offerings. We seek to maintain, extend, and expand our brand image through marketing investments, including advertising and consumer promotions, and product innovation. Negative perceptions on the role of food and beverage marketing could adversely affect our brand image or lead to stricter regulations and scrutiny of marketing practices. Existing or increased legal or regulatory restrictions on our advertising, consumer promotions, and marketing, or our response to those restrictions, could limit our efforts to maintain, extend, and expand our brands. Moreover, adverse publicity about legal or regulatory action against us, our quality and safety, our environmental or social impacts, or our suppliers and, in some cases, our competitors, could damage our reputation and brand image, undermine our customers' confidence, and reduce demand for our products, even if the regulatory or legal action is unfounded or not material to our operations. In addition, our success in maintaining, extending, and expanding our brand image depends on our ability to adapt to a rapidly changing media environment. We increasingly rely on social media and online dissemination of advertising campaigns. The growing use of social and digital media increases the speed and extent that information, including misinformation, and opinions can be shared. Negative posts or comments about us, our brands or our products, or our suppliers and, in some cases, our competitors, on social or digital media, whether or not valid, could seriously damage our brands and reputation. In addition, we might fail to anticipate consumer preferences, invest sufficiently in maintaining, extending, and expanding our brand image. If we do not maintain, extend, and expand our reputation or brand image, then our product sales, financial condition, and operating results could be materially and adversely affected. 6 Our international operations subject us to additional risks and costs and may cause our profitability to decline. We are a global company with sales in approximately 190 countries and territories; approximately 30% of our 2017 net sales were generated outside of the United States. As a result, we are subject to risks inherent in global operations. These risks, which can vary substantially by market, are described in many of the risk factors discussed in this section and also include:  compliance with U.S. laws affecting operations outside of the United States, including anti-bribery laws such as the FCPA;  changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in tax laws or their interpretation, or tax audit implications;  the imposition of increased or new tariffs, quotas, trade barriers or similar restrictions on our sales or regulations, taxes or policies that might negatively affect our sales;  currency devaluations or fluctuations in currency values;  compliance with antitrust and competition laws, data privacy laws, and a variety of other local, national and multi-national regulations and laws in multiple jurisdictions;  discriminatory or conflicting fiscal policies in or across foreign jurisdictions;  changes in capital controls, including currency exchange controls, government currency policies or other limits on our ability to import raw materials or finished product into various countries or repatriate cash from outside the United States;  challenges associated with cross-border product distribution;  changes in local regulations and laws, the uncertainty of enforcement of remedies in foreign jurisdictions, and foreign ownership restrictions and the potential for nationalization or expropriation of property or other resources;  risks and costs associated with political and economic instability, corruption, anti-American sentiment and social and ethnic unrest in the countries in which we operate;  the risks of operating in developing or emerging markets in which there are significant uncertainties regarding the interpretation, application and enforceability of laws and regulations and the enforceability of contract rights and intellectual property rights;  risks arising from the significant and rapid fluctuations in currency exchange markets and the decisions and positions that we take to hedge such volatility;  changing labor conditions and difficulties in staffing our operations;  greater risk of uncollectible accounts and longer collection cycles; and  design, implementation and use of effective control environment processes across our diverse operations and employee base. In addition, political and economic changes or volatility, geopolitical regional conflicts, terrorist activity, political unrest, civil strife, acts of war, public corruption, expropriation and other economic or political uncertainties could interrupt and negatively affect our business operations or customer demand. Slow economic growth or high unemployment in the markets in which we operate could constrain consumer spending, and declining consumer purchasing power could adversely impact our profitability. All of these factors could result in increased costs or decreased sales, and could materially and adversely affect our product sales, financial condition, and results of operations. We must leverage our brand value to compete against retailer brands and other economy brands. In nearly all of our product categories, we compete with branded products as well as retailer and other economy brands, which are typically sold at lower prices. Our products must provide higher value and/or quality to our consumers than alternatives, particularly during periods of economic uncertainty. Consumers may not buy our products if relative differences in value and/or quality between our products and retailer or other economy brands change in favor of competitors' products or if consumers perceive this type of change. If consumers prefer retailer or other economy brands, then we could lose market share or sales volumes or shift our product mix to lower margin offerings. A change in consumer preferences could also cause us to increase capital, marketing, and other expenditures, which could materially and adversely affect our product sales, financial condition, and operating results. 7 Our financial success depends on our ability to correctly predict, identify, and interpret changes in consumer preferences and demand, to offer new products to meet those changes, and to respond to competitive innovation. Consumer preferences for food and beverage products change continually. Our success depends on our ability to predict, identify, and interpret the tastes and dietary habits of consumers and to offer products that appeal to consumer preferences, including with respect to health and wellness. If we do not offer products that appeal to consumers, our sales and market share will decrease, which could materially and adversely affect our product sales, financial condition, and operating results. We must distinguish between short-term fads, mid-term trends, and long-term changes in consumer preferences. If we do not accurately predict which shifts in consumer preferences will be long-term, or if we fail to introduce new and improved products to satisfy those preferences, our sales could decline. In addition, because of our varied consumer base, we must offer an array of products that satisfy a broad spectrum of consumer preferences. If we fail to expand our product offerings successfully across product categories, or if we do not rapidly develop products in faster growing or more profitable categories, demand for our products could decrease, which could materially and adversely affect our product sales, financial condition, and operating results. Prolonged negative perceptions concerning the health implications of certain food and beverage products could influence consumer preferences and acceptance of some of our products and marketing programs. We strive to respond to consumer preferences and social expectations, but we may not be successful in our efforts. Continued negative perceptions and failure to satisfy consumer preferences could materially and adversely affect our product sales, financial condition, and operating results. In addition, achieving growth depends on our successful development, introduction, and marketing of innovative new products and line extensions. There are inherent risks associated with new product or packaging introductions, including uncertainties about trade and consumer acceptance or potential impacts on our existing product offerings. We may be required to increase expenditures for new product development. Successful innovation depends on our ability to correctly anticipate customer and consumer acceptance, to obtain, protect and maintain necessary intellectual property rights, and to avoid infringing upon the intellectual property rights of others. We must also be able to respond successfully to technological advances by and intellectual property rights of our competitors, and failure to do so could compromise our competitive position and impact our product sales, financial condition, and operating results. We may be unable to drive revenue growth in our key product categories, increase our market share, or add products that are in faster growing and more profitable categories. Our future results will depend on our ability to drive revenue growth in our key product categories and growth in the food and beverage industry in the countries in which we operate. Our future results will also depend on our ability to enhance our portfolio by adding innovative new products in faster growing and more profitable categories and our ability to increase market share in our existing product categories. Our failure to drive revenue growth, limit market share decreases in our key product categories, or develop innovative products for new and existing categories could materially and adversely affect our product sales, financial condition, and operating results. An impairment of the carrying value of goodwill or other indefinite-lived intangible assets could negatively affect our consolidated operating results. We test goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment at least annually in the second quarter or when a triggering event occurs. We performed our annual impairment testing in the second quarter of 2017. The first step of the goodwill impairment test compares the reporting unit's estimated fair value with its carrying value. If the carrying value of a reporting unit's net assets exceeds its fair value, the second step would be applied to measure the difference between the carrying value and implied fair value of goodwill. If the carrying value of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, the goodwill would be considered impaired and would be reduced to its implied fair value. We test indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment by comparing the fair value of each intangible asset with its carrying value. If the carrying value exceeds fair value, the intangible asset would be considered impaired and would be reduced to its fair value. Fair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions, estimates and market factors. Estimating the fair value of individual reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets requires us to make assumptions and estimates regarding our future plans, as well as industry and economic conditions. These assumptions and estimates include projected revenues and income growth rates, terminal growth rates, competitive and consumer trends, market-based discount rates, and other market factors. If current expectations of future growth rates are not met or market factors outside of our control, such as discount rates, change significantly, then one or more reporting units or intangible assets might become impaired in the future. As goodwill and intangible assets associated with recently acquired businesses are recorded on the balance sheet at their estimated acquisition date fair values, those amounts are more susceptible to an impairment risk if business operating results or macroeconomic conditions deteriorate. Additionally, recently impaired intangible assets can also be more susceptible to future impairment as they are recorded on the balance sheet at their recently estimated fair values. 8 An impairment of the carrying value of goodwill or other indefinite-lived intangible assets could negatively affect our operating results or net worth. Commodity, energy, and other input prices are volatile and could negatively affect our consolidated operating results. We purchase and use large quantities of commodities, including dairy products, meat products, coffee beans, nuts, soybean and vegetable oils, sugar and other sweeteners, corn products, tomatoes, cucumbers, potatoes, onions, other fruits and vegetables, spices, flour, and wheat to manufacture our products. In addition, we purchase and use significant quantities of resins, cardboard, glass, plastic, metal, paper, fiberboard, and other materials to package our products and we use other inputs, such as water and natural gas, to operate our facilities. We are also exposed to changes in oil prices, which influence both our packaging and transportation costs. Prices for commodities, energy, and other supplies are volatile and can fluctuate due to conditions that are difficult to predict, including global competition for resources, currency fluctuations, severe weather or global climate change, crop failures or shortages due to plant disease or insect and other pest infestation, consumer, industrial or investment demand, and changes in governmental regulation and trade, alternative energy, including increased demand for biofuels, and agricultural programs. Additionally, we may be unable to maintain favorable arrangements with respect to the costs of procuring raw materials, packaging, services, and transporting products, which could result in increased expenses and negatively affect our operations. Furthermore, the cost of raw materials and finished products may fluctuate due to movements in cross-currency transaction rates. Rising commodity, energy, and other input costs could materially and adversely affect our cost of operations, including the manufacture, transportation, and distribution of our products, which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and operating results. Although we monitor our exposure to commodity prices as an integral part of our overall risk management program, and seek to hedge against input price increases to the extent we deem appropriate, we do not fully hedge against changes in commodity prices, and our hedging strategies may not protect us from increases in specific raw materials costs. For example, hedging our costs for one of our key commodities, dairy products, is difficult because dairy futures markets are not as developed as many other commodities futures markets. Continued volatility or sustained increases in the prices of commodities and other supplies we purchase could increase the costs of our products, and our profitability could suffer. Moreover, increases in the prices of our products to cover these increased costs may result in lower sales volumes. If we are not successful in our hedging activities, or if we are unable to price our products to cover increased costs, then commodity and other input price volatility or increases could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and operating results. We rely on our management team and other key personnel. We depend on the skills, working relationships, and continued services of key personnel, including our experienced management team. In addition, our ability to achieve our operating goals depends on our ability to identify, hire, train, and retain qualified individuals. We compete with other companies both within and outside of our industry for talented personnel, and we may lose key personnel or fail to attract, train, and retain other talented personnel. Any such loss or failure could adversely affect our product sales, financial condition, and operating results. We may be unable to realize the anticipated benefits from streamlining actions to reduce fixed costs, simplify or improve processes, and improve our competitiveness. We have implemented a number of cost savings initiatives, including our Integration Program (as defined below), that we believe are important to position our business for future success and growth. We have evaluated changes to our organization structure to enable us to reduce costs, simplify or improve processes, and improve our competitiveness. Our future success may depend upon our ability to realize the benefits of our cost savings initiatives. In addition, certain of our initiatives may lead to increased costs in other aspects of our business such as increased conversion, outsourcing, or distribution costs. We must be efficient in executing our plans to achieve cost savings and operate efficiently in the highly competitive food and beverage industry, particularly in an environment of increased competitive activity. To capitalize on our efforts, we must carefully evaluate investments in our business, and execute on those areas with the most potential return on investment. If we are unable to realize the anticipated benefits from our efforts, we could be cost disadvantaged in the marketplace, and our competitiveness, production, and profitability could be adversely affected. 9 Changes in our relationships with significant customers or suppliers could adversely impact us. We derive significant portions of our sales from certain significant customers (see Sales and Customers within Item 1, Business, of this report). There can be no assurance that all of our significant customers will continue to purchase our products in the same mix or quantities or on the same terms as in the past, particularly as increasingly powerful retailers may demand lower pricing and focus on developing their own brands. The loss of a significant customer or a material reduction in sales or a change in the mix of products we sell to a significant customer could materially and adversely affect our product sales, financial condition, and operating results. Disputes with significant suppliers, including disputes related to pricing or performance, could adversely affect our ability to supply products to our customers and could materially and adversely affect our product sales, financial condition, and operating results. In addition, the financial condition of such customers and suppliers is affected in large part by conditions and events that are beyond our control. A significant deterioration in the financial condition of significant customers and suppliers could materially and adversely affect our product sales, financial condition, and operating results. We may not be able to successfully execute our international expansion strategy. We plan to drive additional growth and profitability through international markets. Consumer demands, behaviors, tastes and purchasing trends may differ in international markets and, as a result, our sales may not be successful or meet expectations, or the margins on those sales may be less than currently anticipated. We may also face difficulties integrating foreign business operations with our current sourcing, distribution, information technology systems, and other operations. Any of these challenges could hinder our success in new markets or new distribution channels. There can be no assurance that we will successfully complete any planned international expansion or that any new business will be profitable or meet our expectations. Changes in tax laws and interpretations could adversely affect our business. We are subject to income and other taxes in the U.S. and in numerous foreign jurisdictions. Our domestic and foreign tax liabilities are dependent on the jurisdictions in which profits are determined to be earned and taxed. Additionally, the amount of taxes paid is subject to our interpretation of applicable tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate. A number of factors influence our effective tax rate, including changes in tax laws and treaties as well as the interpretation of existing laws and rules. Federal, state, and local governments and administrative bodies within the U.S., which represents a majority of our operations, and other foreign jurisdictions have implemented, or are considering, a variety of broad tax, trade, and other regulatory reforms that may impact us. For example, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the ""U.S. Tax Reform"") enacted on December 22, 2017 resulted in changes in our corporate tax rate, our deferred income taxes, and the taxation of foreign earnings. We are still assessing the impact of the U.S. Tax Reform, and while a number of impacts are anticipated to be positive, certain provisions may have adverse or uncertain effects. Relatedly, changes in tax laws resulting from the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development's (OECD) multi-jurisdictional plan of action to address ""base erosion and profit sharing"" could impact our effective tax rate. It is not currently possible to accurately determine the potential impact of these proposed or future changes, but these changes could have a material impact on our business. Significant judgment, knowledge, and experience are required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. Our future effective tax rate is impacted by a number of factors including changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, increases in expenses not deductible for tax, including impairment of goodwill in connection with acquisitions, and changes in available tax credits. In the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. We are also regularly subject to audits by tax authorities. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals. Economic and political pressures to increase tax revenue in various jurisdictions may make resolving tax disputes more difficult. The results of an audit or litigation could adversely affect our financial statements in the period or periods for which that determination is made. Compliance with changes in laws, regulations, and related interpretations could impact our business. As a large, global food and beverage company, we operate in a highly-regulated environment with constantly-evolving legal and regulatory frameworks. Various laws and regulations govern production, storage, distribution, sales, advertising, labeling, including on-pack claims, information or disclosures, marketing, licensing, trade, labor, tax, and environmental matters, as well as health and safety practices. Government authorities regularly change laws and regulations and their interpretations. Our compliance with new or revised laws and regulations, or the interpretation and application of existing laws and regulations, could materially and adversely affect our product sales, financial condition, and results of operations. As a consequence of the legal and regulatory environment in which we operate, we are faced with a heightened risk of legal claims and regulatory enforcement actions. 10 Although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with existing laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that courts or regulators will agree with our interpretations or that our employees, contractors, or agents will not violate our policies and procedures. Moreover, a failure to maintain effective control processes could lead to violations, unintentional or otherwise, of laws and regulations. Legal claims or regulatory enforcement actions arising out of our failure or alleged failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could subject us to civil and criminal penalties that could materially and adversely affect our product sales, reputation, financial condition, and operating results. In addition, the costs and other effects of defending potential and pending litigation and administrative actions against us may be difficult to determine and could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results. Product recalls or other product liability claims could materially and adversely affect us. Selling products for human consumption involves inherent legal and other risks, including product contamination, spoilage, product tampering, allergens, or other adulteration. We could decide to, or be required to, recall products due to suspected or confirmed product contamination, adulteration, product mislabeling or misbranding, tampering, or other deficiencies. Product recalls or market withdrawals could result in significant losses due to their costs, the destruction of product inventory, and lost sales due to the unavailability of the product for a period of time. We could be adversely affected if consumers lose confidence in the safety and quality of certain food products or ingredients, or the food safety system generally. Adverse attention about these types of concerns, whether or not valid, may damage our reputation, discourage consumers from buying our products, or cause production and delivery disruptions. We may also suffer losses if our products or operations violate applicable laws or regulations, or if our products cause injury, illness, or death. In addition, our marketing could face claims of false or deceptive advertising or other criticism. A significant product liability or other legal judgment or a related regulatory enforcement action against us, or a significant product recall, may materially and adversely affect our reputation and profitability. Moreover, even if a product liability or fraud claim is unsuccessful, has no merit, or is not pursued, the negative publicity surrounding assertions against our products or processes could materially and adversely affect our product sales, financial condition, and operating results. Unanticipated business disruptions could adversely affect our ability to provide our products to our customers. We have a complex network of suppliers, owned manufacturing locations, co-manufacturing locations, distribution networks, and information systems that support our ability to consistently provide our products to our customers. Factors that are hard to predict or beyond our control, such as weather, raw material shortages, natural disasters, fire or explosion, political unrest, terrorism, generalized labor unrest, or health pandemics, could damage or disrupt our operations or our suppliers' or co-manufacturers' operations. These disruptions may require additional resources to restore our supply chain or distribution network. If we cannot respond to disruptions in our operations, whether by finding alternative suppliers or replacing capacity at key manufacturing or distribution locations, or if we are unable to quickly repair damage to our information, production, or supply systems, we may be late in delivering, or be unable to deliver, products to our customers and may also be unable to track orders, inventory, receivables, and payables. If that occurs, our customers' confidence in us and long-term demand for our products could decline. Any of these events could materially and adversely affect our product sales, financial condition, and operating results. We may not successfully identify or complete strategic acquisitions, alliances, divestitures or joint ventures. From time to time, we may evaluate acquisition candidates, alliances, or joint ventures that may strategically fit our business objectives or we may consider divesting businesses that do not meet our strategic objectives or growth or profitability targets. These activities may present financial, managerial, and operational risks including, but not limited to, diversion of management's attention from existing core businesses, difficulties integrating or separating personnel and financial and other systems, inability to effectively and immediately implement control environment processes across a diverse employee population, adverse effects on existing or acquired customer and supplier business relationships, and potential disputes with buyers, sellers, or partners. Activities in such areas are regulated by numerous antitrust and competition laws in the United States, the European Union, and other jurisdictions, and we may be required to obtain the approval of acquisition and joint venture transactions by competition authorities, as well as to satisfy other legal requirements. To the extent we undertake acquisitions, alliances, joint ventures, or other developments outside our core regions or in new categories, we may face additional risks related to such developments. For example, risks related to foreign operations include compliance with U.S. laws affecting operations outside of the United States, such as the FCPA, currency rate fluctuations, compliance with foreign regulations and laws, including tax laws, and exposure to politically and economically volatile developing markets. Any of these factors could materially and adversely affect our product sales, financial condition, and operating results. 11 Our performance may be adversely affected by economic and political conditions in the United States and in various other nations where we do business. Our performance has been in the past and may continue in the future to be impacted by economic and political conditions in the United States and in other nations where we do business. Economic and financial uncertainties in our international markets, including uncertainties surrounding the United Kingdom's impending withdrawal from the European Union (commonly referred to as ""Brexit"") and changes to major international trade arrangements (e.g., the North American Free Trade Agreement), could negatively impact our operations and sales. Other factors impacting our operations in the United States and in international locations where we do business include export and import restrictions, currency exchange rates, currency devaluation, cash repatriation restrictions, recessionary conditions, foreign ownership restrictions, nationalization, the impact of hyperinflationary environments, terrorist acts, and political unrest. Such factors in either domestic or foreign jurisdictions could materially and adversely affect our product sales, financial condition, and operating results. For further information on Venezuela, see Note 13, Venezuela - Foreign Currency and Inflation, to the consolidated financial statements. Volatility of capital markets or macro-economic factors could adversely affect our business. Changes in financial and capital markets, including market disruptions, limited liquidity, and interest rate volatility, may increase the cost of financing as well as the risks of refinancing maturing debt. In addition, our borrowing costs can be affected by short and long-term ratings assigned by rating organizations. A decrease in these ratings could limit our access to capital markets and increase our borrowing costs, which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and operating results. Some of our customers and counterparties are highly leveraged. Consolidations in some of the industries in which our customers operate have created larger customers, some of which are highly leveraged and facing increased competition and continued credit market volatility. These factors have caused some customers to be less profitable and increased our exposure to credit risk. A significant adverse change in the financial and/or credit position of a customer or counterparty could require us to assume greater credit risk relating to that customer or counterparty and could limit our ability to collect receivables. This could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and liquidity. Our results could be adversely impacted as a result of increased pension, labor, and people-related expenses. Inflationary pressures and any shortages in the labor market could increase labor costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated operating results or financial condition. Our labor costs include the cost of providing employee benefits in the United States, Canada, and other foreign jurisdictions, including pension, health and welfare, and severance benefits. Any declines in market returns could adversely impact the funding of pension plans, the assets of which are invested in a diversified portfolio of equity and fixed-income securities and other investments. Additionally, the annual costs of benefits vary with increased costs of health care and the outcome of collectively-bargained wage and benefit agreements. Furthermore, we may be subject to increased costs or experience adverse effects to our operating results if we are unable to renew collectively bargained agreements on satisfactory terms. Our financial condition and ability to meet the needs of our customers could be materially and adversely affected if strikes or work stoppages and interruptions occur as a result of delayed negotiations with union-represented employees both in and outside of the United States. Volatility in the market value of all or a portion of the derivatives we use to manage exposures to fluctuations in commodity prices may cause volatility in our operating results and net income. We use commodity futures and options to partially hedge the price of certain input costs, including dairy products, coffee beans, meat products, wheat, corn products, soybean oils, sugar and natural gas. Changes in the values of these derivatives are currently recorded in net income, resulting in volatility in both gross profits and net income. We report these gains and losses in cost of products sold in our consolidated statements of income to the extent we utilize the underlying input in our manufacturing process. We report these gains and losses in general corporate expenses in our segment operating results until we sell the underlying products, at which time we reclassify the gains and losses to segment operating results. We may experience volatile earnings as a result of these accounting treatments. 12 Our net sales and net income may be exposed to exchange rate fluctuations. We derive a substantial portion of our net sales from international operations. We hold assets and incur liabilities, earn revenue, and pay expenses in a variety of currencies other than the U.S. dollar, primarily the British pound sterling, euro, Australian dollar, Canadian dollar, New Zealand dollar, Brazilian real, Indonesian rupiah, and Chinese renminbi. Since our consolidated financial statements are denominated in U.S. dollars, fluctuations in exchange rates from period to period will have an impact on our reported results. We have implemented currency hedges intended to reduce our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. However, these hedging strategies may not be successful and any of our unhedged foreign exchange exposures will continue to be subject to market fluctuations. In addition, in certain circumstances, we may incur costs in one currency related to services or products for which we are paid in a different currency. As a result, factors associated with international operations, including changes in foreign currency exchange rates, could significantly affect our results of operations and financial condition. We are significantly dependent on information technology and we may be unable to protect our information systems against service interruption, misappropriation of data, or breaches of security. We rely on information technology networks and systems, including the Internet, to process, transmit, and store electronic and financial information, to manage a variety of business processes and activities, and to comply with regulatory, legal, and tax requirements. We also depend on our information technology infrastructure for digital marketing activities and for electronic communications among our locations, personnel, customers, and suppliers. These information technology systems, some of which are managed by third parties, may be susceptible to damage, invasions, disruptions, or shutdowns due to hardware failures, computer viruses, hacker attacks, and other cybersecurity risks, telecommunication failures, user errors, catastrophic events or other factors. If our information technology systems suffer severe damage, disruption, or shutdown, by unintentional or malicious actions of employees and contractors or by cyber-attacks, and our business continuity plans do not effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner, we could experience business disruptions, reputational damage, transaction errors, processing inefficiencies, the leakage of confidential information, and the loss of customers and sales, causing our product sales, financial condition, and operating results to be adversely affected and the reporting of our financial results to be delayed. In addition, if we are unable to prevent security breaches or disclosure of non-public information, we may suffer financial and reputational damage, litigation or remediation costs, fines, or penalties because of the unauthorized disclosure of confidential information belonging to us or to our partners, customers, consumers, or suppliers. Misuse, leakage, or falsification of information could result in violations of data privacy laws and regulations, damage to our reputation and credibility, loss of opportunities to acquire or divest of businesses or brands, and loss of ability to commercialize products developed through research and development efforts and, therefore, could have a negative impact on net sales. In addition, we may suffer financial and reputational damage because of lost or misappropriated confidential information belonging to us, our current or former employees, or to our suppliers or consumers, and may become subject to legal action and increased regulatory oversight. We could also be required to spend significant financial and other resources to remedy the damage caused by a security breach or to repair or replace networks and information systems. Our intellectual property rights are valuable, and any inability to protect them could reduce the value of our products and brands. We consider our intellectual property rights, particularly and most notably our trademarks, but also our patents, trade secrets, copyrights and licensing agreements, to be a significant and valuable aspect of our business. We attempt to protect our intellectual property rights through a combination of patent, trademark, copyright, and trade secret laws, as well as licensing agreements, third-party nondisclosure and assignment agreements, and policing of third-party misuses of our intellectual property. Our failure to obtain or adequately protect our trademarks, products, new features of our products, or our technology, or any change in law or other changes that serve to lessen or remove the current legal protections of our intellectual property, may diminish our competitiveness and could materially harm our business. We may be unaware of intellectual property rights of others that may cover some of our technology, brands, or products. Any litigation regarding patents or other intellectual property could be costly and time-consuming and could divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations. Third-party claims of intellectual property infringement might also require us to enter into costly license agreements. We also may be subject to significant damages or injunctions against development and sale of certain products. 13 Our results of operations could be affected by natural events in the locations in which we or our customers, suppliers or regulators operate. We may be impacted by severe weather and other geological events, including hurricanes, earthquakes, floods or tsunamis that could disrupt our operations or the operations of our customers, suppliers, and regulators. Natural disasters or other disruptions at any of our facilities or our suppliers' facilities may impair or delay the delivery of our products. Influenza or other pandemics could disrupt production of our products, reduce demand for certain of our products, or disrupt the marketplace in the foodservice or retail environment with consequent material adverse effects on our results of operations. While we insure against many of these events and certain business interruption risks, we cannot provide any assurance that such insurance will compensate us for any losses incurred as a result of natural or other disasters. To the extent we are unable to, or cannot, financially mitigate the likelihood or potential impact of such events, or effectively manage such events if they occur, particularly when a product is sourced from a single location, there could be a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations, and additional resources could be required to restore our supply chain. Our level of indebtedness could adversely affect our business. We have a substantial amount of indebtedness, and are permitted to incur a substantial amount of additional indebtedness, including secured debt. Our existing debt, together with any incurrence of additional indebtedness, could have important consequences, including, but not limited to:  increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;  limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, research and development, debt service requirements, acquisitions, and general corporate or other purposes;  resulting in a downgrade to our credit rating, which could adversely affect our cost of funds, liquidity, and access to capital markets;  restricting us from making strategic acquisitions or causing us to make non-strategic divestitures;  limiting our ability to adjust to changing market conditions and place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors who are not as highly leveraged;  making it more difficult for us to make payments on our existing indebtedness;  requiring a substantial portion of cash flows from operations to be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness, thereby reducing our ability to use our cash flow to fund our operations, capital expenditures and future business opportunities;  exposing us to risks related to fluctuations in foreign currency as we earn profits in a variety of currencies around the world and substantially all of our debt is denominated in U.S. dollars; and  in the case of any additional indebtedness, exacerbating the risks associated with our substantial financial leverage. In addition, there can be no assurance that we will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future debt or equity financings will be available to us to enable us to pay our indebtedness or to fund other needs. As a result, we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity. There is no assurance that we will be able to refinance any of our indebtedness on favorable terms, or at all. Any inability to generate sufficient cash flow or to refinance our indebtedness on favorable terms could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. The creditors who hold our debt could also accelerate amounts due in the event that we default, which could potentially trigger a default or acceleration of the maturity of our other debt. If our operating performance declines, we may in the future need to obtain waivers from the required creditors under our indebtedness instruments to avoid being in default. If we breach the covenants under our indebtedness instruments and seek a waiver, we may not be able to obtain a waiver from the required creditors. If this occurs, we would be in default under our indebtedness instruments, the creditors could exercise their rights, as described above, and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation. 14 The Sponsors have substantial control over us and may have conflicts of interest with us in the future. The Sponsors own approximately 51% of our common stock. Six of our 11 directors had been directors of Heinz prior to the closing of the 2015 Merger and remained directors of Kraft Heinz pursuant to the merger agreement. In addition, some of our executive officers, including Bernardo Hees, our Chief Executive Officer, are partners of 3G Capital, one of the Sponsors. As a result, the Sponsors have the potential to exercise influence over management and have substantial control over decisions of our Board of Directors as well as over any action requiring the approval of the holders of our common stock, including adopting any amendments to our charter, electing directors, and approving mergers or sales of substantially all of our capital stock or our assets. In addition, to the extent that the Sponsors collectively hold a majority of our common stock, they together would have the power to take shareholder action by written consent to adopt amendments to our charter or take other actions, such as corporate transactions, that require the vote of holders of a majority of our outstanding common stock. The directors designated by the Sponsors may have significant authority to effect decisions affecting our capital structure, including the issuance of additional capital stock, incurrence of additional indebtedness, the implementation of stock repurchase programs and the decision of whether or not to declare dividends. Additionally, the Sponsors are in the business of making investments in companies and may from time to time acquire and hold interests in businesses that compete directly or indirectly with us. The Sponsors may also pursue acquisition opportunities that may be complementary to our business, and, as a result, those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us. So long as the Sponsors continue to own a significant amount of our equity, they will continue to be able to strongly influence or effectively control our decisions. Future sales of our common stock in the public market could cause volatility in the price of our common stock or cause the share price to fall. Sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that these sales might occur, could depress the market price of our common stock, and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities. Kraft Heinz, 3G Capital, and Berkshire Hathaway entered into a registration rights agreement requiring us to register for resale under the Securities Act all registrable shares held by 3G Capital and Berkshire Hathaway, which represents all shares of our common stock held by the Sponsors as of the date of the closing of the 2015 Merger. As of the closing of the 2015 Merger, registrable shares represented approximately 51% of our outstanding common stock on a fully diluted basis. Although the registrable shares are subject to certain holdback and suspension periods, the registrable shares are not subject to a ""lock-up"" or similar restriction under the registration rights agreement. Accordingly, sales of a large number of registrable shares may be made upon registration of such shares with the SEC in accordance with the terms of the registration rights agreement. Registration and sales of our common stock effected pursuant to the registration rights agreement will increase the number of shares being sold in the public market and may increase the volatility of the price of our common stock. Our ability to pay regular dividends to our shareholders is subject to the discretion of the Board of Directors and may be limited by our debt agreements or limitations under Delaware law. Although it is currently anticipated that we will continue to pay regular quarterly dividends, any such determination to pay dividends will be at the discretion of the Board of Directors and will be dependent on then-existing conditions, including our financial condition, income, legal requirements, including limitations under Delaware law, and other factors the Board of Directors deems relevant. The Board of Directors may, in its sole discretion, change the amount or frequency of dividends or discontinue the payment of dividends entirely. For these reasons, shareholders will not be able to rely on dividends to receive a return on investment. Accordingly, realization of any gain on shares of our common stock may depend on the appreciation of the price of our common stock, which may never occur. 15 While we have remediated the previously-identified material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, we may identify other material weaknesses in the future. In November 2017, we restated our consolidated financial statements for the quarters ended April 1, 2017 and July 1, 2017 in order to correctly classify cash receipts from the payments on sold receivables (which are cash receipts on the underlying trade receivables that have already been securitized) to cash provided by investing activities (from cash provided by operating activities) within our condensed consolidated statements of cash flows. In connection with these restatements, management identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting related to the misapplication of Accounting Standards Update 2016-15. Specifically, we did not maintain effective controls over the adoption of new accounting standards, including communication with the appropriate individuals in coming to our conclusions on the application of new accounting standards. As a result of this material weakness, our management concluded that we did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of April 1, 2017 and July 1, 2017. While we have remediated the material weakness and our management has determined that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 30, 2017, there can be no assurance that our controls will remain adequate. The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting is subject to various inherent limitations, including judgments used in decision-making, the nature and complexity of the transactions we undertake, assumptions about the likelihood of future events, the soundness of our systems, cost limitations, and other limitations. If other material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal control are discovered or occur in the future or we otherwise must restate our financial statements, it could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations or financial condition, restrict our ability to access the capital markets, require us to expend significant resources to correct the weaknesses or deficiencies, subject us to fines, penalties, investigations or judgments, harm our reputation, or otherwise cause a decline in investor confidence.","Item 7.  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Overview The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the other sections of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the consolidated financial statements and related notes contained in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. Description of the Company: We manufacture and market food and beverage products, including condiments and sauces, cheese and dairy, meals, meats, refreshment beverages, coffee, and other grocery products throughout the world. We manage and report our operating results through four segments. We have three reportable segments defined by geographic region: United States, Canada, and Europe. Our remaining businesses are combined and disclosed as ""Rest of World"". Rest of World is comprised of two operating segments: Latin America and AMEA. In the third quarter of 2017, we announced our plans to reorganize certain of our international businesses to better align our global geographies. These plans include moving our Middle East and Africa businesses from the AMEA operating segment into the EMEA operating segment. The remaining AMEA businesses will become the APAC operating segment. We currently expect these changes to become effective in the first quarter of our fiscal year 2018. As a result, we expect to restate our Europe and Rest of World segments to reflect these changes for historical periods presented as of March 31, 2018. 19 See Note 19, Segment Reporting, to the consolidated financial statements for our financial information by segment. Items Affecting Comparability of Financial Results The 2015 Merger: We completed the 2015 Merger on July 2, 2015. As a result, 2016 was the first full year of combined Kraft and Heinz results, while 2015 included a full year of Heinz results and post-2015 Merger results of Kraft. For comparability, we disclose in this report certain unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information, which presents 2015 as if the 2015 Merger had been consummated on December 30, 2013, the first business day of our 2014 fiscal year, and combines the historical results of Heinz and Kraft. See the Supplemental Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Information section at the end of this item for additional information. See Note 1, Background and Basis of Presentation, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information related to the 2015 Merger. Integration and Restructuring Expenses: In 2017, we substantially completed our multi-year program announced following the 2015 Merger (the ""Integration Program""), for which we expect to incur cumulative pre-tax costs of approximately $2.1 billion. Approximately 60% of these costs will be cash expenditures. As of December 30, 2017, we have incurred cumulative pre-tax costs of $2,055 million related to the Integration Program. These costs primarily included severance and employee benefit costs (including cash and non-cash severance), costs to exit facilities (including non-cash costs such as accelerated depreciation), and other costs incurred as a direct result of integration activities related to the 2015 Merger. Total expenses related to our restructuring activities, including the Integration Program, were $457 million in 2017, $1,012 million in 2016, and $1,023 million in 2015. Integration Program costs included in these totals were $339 million in 2017, $887 million in 2016, and $829 million in 2015. We anticipate cumulative capital expenditures of approximately $1.4 billion related to the Integration Program. As of December 30, 2017, we have incurred $1.3 billion in capital expenditures since the inception of the Integration Program. The Integration Program was designed to reduce costs, integrate, and optimize our combined organization. Since the inception of the Integration Program, our cumulative pre-tax savings achieved are approximately $1,725 million, primarily benefiting the United States and Canada segments. See Note 3, Integration and Restructuring Expenses, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. U.S. Tax Reform: On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (""U.S. Tax Reform"") was enacted by the U.S. federal government. The legislation significantly changed U.S. tax law by, among other things, lowering the federal corporate tax rate from 35.0% to 21.0%, effective January 1, 2018, implementing a territorial tax system, and imposing a one-time toll charge on deemed repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries as of December 30, 2017. The two material items that impacted us in 2017 were the corporate tax rate reduction and the one-time toll charge. While the corporate tax rate reduction is effective January 1, 2018, we accounted for this anticipated rate change in 2017, the period of enactment. We have estimated the provisional tax impacts related to the toll charge, certain components of the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, including depreciation and executive compensation, and the change in our indefinite reinvestment assertion. As a result, we recognized a net tax benefit of approximately $7.0 billion, including a reasonable estimate of our deferred income tax benefit of approximately $7.5 billion related to the corporate rate change, which was partially offset by a reasonable estimate of $312 million for the toll charge and approximately $125 million for other tax expenses, including a change in our indefinite reinvestment assertion. See Critical Accounting Policies within this item and Note 8, Income Taxes, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. 53rdWeek: On December 9, 2016, our Board of Directors approved a change to our fiscal year end from Sunday to Saturday. Effective December 31, 2016, we operate on a 52 or 53-week fiscal year ending on the last Saturday in December in each calendar year. In prior years, we operated on a 52 or 53-week fiscal year ending the Sunday closest to December 31. As a result, we occasionally have a 53rd week in a fiscal year. Our 2015 fiscal year included a 53rd week of activity. 20 Series A Preferred Stock: On June 7, 2016, we redeemed all outstanding shares of our Series A Preferred Stock. We funded this redemption primarily through the issuance of long-term debt in May 2016, as well as other sources of liquidity, including our commercial paper program, U.S. securitization program, and cash on hand. See Equity and Dividends within this item, along with Note 16, Debt, and Note 17, Capital Stock, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. Results of Operations Due to the size of Kraft's business relative to the size of Heinz's business prior to the 2015 Merger, and for purposes of comparability, the Results of Operations include certain unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information (the ""pro forma financial information"") adjusted to assume that Kraft and Heinz were a combined company for the full year 2015. This pro forma financial information reflects combined historical results, final purchase accounting adjustments, and adjustments to align accounting policies. The pro forma adjustments impacted our consolidated results and all of our segments. There are no pro forma adjustments for 2017 or 2016 as Kraft and Heinz were a combined company for these periods. For more information, see Supplemental Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Information. In addition, we disclose in this report certain non-GAAP financial measures, which, for 2015, are derived from the pro forma financial information. These non-GAAP financial measures assist management in comparing our performance on a consistent basis for purposes of business decision-making by removing the impact of certain items that management believes do not directly reflect our underlying operations. For additional information and reconciliations from our consolidated financial statements see Supplemental Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Information and Non-GAAP Financial Measures.

See the Supplemental Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Information at the end of this item. (b)  Organic Net Sales is a non-GAAP financial measure. See the Non-GAAP Financial Measures section at the end of this item. 21 Year Ended December 30, 2017 compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2016: Net sales and Organic Net Sales decreased 1.0% to $26.2 billion in 2017 compared to 2016 due to unfavorable volume/mix (1.5 pp) partially offset by higher pricing (0.5 pp). Volume/mix was unfavorable in the United States and Canada, partially offset by growth in Europe and Rest of World. Higher pricing in Rest of World and the United States was partially offset by lower pricing in Canada and Europe. Year Ended December 31, 2016 compared to the Year Ended January 3, 2016: Net sales increased 44.4% to $26.5 billion in 2016 compared to 2015, primarily driven by the 2015 Merger. Pro forma net sales decreased 3.5% primarily due to the unfavorable impacts of foreign currency (2.5 pp), 53rd week of shipments in 2015 (1.2 pp), and divestitures (0.1 pp). Excluding these impacts, Organic Net Sales increased 0.3% due to higher net pricing (0.3 pp) and neutral volume/mix (0.0 pp). Net pricing was higher in Rest of World, United States, and Canada despite deflation in key commodities (which we define as dairy, meat, coffee and nuts) in the United States and Canada, primarily in dairy, coffee, and meats in the United States. These price increases were partially offset by lower net pricing in Europe. Neutral volume/mix was primarily due to declines in meats and foodservice in the United States, partially offset by growth of condiments and sauces globally, and coffee and refrigerated meal combinations in the United States. Net Income: December 30,  2017 (52 weeks)   December 31,  2016 (52 weeks)   % Change   December 31,  2016 (52 weeks)   January 3,  2016 (53 weeks)   % Change   (in millions)       (in millions)     Operating income $ 6,773     $ 6,142     10.3 %   $ 6,142     $ 2,639     132.7 % Net income/(loss) attributable to common shareholders 10,999     3,452     218.6 %   3,452     (266 )   nm   Adjusted EBITDA(a) 7,930     7,778     1.9 %   7,778     6,739     15.4 % (a) Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure. See the Non-GAAP Financial Measures section at the end of this item. Year Ended December 30, 2017 compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2016: Operating income increased 10.3% to $6.8 billion in 2017 compared to $6.1 billion in 2016. This increase was primarily due to lower Integration Program and other restructuring expenses in the current period, savings from the Integration Program and other restructuring activities, and lower overhead costs, partially offset by higher input costs in local currency, lower Organic Net Sales, lower unrealized gains on commodity hedges in the current period, and the unfavorable impact of foreign currency (0.4 pp). Net income/(loss) attributable to common shareholders increased 218.6% to $11.0 billion in 2017 compared to $3.5 billion in 2016. The increase was primarily due to a lower effective tax rate in the current period, the operating income factors discussed above, and the absence of the Series A Preferred Stock dividend in the current period, partially offset by higher interest expense and higher other expense/(income), net, detailed as follows:  The effective tax rate was a 98.7% benefit in 2017 compared to 27.5% expense in 2016. The change in the effective tax rate was primarily driven by the $7.0 billion tax benefit from U.S. Tax Reform, lower tax benefits associated with deferred tax effects of statutory rate changes, and taxes on income of foreign subsidiaries in the current period. See Note 8, Income Taxes, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information related to our effective tax rates.  The Series A Preferred Stock was fully redeemed on June 7, 2016. Accordingly, there were no dividends for 2017, compared to $180 million in the prior period. See Equity and Dividends within this item for additional information.  Interest expense increased to $1.2 billion in 2017 compared to $1.1 billion in 2016. This increase was primarily due to the May 2016 issuances of long-term debt and borrowings under our commercial paper programs, which began in the second quarter of 2016.  Other expense/(income), net was an expense of $9 million in 2017 compared to income of $15 million in 2016. This increase was primarily due to a $36 million nonmonetary currency devaluation loss in the current period compared to $24 million in the prior period related to our Venezuelan operations. See Note 13, Venezuela - Foreign Currency and Inflation, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. 22 Adjusted EBITDA increased 1.9% to $7.9 billion in 2017 compared to 2016, primarily due to savings from the Integration Program and other restructuring activities and lower overhead costs, partially offset by higher input costs in local currency, a decline in Organic Net Sales, and the unfavorable impact of foreign currency (0.4pp). Segment Adjusted EBITDA results were as follows:  United States Segment Adjusted EBITDA increased primarily driven by Integration Program savings and lower overhead costs in the current period, partially offset by unfavorable key commodity costs, primarily in dairy, meat, and coffee, and volume/mix declines.  Europe Segment Adjusted EBITDA was flat primarily driven by productivity savings that were offset by higher input costs in local currency and the unfavorable impact of foreign currency (1.6 pp).  Rest of World Segment Adjusted EBITDA decreased primarily due to higher input costs in local currency, increased commercial investments, and the unfavorable impact of foreign currency (3.4 pp), partially offset by Organic Net Sales growth.  Canada Segment Adjusted EBITDA decreased primarily due to a decline in Organic Net Sales, partially offset by Integration Program savings, lower overhead costs in the current period, and the favorable impact of foreign currency (1.7 pp). Year Ended December 31, 2016 compared to the Year Ended January 3, 2016: Operating income increased 132.7% to $6.1 billion in 2016 compared to $2.6 billion in 2015. This increase was primarily driven by the 2015 Merger, as well as the following:  Savings from the Integration Program and other restructuring activities and favorable pricing net of key commodity costs in United States and Canada.  Non-cash costs of $347 million relating to the fair value adjustment of Kraft's inventory in purchase accounting in the prior period. The increase in operating income was partially offset by unfavorable impacts of $188 million from foreign currency and $62 million from a 53rd week of shipments in the prior period. Net income/(loss) attributable to common shareholders increased $3.7 billion to income of $3.5 billion in 2016 compared to a loss of $266 million in 2015. The increase was due to the growth in operating income, fewer Series A Preferred Stock dividend payments, lower other expense/(income), net, lower interest expense, and a lower effective tax rate, detailed as follows:  Series A Preferred Stock dividend cash distributions decreased to $180 million in 2016 compared to $900 million in 2015. This decrease was primarily due to the redemption of the Series A Preferred Stock on June 7, 2016. In addition, due to the December 8, 2015 common stock dividend declaration, we were required to accelerate payment of the March 7, 2016 preferred dividend to December 8, 2015. This resulted in one Series A Preferred Stock dividend payment in the current period compared to five in the prior period.  Other expense/(income), net improved to income of $15 million in 2016, compared to expense of $305 million in 2015. The decrease was primarily due to a $234 million nonmonetary currency devaluation loss related to our Venezuelan subsidiary in the prior period and call premiums of $105 million related to our 2015 debt refinancing activities.  Interest expense decreased to $1.1 billion in 2016 compared to $1.3 billion in 2015. This decrease was primarily due to a $236 million write-off of debt issuance costs related to 2015 debt refinancing activities and a $227 million loss released from accumulated other comprehensive income/(losses) due to the early termination of certain interest rate swaps in the prior period as well as lower interest rates following our debt refinancing in connection with the 2015 Merger. These were partially offset by the assumption of $8.6 billion aggregate principal amount of Kraft's long-term debt obligations in the 2015 Merger, the issuance of new long-term debt in conjunction with the redemption of our Series A Preferred Stock, and new borrowings under our commercial paper program. See Note 16, Debt, and Note 17, Capital Stock, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.  The effective tax rate was 27.5% in 2016, compared to 36.2% in 2015. The change in effective tax rate was primarily driven by higher earnings repatriation charges and the nondeductible nonmonetary currency devaluation loss related to our Venezuelan subsidiary in the prior period, partially offset by lower tax benefits associated with taxes on income of foreign subsidiaries, tax exempt income, and deferred tax effects of statutory rate changes in the current period. See Note 8, Income Taxes, to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of effective tax rates. 23 Adjusted EBITDA increased 15.4% to $7.8 billion in 2016 compared to 2015, primarily driven by savings from the Integration Program and other restructuring activities and favorable pricing net of key commodity costs, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign currency (3.4 pp) and a 53rd week of shipments in the prior period (approximately 1.5 pp). Segment Adjusted EBITDA results were as follows:  United States Segment Adjusted EBITDA growth was primarily driven by savings from the Integration Program and favorable pricing net of key commodity costs, partially offset by volume/mix declines and the impact of a 53rd week of shipments (approximately 1.5 pp) in the prior period.  Canada Segment Adjusted EBITDA growth was primarily driven by savings from the Integration Program and favorable pricing net of key commodity costs, partially offset by higher input costs in local currency, unfavorable impact of foreign currency (4.4 pp), and a 53rd week of shipments (approximately 1.5 pp) in the prior period.  Europe Segment Adjusted EBITDA decreased primarily due to unfavorable impact of foreign currency (6.5 pp), lower pricing, impact of a 53rd week of shipments (approximately 1.0 pp) in the prior period as well as an increase in marketing investments, partially offset by savings in manufacturing costs.  Rest of World Segment Adjusted EBITDA decreased due to unfavorable impact of foreign currency (17.4 pp), increased marketing investments, and a 53rd week of shipments (approximately 1.0 pp) in the prior period, partially offset by organic sales growth.

Adjusted EPS increased 52.1% to $3.33 in 2016 compared to $2.19 in 2015, primarily driven by Adjusted EBITDA growth despite the unfavorable impact of foreign currency, fewer Series A Preferred Stock dividends and a lower effective tax rate, partially offset by higher interest expense, higher other expense/(income), net, and a 53rd week of shipments in the prior period. Results of Operations by Segment Management evaluates segment performance based on several factors, including net sales, Organic Net Sales, and segment adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (""Segment Adjusted EBITDA""). Management uses Segment Adjusted EBITDA to evaluate segment performance and allocate resources. Segment Adjusted EBITDA is a tool that can assist management and investors in comparing our performance on a consistent basis by removing the impact of certain items that management believes do not directly reflect our underlying operations. These items include depreciation and amortization (excluding integration and restructuring expenses; including amortization of postretirement benefit plans prior service credits), equity award compensation expense, integration and restructuring expenses, merger costs, unrealized gains/(losses) on commodity hedges (the unrealized gains and losses are recorded in general corporate expenses until realized; once realized, the gains and losses are recorded in the applicable segment's operating results), impairment losses, gains/(losses) on the sale of a business, and nonmonetary currency devaluation (e.g., remeasurement gains and losses). In addition, consistent with the manner in which management evaluates segment performance and allocates resources, Segment Adjusted EBITDA includes the operating results of Kraft on a pro forma basis, as if Kraft had been acquired as of December 30, 2013. 25 Net Sales: December 30,  2017 (52 weeks)   December 31,  2016 (52 weeks)   January 3,  2016 (53 weeks)   (in millions) Net sales:           United States $ 18,353     $ 18,641     $ 10,943   Canada 2,190     2,309     1,437   Europe 2,393     2,366     2,656   Rest of World 3,296     3,171     3,302   Total net sales $ 26,232     $ 26,487     $ 18,338 Pro Forma Net Sales: December 30,  2017 (52 weeks)   December 31,  2016 (52 weeks)   January 3,  2016 (53 weeks)   (in millions) Pro forma net sales(a):           United States $ 18,353     $ 18,641     $ 18,932   Canada 2,190     2,309     2,386   Europe 2,393     2,366     2,657   Rest of World 3,296     3,171     3,472   Total pro forma net sales $ 26,232     $ 26,487     $ 27,447 (a) There were no pro forma adjustments for 2017 or 2016, as Kraft and Heinz were a combined company for these periods.

Year Ended December 30, 2017 compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2016: Net sales and Organic Net Sales decreased 1.5% to $18.4 billion due to unfavorable volume/mix (1.9 pp) partially offset by higher pricing (0.4 pp). Unfavorable volume/mix was primarily driven by distribution losses in nuts, cheese, and meat, and lower shipments in foodservice. The decline was partially offset by gains in refrigerated meal combinations, boxed dinners, and frozen meals. Pricing was higher driven primarily by price increases in cheese. Segment Adjusted EBITDA increased 2.4% primarily driven by Integration Program savings and lower overhead costs, partially offset by unfavorable key commodity costs, primarily in dairy, meat, and coffee, as well as unfavorable volume/mix. Year Ended December 31, 2016 compared to the Year Ended January 3, 2016: Net sales increased 70.3% to $18.6 billion primarily driven by the 2015 Merger. Pro forma net sales decreased 1.5% due to a 53rd week of shipments in the prior period (1.2 pp). Organic Net Sales decreased 0.3% due to unfavorable volume/mix (0.5 pp) partially offset by higher net pricing (0.2 pp). Unfavorable volume/mix was primarily due to declines in meat, foodservice, ready-to-drink beverages, and nuts that were partially offset by gains in coffee and innovation-related gains in refrigerated meal combinations and boxed dinners. Net pricing was higher despite deflation in key commodities, primarily in dairy, coffee, and meat. Segment Adjusted EBITDA increased 25.0% primarily due to savings from the Integration Program and favorable pricing net of key commodity costs, partially offset by volume/mix declines across several categories and the impact of a 53rd week of shipments (approximately 1.5 pp) in the prior period.

Year Ended December 30, 2017 compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2016: Net sales decreased 5.2% to $2.2 billion, including the favorable impact of foreign currency (1.8 pp). Organic Net Sales decreased 7.0% due to unfavorable volume/mix (5.3 pp) and lower pricing (1.7 pp). Volume/mix was unfavorable across several categories and was most pronounced in cheese, coffee, and boxed dinners, primarily due to delayed execution of go-to-market agreements with key retailers, retail distribution losses (primarily in cheese), and lower inventory levels at retail versus the prior year. Lower pricing was due to higher promotional activity, primarily in cheese. 28 Segment Adjusted EBITDA decreased 0.5%, including favorable impact of foreign currency (1.7 pp). Excluding the currency impact, Segment Adjusted EBITDA decreased primarily due to lower Organic Net Sales partially offset by Integration Program savings and lower overhead costs in the current period. Year Ended December 31, 2016 compared to the Year Ended January 3, 2016: Net sales increased 60.7% to $2.3 billion primarily driven by the 2015 Merger. Pro forma net sales decreased 3.2% due to the unfavorable impact of foreign currency (3.5 pp) and a 53rd week of shipments in the prior period (1.1 pp). Organic Net Sales increased 1.4% driven by favorable volume/mix (0.8 pp) and higher net pricing (0.6 pp). Favorable volume/mix reflected higher shipments of condiments and sauces and gains in foodservice that were partially offset by lower shipments in cheese versus the prior year. Price increases were driven by significant pricing actions taken to offset higher input costs in local currency. Segment Adjusted EBITDA increased 18.7% despite the unfavorable impact of foreign currency (4.4 pp). This increase was primarily driven by Integration Program savings and favorable pricing net of key commodity costs, partially offset by higher input costs in local currency and the impact of a 53rd week of shipments (approximately 1.5 pp) in the prior period.

Organic Net Sales increased 0.8% driven by favorable volume/mix (1.7 pp), partially offset by lower pricing (0.9 pp). Favorable volume/mix was primarily driven by higher shipments in foodservice and growth in condiments and sauces, partially offset by ongoing declines in infant nutrition in Italy. Lower pricing was primarily due to higher promotional activity in the UK and Italy versus the prior period. Segment Adjusted EBITDA was flat, including the unfavorable impact of foreign currency (1.6 pp). Excluding the currency impact, the increase was primarily driven by productivity savings, partially offset by higher input costs in local currency. Year Ended December 31, 2016 compared to the Year Ended January 3, 2016: Net sales decreased 10.9% to $2.4 billion, reflecting the unfavorable impacts of foreign currency, divestitures, and a 53rd week of shipments in the prior period. Pro forma net sales decreased 11.0% partially due to the unfavorable impacts of foreign currency (5.8 pp), divestitures (1.6 pp), and a 53rd week of shipments in the prior period (1.0 pp). Organic Net Sales decreased 2.6% due to lower net pricing (2.5 pp) and unfavorable volume/mix (0.1 pp). Lower net pricing was primarily due to increased promotional activity across most categories versus the prior period. Unfavorable volume/mix was primarily due to lower shipments across most categories in the UK partially offset by growth in condiments and sauces. Segment Adjusted EBITDA decreased 16.7% partially due to the unfavorable impact of foreign currency (6.5 pp). Excluding the currency impact, the Segment Adjusted EBITDA decline was primarily due to lower net pricing, the impact of a 53rd week of shipments (approximately 1.0 pp) in the prior period as well as an increase in marketing investments, partially offset by savings in manufacturing costs. 29 Rest of World: 2017 Compared to 2016   2016 Compared to 2015   December 30,  2017 (52 weeks)   December 31,  2016 (52 weeks)   % Change   December 31,  2016 (52 weeks)   January 3,  2016 (53 weeks)   % Change   (in millions)       (in millions)     Net sales $ 3,296     $ 3,171     3.9  %   $ 3,171     $ 3,302     (4.0 )% Pro forma net sales(a) 3,296     3,171     3.9  %   3,171     3,472     (8.7 )% Organic Net Sales(b) 3,283     3,116     5.4  %   3,263     3,082     5.9  % Segment Adjusted EBITDA 617     657     (6.1 )%   657     742     (11.5 )% (a) There were no pro forma adjustments for 2017 or 2016, as Kraft and Heinz were a combined company for these periods. See the Supplemental Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Information at the end of this item. (b) Organic Net Sales is a non-GAAP financial measure. See the Non-GAAP Financial Measures section at the end of this item. Year Ended December 30, 2017 compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2016: Net sales increased 3.9% to $3.3 billion despite the unfavorable impact of foreign currency (1.5 pp). Organic Net Sales increased 5.4% driven by higher pricing (4.6 pp) and favorable volume/mix (0.8 pp). Higher pricing was primarily driven by pricing actions taken to offset higher input costs in local currency, primarily in Latin America. Favorable volume/mix was primarily driven by growth in condiments and sauces across all regions partially offset by volume/mix declines in several markets associated with distributor network re-alignment. Segment Adjusted EBITDA decreased 6.1% including the unfavorable impact of foreign currency (3.4 pp). Excluding the currency impact, Segment Adjusted EBITDA decreased primarily due to higher input costs in local currency and higher commercial investments partially offset by Organic Net Sales growth. Year Ended December 31, 2016 compared to the Year Ended January 3, 2016: Net sales decreased 4.0% to $3.2 billion, reflecting the unfavorable impacts of foreign currency and a 53rd week of shipments in the prior period, which were partially offset by the inclusion of twelve months of the Kraft business in the current period. Pro forma net sales decreased 8.7% due to the unfavorable impacts of foreign currency (13.2 pp, including a 10.5 pp impact from the devaluation of the Venezuelan bolivar) and a 53rd week of shipments in the prior period (1.4 pp). Organic Net Sales increased 5.9% driven by higher net pricing (3.2 pp) and favorable volume/mix (2.7 pp). Higher net pricing was driven primarily by pricing actions to offset higher input costs in local currency, primarily in Latin America. Favorable volume/mix was primarily driven by growth in condiments and sauces across all regions, partially offset by declines in nutritional beverages in India. Segment Adjusted EBITDA decreased 11.5% primarily due to the unfavorable impact of foreign currency (17.4 pp, including a 14.0 pp impact from the devaluation of the Venezuelan bolivar). Excluding the currency impact, Segment Adjusted EBITDA increased, primarily driven by organic sales growth that was partially offset by increased marketing investments and a 53rd week of shipments (approximately 1.0 pp) in the prior period. Critical Accounting Policies Note 1, Background and Basis of Presentation, to the consolidated financial statements includes a summary of the significant accounting policies we used to prepare our consolidated financial statements. The following is a review of the more significant assumptions and estimates, as well as the accounting policies we used to prepare our consolidated financial statements. Principles of Consolidation: The consolidated financial statements include The Kraft Heinz Company, as well as our wholly-owned and majority-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany transactions are eliminated. Revenue Recognition: We recognize revenues when title and risk of loss pass to our customers. We record revenues net of consumer incentives and trade promotions and include all shipping and handling charges billed to customers. We also record provisions for estimated product returns and customer allowances as reductions to revenues within the same period that the revenue is recognized. We base these estimates principally on historical and current period experience factors. 30 Advertising, Consumer Incentives, and Trade Promotions: We promote our products with advertising, consumer incentives, and trade promotions. Consumer incentives and trade promotions include, but are not limited to, discounts, coupons, rebates, performance based in-store display activities, and volume-based incentives. Consumer incentive and trade promotion activities are recorded as a reduction to revenues based on amounts estimated as being due to customers and consumers at the end of a period. We base these estimates principally on historical utilization, redemption rates, or current period experience factors. We review and adjust these estimates each quarter based on actual experience and other information. Advertising expenses are recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses (""SG&A""). For interim reporting purposes, we charge advertising to operations as a percentage of estimated full year sales activity and marketing costs. We review and adjust these estimates each quarter based on actual experience and other information. We recorded advertising expenses of $629 million in 2017, $708 million in 2016, and $464 million in 2015. Goodwill and Intangible Assets: The carrying value of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets was $98.5 billion at December 30, 2017 and $97.4 billion at December 31, 2016. These balances are largely attributable to asset valuations performed in connection with the 2013 Merger and the 2015 Merger. See Note 2, Merger and Acquisition, and Note 7, Goodwill and Intangible Assets, for additional information. We test goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment at least annually in the second quarter or when a triggering event occurs. The first step of the goodwill impairment test compares the reporting unit's estimated fair value with its carrying value. If the carrying value of a reporting unit's net assets exceeds its fair value, the second step would be applied to measure the difference between the carrying value and implied fair value of goodwill. If the carrying value of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, the goodwill would be considered impaired and would be reduced to its implied fair value. We test indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment by comparing the fair value of each intangible asset with its carrying value. If the carrying value exceeds fair value, the intangible asset would be considered impaired and would be reduced to fair value. We performed our annual impairment testing in the second quarter of 2017. No impairment of goodwill was reported as a result of our 2017 annual goodwill impairment test. Each of our goodwill reporting units had excess fair value over its carrying value of at least 10% as of April 2, 2017 (our goodwill impairment testing date). Additionally, as a result of our annual indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment tests, we recognized a non-cash impairment loss of $49 million in SG&A in 2017. This loss was due to continued declines in nutritional beverages in India. The loss was recorded in our Europe segment as the related trademark is owned by our Italian subsidiary. Each of our other brands had excess fair value over its carrying value of at least 10% as of April 2, 2017. Fair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions, estimates and market factors. Estimating the fair value of individual reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets requires us to make assumptions and estimates regarding our future plans, as well as industry and economic conditions. These assumptions and estimates include projected revenues and income growth rates, terminal growth rates, competitive and consumer trends, market-based discount rates, and other market factors. If current expectations of future growth rates are not met or market factors outside of our control, such as discount rates, change significantly, then one or more of our reporting units or intangible assets might become impaired in the future. Additionally, as goodwill and intangible assets associated with recently acquired businesses are recorded on the balance sheet at their estimated acquisition date fair values, those amounts are more susceptible to an impairment risk if business operating results or macroeconomic conditions deteriorate. Definite-lived intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated periods benefited, and are reviewed when appropriate for possible impairment. 31 Postemployment Benefit Plans: We maintain various retirement plans for the majority of our employees. These include pension benefits, postretirement health care benefits, and defined contribution benefits. The cost of these plans is charged to expense over the working life of the covered employees. We generally amortize net actuarial gains or losses in future periods within cost of products sold and SG&A. For our postretirement benefit plans, our 2018 health care cost trend rate assumption will be 6.7%. We established this rate based upon our most recent experience as well as our expectation for health care trend rates going forward. We anticipate the weighted average assumed ultimate trend rate will be 4.9%. The year in which the ultimate trend rate is reached varies by plan, ranging between the years 2018 and 2030. Assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the health care plans. A one-percentage-point change in assumed health care cost trend rates would have had the following effects, increase/(decrease) in cost and obligation, as of December 30, 2017 (in millions): One-Percentage-Point   Increase   (Decrease) Effect on annual service and interest cost $ 4     $ (3 ) Effect on postretirement benefit obligation 55     (47 ) Our 2018 discount rate assumption will be 3.6% for service cost and 3.0% for interest cost for our postretirement plans. Our 2018 discount rate assumption will be 3.8% for service cost and 3.3% for interest cost for our U.S. pension plans and 3.0% for service cost and 2.2% for interest cost for our non-U.S. pension plans. We model these discount rates using a portfolio of high quality, fixed-income debt instruments with durations that match the expected future cash flows of the plans. Changes in our discount rates were primarily the result of changes in bond yields year-over-year. In 2016, we changed the method we use to estimate the service cost and interest cost components of net pension cost/(benefit) and net postretirement benefit plan costs resulting in a decrease to these cost components. We now use a full yield curve approach to estimate service cost and interest cost by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used to determine the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows. Previously, we estimated service cost and interest cost using a single weighted-average discount rate derived from the yield curve used to measure the benefit obligation at the beginning of the period. We made this change to provide a more precise measurement of service cost and interest cost by improving the correlation between projected benefit cash flows and the corresponding spot yield curve rates. This change will not affect the measurement of our total benefit obligations. We accounted for this change prospectively as a change in accounting estimate. Our 2018 expected return on plan assets will be 4.4% (net of applicable taxes) for our postretirement plans. Our 2018 expected rate of return on plan assets will be 5.5% for our U.S. pension plans and 4.5% for our non-U.S. pension plans. We determine our expected rate of return on plan assets from the plan assets' historical long-term investment performance, current and future asset allocation, and estimates of future long-term returns by asset class. We attempt to maintain our target asset allocation by re-balancing between asset classes as we make contributions and monthly benefit payments. While we do not anticipate further changes in the 2018 assumptions for our U.S. and non-U.S. pension and postretirement benefit plans, as a sensitivity measure, a 100-basis point change in our discount rate or a 100-basis-point change in the expected rate of return on plan assets would have had the following effects, increase/(decrease) in cost (in millions): U.S. Plans   Non-U.S. Plans   100-Basis-Point   100-Basis-Point   Increase   Decrease   Increase   Decrease Effect of change in discount rate on pension costs $ 9     $ (19 )   $ 8     $ (21 ) Effect of change in expected rate of return on plan assets on pension costs (46 )   46     (41 )   41   Effect of change in discount rate on postretirement costs (4 )   (9 )    -      (1 ) Effect of change in expected rate of return on plan assets on postretirement costs (11 )   11      -       - 32 Income Taxes: We compute our annual tax rate based on the statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we earn income. Significant judgment is required in determining our annual tax rate and in evaluating the uncertainty of our tax positions. We recognize a benefit for tax positions that we believe will more likely than not be sustained upon examination. The amount of benefit recognized is the largest amount of benefit that we believe has more than a 50% probability of being realized upon settlement. We regularly monitor our tax positions and adjust the amount of recognized tax benefit based on our evaluation of information that has become available since the end of our last financial reporting period. The annual tax rate includes the impact of these changes in recognized tax benefits. When adjusting the amount of recognized tax benefits, we do not consider information that has become available after the balance sheet date, however we do disclose the effects of new information whenever those effects would be material to our financial statements. Unrecognized tax benefits represent the difference between the amount of benefit taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and the amount of benefit recognized for financial reporting. These unrecognized tax benefits are recorded primarily within other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. We record valuation allowances to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. When assessing the need for valuation allowances, we consider future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. Should a change in circumstances lead to a change in judgment about the realizability of deferred tax assets in future years, we would adjust related valuation allowances in the period that the change in circumstances occurs, along with a corresponding increase or charge to income. The resolution of tax reserves and changes in valuation allowances could be material to our results of operations for any period but is not expected to be material to our financial position. U.S. Tax Reform significantly changed U.S. tax law by, among other things, lowering the federal corporate tax rate from 35.0% to 21.0%, effective January 1, 2018, implementing a territorial tax system, and imposing a one-time toll charge on deemed repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries as of December 30, 2017. In addition, there are many new provisions, including changes to bonus depreciation, the deduction for executive compensation and interest expense, a tax on global intangible low-taxed income provisions (""GILTI""), the base erosion anti-abuse tax (""BEAT""), and a deduction for foreign-derived intangible income (""FDII""). The two material items that impacted us in 2017 were the corporate tax rate reduction and the one-time toll charge. While the corporate tax rate reduction is effective January 1, 2018, we accounted for this anticipated rate change in 2017, the period of enactment. The SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (""SAB 118""), which provides us with up to one year to finalize accounting for the impacts of U.S. Tax Reform. When the initial accounting for U.S Tax Reform impacts is incomplete, we may include provisional amounts when reasonable estimates can be made or continue to apply the prior tax law if a reasonable estimate cannot be made. We have estimated the provisional tax impacts related to the toll charge, certain components of the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, including depreciation and executive compensation, and the change in our indefinite reinvestment assertion. As a result, we recognized a net tax benefit of approximately $7.0 billion, including a reasonable estimate of our deferred income tax benefit of approximately $7.5 billion related to the corporate rate change, which was partially offset by a reasonable estimate of $312 million for the toll charge and approximately $125 million for other tax expenses, including a change in our indefinite reinvestment assertion. We have elected to account for the tax on GILTI as a period cost and thus have not adjusted any of the deferred tax assets and liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries for U.S. Tax Reform. The ultimate impact may differ from these provisional amounts due to gathering additional information to more precisely compute the amount of tax, changes in interpretations and assumptions, additional regulatory guidance that may be issued, and actions we may take. We expect to finalize accounting for the impacts of U.S. Tax Reform when the 2017 U.S. corporate income tax return is filed in 2018. In connection with U.S. Tax Reform, we have also reassessed our international investment assertions and no longer consider the historic earnings of our foreign subsidiaries as of December 30, 2017 to be indefinitely reinvested. We have made a reasonable estimate of local country withholding taxes that would be owed when our historic earnings are distributed. As a result, we have recorded deferred income taxes of $96 million on approximately $1.2 billion of historic earnings. New Accounting Pronouncements See Note 1, Background and Basis of Presentation, to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of new accounting pronouncements. Contingencies See Note 15, Commitments and Contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our contingencies. 33 Commodity Trends We purchase and use large quantities of commodities, including dairy products, meat products, coffee beans, nuts, tomatoes, potatoes, soybean and vegetable oils, sugar and other sweeteners, corn products, and wheat to manufacture our products. In addition, we purchase and use significant quantities of resins, metals, and cardboard to package our products and natural gas to operate our facilities. We continuously monitor worldwide supply and cost trends of these commodities. We define our key commodities in the United States and Canada as dairy, meat, coffee, and nuts. In 2017, we experienced cost increases in our key commodities, including dairy, meat, and coffee, while costs for nuts were flat. We manage commodity cost volatility primarily through pricing and risk management strategies. As a result of these risk management strategies, our commodity costs may not immediately correlate with market price trends. Dairy commodities, primarily milk and cheese, are the most significant cost components of our cheese products. We purchase our dairy raw material requirements from independent third parties, such as agricultural cooperatives and independent processors. Market supply and demand, as well as government programs, significantly influence the prices for milk and other dairy products. Significant cost components in our meat business include pork, beef, and poultry, which we primarily purchase from applicable local markets. Livestock feed costs and the global supply and demand for U.S. meats influence the prices of these meat products. The most significant cost component of our coffee products is coffee beans, which we purchase on global markets. Quality and availability of supply, currency fluctuations, and consumer demand for coffee products impact coffee bean prices. The most significant cost components in our nut products include peanuts, cashews, and almonds, which we purchase on both domestic and global markets, where global market supply and demand is the primary driver of prices. Liquidity and Capital Resources We believe that cash generated from our operating activities, securitization programs, commercial paper programs, and Senior Credit Facility (as defined below) will provide sufficient liquidity to meet our working capital needs, restructuring expenditures, planned capital expenditures, contributions to our postemployment benefit plans, future contractual obligations (including repayments of long-term debt), and payment of our anticipated quarterly common stock dividends. We intend to use our cash on hand and our commercial paper programs for daily funding requirements. Overall, we do not expect any negative effects on our funding sources that would have a material effect on our short-term or long-term liquidity. Cash Flow Activity for 2017 compared to 2016: Net Cash Provided by/Used for Operating Activities: Net cash provided by operating activities was $527 million for the year ended December 30, 2017 compared to $2.6 billion for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in cash provided by operating activities was primarily driven by the $1.2 billion pre-funding of our postretirement benefit plans in 2017, lower collections on receivables as more were non-cash exchanged for sold receivables, favorable changes in accounts payable from vendor payment term renegotiations that were less pronounced than the prior year, and increased cash payments of employee bonuses in 2017. The decrease in cash provided by operating activities was partially offset by lower cash payments for income taxes in 2017 driven by our pre-funding of postretirement plan benefits following U.S. Tax Reform enactment on December 22, 2017. Net Cash Provided by/Used for Investing Activities: Net cash provided by investing activities was $1.2 billion for the year ended December 30, 2017 compared to $1.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in cash provided by investing activities was primarily due to lower cash inflows from our accounts receivable securitization and factoring programs, as well as lower proceeds from cash settlements on net investment hedges. Capital expenditures were flat in 2017 compared to 2016. We expect 2018 capital expenditures to be approximately $850 million. The expected decrease is primarily attributed to the wind-up of footprint costs in the U.S. and Canada related to our Integration Program. Net Cash Provided by/Used for Financing Activities: Net cash used for financing activities was $4.2 billion for the year ended December 30, 2017 compared to $4.6 billion for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease was driven by the benefit of fewer dividend payments in 2017 compared to 2016, which more than offset higher net repayments of long-term debt and commercial paper in 2017 compared to 2016, including cash outflows associated with the redemption of our Series A Preferred Stock in 2016. Dividend payments were lower in 2017 compared to 2016 due to the absence of the Series A Preferred Stock dividend and the impact of four common stock cash distributions in 2017 compared to five such distributions in 2016. See Equity and Dividends for additional information on cash distributions related to common stock and Series A Preferred Stock. 34 Cash Flow Activity for 2016 compared to 2015: Net Cash Provided by/Used for Operating Activities: Net cash provided by operating activities was $2.6 billion in 2016 compared to $1.3 billion in 2015. The increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to an increase in operating income as a result of the 2015 Merger, as well as favorable changes in accounts payable due to payment term extensions from vendor renegotiations. The increase in cash provided by operating activities was partially offset by lower collections on receivables as more were non-cash exchanged for sold receivables, as well as unfavorable changes in other current liabilities, and to a lesser degree, inventories. The change in other current liabilities was primarily driven by increased payments in 2016 related to income taxes. Net Cash Provided by/Used for Investing Activities: Net cash provided by investing activities was $1.5 billion in 2016 compared to net cash used for investing activities of $8.3 billion in 2015. The change was primarily driven by increased cash inflows from our accounts receivable securitization and factoring programs, partially offset by an increase in capital expenditures and lower proceeds from cash settlements on net investment hedges. Capital expenditures increased to $1.2 billion in 2016 primarily due to integration and restructuring activities in the United States. The change also reflected cash paid to acquire Kraft in 2015. See Note 2, Merger and Acquisition, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on the 2015 Merger. Net Cash Provided by/Used for Financing Activities: Net cash used for financing activities was $4.6 billion in 2016 compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $10.0 billion in 2015. This decrease in cash provided by financing activities was primarily driven by proceeds of $10.0 billion from our issuance of common stock to the Sponsors in connection with the 2015 Merger, the Series A Preferred Stock redemption in June 2016, and the impact of five common stock cash distributions in 2016 compared to two such cash distributions in 2015. The decrease in cash provided by financing activities was partially offset by net proceeds from our long-term debt issuances in May 2016 and net proceeds from our issuance of commercial paper, which were our primary sources of funding for the Series A Preferred Stock redemption. Additionally, in the prior year we had a benefit from proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt, which were largely offset by repayments of long-term debt. Our cash used for financing activities in 2016 also reflected the impact of one cash distribution related to our Series A Preferred Stock in 2016 compared to five such cash distributions in 2015. See Equity and Dividends within this item for additional information on cash distributions related to common stock and Series A Preferred Stock. Cash Held by International Subsidiaries: Of the $1.6 billion cash and cash equivalents on our consolidated balance sheet at December 30, 2017, $1.1 billion was held by international subsidiaries. In the future, we could repatriate up to approximately $6.5 billion of international cash to the U.S. without incurring any additional significant income tax expense. Our approximately $5.0 billion of unremitted historic earnings of our foreign subsidiaries was taxed via the U.S. Tax Reform toll charge in 2017. In connection with U.S. Tax Reform, we have also reassessed our international investment assertions and no longer consider these earnings to be indefinitely reinvested. We have made a reasonable estimate of local country withholding taxes that would be owed when our historic earnings are distributed. As a result, we have recorded an estimate of $96 million related to deferred income taxes to reflect local country withholding taxes that will be owed when this cash is distributed. The remaining amount of up to approximately $1.5 billion represents intercompany loans and previously taxed income which could be repatriated to the U.S. without incurring any additional significant income tax expense. Total Debt: In 2017, we obtained funding through our U.S. and European commercial paper programs. As of December 30, 2017, we had $448 million of commercial paper outstanding, with a weighted average interest rate of 1.541%. As of December 31, 2016, we had $642 million of commercial paper outstanding, with a weighted average interest rate of 1.074%. The maximum amount of commercial paper outstanding during the year ended December 30, 2017 was $1.2 billion. We maintain our $4.0 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility (the ""Senior Credit Facility""). Subject to certain conditions, we may increase the amount of revolving commitments and/or add additional tranches of term loans in a combined aggregate amount of up to $1.0 billion. Our Senior Credit Facility contains customary representations, covenants, and events of default. No amounts were drawn on our Senior Credit Facility at December 30, 2017, at December 31, 2016, or during the years ended December 30, 2017, December 31, 2016, and January 3, 2016. In August 2017, we repaid $600 million aggregate principal amount of our previously outstanding senior unsecured loan facility (the ""Term Loan Facility""). Accordingly, there were no amounts outstanding on the Term Loan Facility at December 30, 2017. At December 31, 2016, $600 million aggregate principal amount of our Term Loan Facility was outstanding. 35 Our long-term debt, including the current portion, was $31.1 billion at December 30, 2017 and $31.8 billion at December 31, 2016. The decrease in long-term debt was primarily due to our June 2017 repayment of approximately $2.0 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes that matured in the period and our August 2017 repayment of the $600 million aggregate principal amount Term Loan Facility. The decrease was partially offset by approximately $1.5 billion aggregate principal amount of long-term debt issued in August 2017. Our long-term debt contains customary representations, covenants, and events of default. We were in compliance with all such covenants at December 30, 2017. See Note 16, Debt, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. We have approximately $2.5 billion aggregate principal amount and $C200 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes that will mature in the third quarter of 2018. We expect to fund these long-term debt repayments primarily with new long-term debt issuances, cash on hand, and cash generated from our operating activities. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Aggregate Contractual Obligations Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements: We do not have guarantees or other off-balance sheet financing arrangements that we believe are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenue or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources. See Note 14, Financing Arrangements, to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our accounts receivable securitization and factoring programs and other financing arrangements. Aggregate Contractual Obligations: The following table summarizes our contractual obligations at December 30, 2017 (in millions): Payments Due   2018   2019-2020   2021-2022   2023 and Thereafter   Total Long-term debt(a) 3,939     5,653     6,200     32,779     48,571   Capital leases(b) 35     34     64     1     134   Operating leases(c) 103     164     99     165     531   Purchase obligations(d) 1,558     1,251     446     439     3,694   Other long-term liabilities(e) 80     106     94     280     560   Total 5,715     7,208     6,903     33,664     53,490 (a)  Amounts represent the expected cash payments of our long-term debt, including interest on variable and fixed rate long-term debt. Interest on variable rate long-term debt is calculated based on interest rates at December 30, 2017. (b)  Amounts represent the expected cash payments of our capital leases, including expected cash payments of interest expense. (c)  Operating leases represent the minimum rental commitments under non-cancelable operating leases. (d)  We have purchase obligations for materials, supplies, property, plant and equipment, and co-packing, storage and distribution services based on projected needs to be utilized in the normal course of business. Other purchase obligations include commitments for marketing, advertising, capital expenditures, information technology, and professional services. Arrangements are considered purchase obligations if a contract specifies all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased, a pricing structure, and approximate timing of the transaction. A few of these obligations are long-term and are based on minimum purchase requirements. Certain purchase obligations contain variable pricing components, and, as a result, actual cash payments are expected to fluctuate based on changes in these variable components. Due to the proprietary nature of some of our materials and processes, certain supply contracts contain penalty provisions for early terminations. We do not believe that a material amount of penalties is reasonably likely to be incurred under these contracts based upon historical experience and current expectations. We exclude amounts reflected on the consolidated balance sheet as accounts payable and accrued liabilities from the table above. (e) Other long-term liabilities primarily consist of estimated payments for the one-time toll charge related to U.S. tax reform, as well as postretirement benefit commitments. Certain other long-term liabilities related to income taxes, insurance accruals, and other accruals included on the consolidated balance sheet are excluded from the above table as we are unable to estimate the timing of payments for these items. Future payments related to other long-term liabilities decreased primarily due to payments of $1.2 billion in 2017 to pre-fund a portion of our U.S. postretirement plan benefits. See Note 10, Postemployment Benefits, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. During the second quarter of 2016, we redeemed all outstanding shares of our Series A Preferred Stock, therefore we no longer pay Series A Preferred Stock dividends. See Note 17, Capital Stock, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. 36 Pension plan contributions were $330 million in 2017. We estimate that 2018 pension plan contributions will be approximately $50 million. Beyond 2018, we are unable to reliably estimate the timing of contributions to our pension plans. Our actual contributions and plans may change due to many factors, including the timing of regulatory approval for the windup of certain non-U.S. pension plans, changes in tax, employee benefit, or other laws and regulations, tax deductibility, significant differences between expected and actual pension asset performance or interest rates, or other factors. As such, estimated pension plan contributions for 2018 have been excluded from the above table. Postretirement benefit plan contributions were $1.3 billion in 2017, including payments of $1.2 billion to pre-fund a portion of our U.S. postretirement plan benefits following enactment of U.S. Tax Reform on December 22, 2017. We estimate that 2018 postretirement benefit plan contributions will be approximately $15 million. Beyond 2018, we are unable to reliably estimate the timing of contributions to our postretirement benefit plans. Our actual contributions and plans may change due to many factors, including changes in tax, employee benefit, or other laws and regulations, tax deductibility, significant differences between expected and actual postretirement plan asset performance or interest rates, or other factors. As such, estimated postretirement benefit plan contributions for 2018 have been excluded from the above table. At December 30, 2017, the amount of net unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions, including an accrual of related interest and penalties along with positions only impacting the timing of tax benefits, was approximately $428 million. The timing of payments will depend on the progress of examinations with tax authorities. We do not expect a significant tax payment related to these obligations within the next year. We are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate as to if or when any significant cash settlements with taxing authorities may occur; therefore, we have excluded the amount of net unrecognized tax benefits from the above table. Equity and Dividends Series A Preferred Stock Dividends: On June 7, 2016, we redeemed all outstanding shares of our Series A Preferred Stock. Accordingly, we no longer pay any associated dividends, and there were no such dividend payments in 2017. Prior to the redemption, we made cash distributions of $180 million in the second quarter of 2016 compared to $900 million in 2015. Our Series A Preferred Stock entitled holders to a 9.00% annual dividend, to be paid in four dividends, in arrears on each March 7, June 7, and December 7, in cash. In 2015, there were five dividend payments because, concurrent with the declaration of our common stock dividend on December 8, 2015, we also declared and paid the Series A Preferred Stock dividend that would otherwise have been payable on March 7, 2016. Accordingly, there were no cash distributions related to our Series A Preferred Stock in the first quarter of 2016, resulting in only one dividend payment in 2016 prior to redemption. See Note 17, Capital Stock, to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the Series A Preferred Stock. Common Stock Dividends: We paid common stock dividends of $2.9 billion in 2017, $3.6 billion in 2016, and $1.3 billion in 2015. Additionally, on February 16, 2018, our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.625 per share of common stock, which is payable on March 23, 2018 to shareholders of record on March 9, 2018. The declaration of dividends is subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors and depends on various factors, including our net income, financial condition, cash requirements, future prospects, and other factors that our Board of Directors deems relevant to its analysis and decision making. 37 Supplemental Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Information The following unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information is presented to illustrate the estimated effects of the 2015 Merger, which was consummated on July 2, 2015, and the related equity investments, based on the historical results of operations of Heinz and Kraft. See Note 1, Background and Basis of Presentation, and Note 2, Merger and Acquisition, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on the 2015 Merger. The following unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of income for the year ended January 3, 2016 is based on the historical financial statements of Heinz and Kraft after giving effect to the 2015 Merger, related equity investments, and the assumptions and adjustments described in the accompanying notes to this unaudited pro forma condensed combined statement of income. The Kraft Heinz statement of income information for the year ended January 3, 2016 was derived from the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K. The historical Kraft statement of income includes information for the six months ended June 27, 2015 derived from Kraft's unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in our Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on July 7, 2016 and information for the period from June 27, 2015 to July 2, 2015 derived from Kraft's books and records. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of income are presented as if the 2015 Merger had been consummated on December 30, 2013, the first business day of our 2014 fiscal year, and combine the historical results of Heinz and Kraft. This is consistent with internal management reporting. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of income set forth below primarily give effect to the following assumptions and adjustments:  Application of the acquisition method of accounting;  The issuance of Heinz common stock to the Sponsors in connection with the equity investments;  The pre-closing Heinz share conversion;  The exchange of one share of Kraft Heinz common stock for each share of Kraft common stock; and  Conformance of accounting policies. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information was prepared using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires, among other things, that assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination be recognized at their fair values as of the completion of the acquisition. We utilized estimated fair values at the 2015 Merger Date to allocate the total consideration exchanged to the net tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed. This allocation was final as of July 3, 2016. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information has been prepared in accordance with SEC Regulation S-X Article 11 and is not necessarily indicative of the results of operations that would have been realized had the transactions been completed as of the dates indicated, nor are they meant to be indicative of our anticipated combined future results. In addition, the accompanying unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of income do not reflect any additional anticipated synergies, operating efficiencies, cost savings, or any integration costs that may result from the 2015 Merger. The historical consolidated financial information has been adjusted in the accompanying unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of income to give effect to unaudited pro forma events that are (1) directly attributable to the transaction, (2) factually supportable and (3) are expected to have a continuing impact on the results of operations of the combined company. As a result, under SEC Regulation S-X Article 11, certain expenses such as deal costs and non-cash costs related to the fair value step-up of inventory (""Inventory Step-up Costs""), if applicable, are eliminated from pro forma results in the periods presented. In contrast, under the ASC 805 presentation in Note 2, Merger and Acquisition, to the consolidated financial statements, these expenses are required to be included in prior year pro forma results. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information, including the related notes, should be read in conjunction with the historical consolidated financial statements and related notes of Kraft, and with our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K. The historical SEC filings of Kraft are available to the public at the SEC's website at www.sec.gov. 38 The Kraft Heinz Company Pro Forma Condensed Combined Statements of Income For the Year Ended January 3, 2016 (in millions, except per share data) (Unaudited)  Kraft Heinz    Historical Kraft   Pro Forma Adjustments   Pro Forma Net sales $ 18,338     $ 9,109     $  -      $ 27,447   Cost of products sold 12,577     6,103     (381 )   18,299   Gross profit 5,761     3,006     381     9,148   Selling, general and administrative expenses 3,122     1,532     (41 )   4,613   Operating income 2,639     1,474     422     4,535   Interest expense 1,321     247     (40 )   1,528   Other expense/(income), net 305     (16 )    -      289   Income/(loss) before income taxes 1,013     1,243     462     2,718   Provision for/(benefit from) income taxes 366     400     178     944   Net income/(loss) 647     843     284     1,774   Net income/(loss) attributable to noncontrolling interest 13      -       -      13   Net income/(loss) attributable to Kraft Heinz 634     843     284     1,761   Preferred dividends 900      -       -      900   Net income/(loss) attributable to common shareholders $ (266 )   $ 843     $ 284     $ 861                   Basic common shares outstanding 786      -      416     1,202   Diluted common shares outstanding 786      -      436     1,222                   Per share data applicable to common shareholders:               Basic earnings/(loss) $ (0.34 )   $  -      $ 1.06     $ 0.72   Diluted earnings/(loss) (0.34 )    -      1.04     0.70 39 The Kraft Heinz Company Summary of Pro Forma Adjustments (in millions) (Unaudited)   January 3,  2016 (53 weeks) Impact to cost of products sold:   Postemployment benefit costs(a) $ (34 ) Inventory step-up(b) (347 ) Impact to cost of products sold $ (381 )     Impact to selling, general and administrative expenses:   Depreciation and amortization(c) $ 84   Compensation expense(d) 31   Postemployment benefit costs(a) 11   Deal costs(e) (167 ) Impact to selling, general and administrative expenses $ (41 )     Impact to interest expense:   Interest expense(f) $ (40 ) Impact to interest expense $ (40 ) Adjustments included in the accompanying unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of income are as follows: (a)  Represents the change to align Kraft's accounting policy to our accounting policy for postemployment benefit plans. Kraft historically elected a mark-to-market accounting policy and recognized net actuarial gains or losses and changes in the fair value of plan assets immediately in earnings upon remeasurement. Our policy is to initially record such items in other comprehensive income/(loss). Also represents the elimination of Kraft's historical amortization of postemployment benefit plan prior service credits. (b) Represents the elimination of nonrecurring non-cash costs related to the fair value adjustment of Kraft's inventory. See Note 2, Merger and Acquisition, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on the determination of fair values. (c)  Represents incremental amortization resulting from the fair value adjustment of Kraft's definite-lived intangible assets in connection with the 2015 Merger. The net change in depreciation expense resulting from the fair value adjustment of property, plant, and equipment was insignificant. See Note 2, Merger and Acquisition, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on the determination of fair values. (d)  Represents the incremental compensation expense due to the fair value remeasurement of certain of Kraft's equity awards in connection with the 2015 Merger. See Note 9, Employees' Stock Incentive Plans, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on the conversion of Kraft's equity awards in connection with the 2015 Merger. (e)  Represents the elimination of non-recurring deal costs incurred in connection with the 2015 Merger. (f)  Represents the incremental change in interest expense resulting from the fair value adjustment of Kraft's long-term debt in connection with the 2015 Merger, including the elimination of the historical amortization of deferred financing fees and amortization of original issuance discount. We calculated the income tax effect of the pro forma adjustments using a 38.5% weighted average statutory tax rate for the periods presented. Additionally, for 2015, we calculated the unaudited pro forma weighted average number of basic shares outstanding by adding the Kraft Heinz weighted average number of basic shares outstanding (which included the Sponsors' shares and the converted Kraft shares weighted for the period from the 2015 Merger through the year ended January 3, 2016) and the Sponsors' shares (as converted) and the converted Kraft shares (both weighted from the beginning of the year through the 2015 Merger Date). We calculated the unaudited pro forma weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding by adding the effect of dilutive securities to the unaudited pro forma weighted average number of basic shares outstanding, including dilutive securities related to Kraft Heinz. The Kraft Heinz diluted EPS calculation did not include these securities as Kraft Heinz was in a net loss position and such securities were anti-dilutive. 40 Non-GAAP Financial Measures The non-GAAP financial measures we provide in this report should be viewed in addition to, and not as an alternative for, results prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (""U.S. GAAP""). To supplement the consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, we have presented Organic Net Sales, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted EPS, which are considered non-GAAP financial measures. The non-GAAP financial measures presented may differ from similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures presented by other companies, and other companies may not define these non-GAAP financial measures in the same way. These measures are not substitutes for their comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures, such as net sales, net income/(loss), diluted earnings per common share (""EPS""), or other measures prescribed by U.S. GAAP, and there are limitations to using non-GAAP financial measures. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures to assist in comparing our performance on a consistent basis for purposes of business decision making by removing the impact of certain items that management believes do not directly reflect our underlying operations. Management believes that presenting our non-GAAP financial measures (i.e., Organic Net Sales, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted EPS) is useful to investors because it (i) provides investors with meaningful supplemental information regarding financial performance by excluding certain items, (ii) permits investors to view performance using the same tools that management uses to budget, make operating and strategic decisions, and evaluate historical performance, and (iii) otherwise provides supplemental information that may be useful to investors in evaluating our results. We believe that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures, when considered together with the corresponding U.S. GAAP financial measures and the reconciliations to those measures, provides investors with additional understanding of the factors and trends affecting our business than could be obtained absent these disclosures. Organic Net Sales is defined as net sales excluding, when they occur, the impact of acquisitions, currency, divestitures, and a 53rd week of shipments. We calculate the impact of currency on net sales by holding exchange rates constant at the previous year's exchange rate, with the exception of Venezuela following our June 28, 2015 currency devaluation, for which we calculate the previous year's results using the current year's exchange rate. Organic Net Sales for any period prior to the 2015 Merger Date includes the operating results of Kraft on a pro forma basis, as if Kraft had been acquired as of December 30, 2013. Organic Net Sales is a tool that can assist management and investors in comparing our performance on a consistent basis by removing the impact of certain items that management believes do not directly reflect our underlying operations. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income/(loss) from continuing operations before interest expense, other expense/(income), net, and provision for/(benefit from) income taxes; in addition to these adjustments, we exclude, when they occur, the impacts of depreciation and amortization (excluding integration and restructuring expenses; including amortization of postretirement benefit plans prior service credits), integration and restructuring expenses, merger costs, unrealized losses/(gains) on commodity hedges, impairment losses, losses/(gains) on the sale of a business, nonmonetary currency devaluation (e.g., remeasurement gains and losses), and equity award compensation expense (excluding integration and restructuring expenses). Adjusted EBITDA for any period prior to the 2015 Merger Date includes the operating results of Kraft on a pro forma basis, as if Kraft had been acquired as of December 30, 2013. Adjusted EBITDA is a tool that can assist management and investors in comparing our performance on a consistent basis by removing the impact of certain items that management believes do not directly reflect our underlying operations. Adjusted EPS is defined as diluted earnings per share excluding, when they occur, the impacts of integration and restructuring expenses, merger costs, unrealized losses/(gains) on commodity hedges, impairment losses, losses/(gains) on the sale of a business, nonmonetary currency devaluation (e.g., remeasurement gains and losses), and U.S. Tax Reform, and including, when they occur, adjustments to reflect preferred stock dividend payments on an accrual basis. Adjusted EPS for any period prior to the 2015 Merger Date includes the operating results of Kraft on a pro forma basis, as if Kraft had been acquired as of December 30, 2013. We believe Adjusted EPS provides important comparability of underlying operating results, allowing investors and management to assess operating performance on a consistent basis. 41 The Kraft Heinz Company Reconciliation of Net Sales to Organic Net Sales (dollars in millions) (Unaudited) Net Sales   Impact of Currency   Organic Net Sales   Price   Volume/Mix 2017 (52 weeks)                   United States $ 18,353     $  -      $ 18,353           Canada 2,190     42     2,148           Europe 2,393     8     2,385           Rest of World 3,296     13     3,283             $ 26,232     $ 63     $ 26,169                               2016 (52 weeks)                   United States $ 18,641     $  -      $ 18,641           Canada 2,309      -      2,309           Europe 2,366      -      2,366           Rest of World 3,171     55     3,116             $ 26,487     $ 55     $ 26,432 Year-over-year growth rates                   United States (1.5 )%   0.0 pp   (1.5 )%   0.4 pp   (1.9) pp Canada (5.2 )%   1.8 pp   (7.0 )%   (1.7) pp   (5.3) pp Europe 1.1  %   0.3 pp   0.8  %   (0.9) pp   1.7 pp Rest of World 3.9  %   (1.5) pp   5.4  %   4.6 pp   0.8 pp Kraft Heinz (1.0 )%   0.0 pp   (1.0 )%   0.5 pp   (1.5) pp 42 The Kraft Heinz Company Reconciliation of Pro Forma Net Sales to Organic Net Sales (dollars in millions) (Unaudited) Pro Forma Net Sales(a)   Impact of Currency   Impact of Divestitures   Impact of 53rd Week   Organic Net Sales   Price   Volume/Mix 2016 (52 weeks)                           United States $ 18,641     $  -      $  -      $  -      $ 18,641           Canada 2,309     (84 )    -       -      2,393           Europe 2,366     (154 )    -       -      2,520           Rest of World 3,171     (92 )    -       -      3,263             $ 26,487     $ (330 )   $  -      $  -      $ 26,817                                       2015 (53 weeks)                           United States $ 18,932     $  -      $  -      $ 233     $ 18,699           Canada 2,386      -       -      27     2,359           Europe 2,657      -      42     27     2,588           Rest of World 3,472     351      -      39     3,082             $ 27,447     $ 351     $ 42     $ 326     $ 26,728 Year-over-year growth rates                           United States (1.5 )%   0.0 pp   0.0 pp   (1.2) pp   (0.3 )%   0.2 pp   (0.5) pp Canada (3.2 )%   (3.5) pp   0.0 pp   (1.1) pp   1.4  %   0.6 pp   0.8 pp Europe (11.0 )%   (5.8) pp   (1.6) pp   (1.0) pp   (2.6 )%   (2.5) pp   (0.1) pp Rest of World (8.7 )%   (13.2) pp   0.0 pp   (1.4) pp   5.9  %   3.2 pp   2.7 pp Kraft Heinz (3.5 )%   (2.5) pp   (0.1) pp   (1.2) pp   0.3  %   0.3 pp   0.0 pp (a)  There were no pro forma adjustments for 2016, as Kraft and Heinz were a combined company for the entire period.

(b) Income tax expense associated with these items is based on applicable jurisdictional tax rates and deductibility assessments of individual items. (c) Refer to the reconciliation of pro forma net income/(loss) to Adjusted EBITDA for the related gross expenses. (d)  Merger costs included the following gross expenses:  Expenses recorded in cost of products sold were $2 million in 2016 and $6 million in 2015 (there were no such expenses in 2017);  Expenses recorded in SG&A were $28 million in 2016 and $188 million in 2015 (there were no such expenses in 2017);  Expenses recorded in interest expense were $466 million in 2015 (there were no such expenses in 2017 or 2016); and,  Expenses recorded in other expense/(income), net, were $144 million in 2015 (there were no such expenses in 2017 or 2016). (e) Nonmonetary currency devaluation included the following gross expenses:  Expenses recorded in cost of products sold were $4 million in 2016 and $57 million in 2015 (there were no such expenses in 2017); and  Expenses recorded in other expense/(income), net, were $36 million in 2017, $24 million in 2016, and $234 million in 2015. (f) For Adjusted EPS, we present the impact of the Series A Preferred Stock dividend payments on an accrual basis. Accordingly, we included adjustments to EPS to exclude $180 million of Series A Preferred Stock dividends from the fourth quarter of 2015 (to reflect the March 7, 2016 Series A Preferred Stock dividend that was paid in December 2015), to include such $180 million Series A Preferred Stock dividend payment in the first quarter of 2016, and to exclude $51 million of Series A Preferred Stock dividends from the second quarter of 2016 (to reflect that it was redeemed on June 7, 2016). (g) U.S. Tax Reform included a tax benefit of $7.0 billion in 2017 related to enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act by the U.S. government on December 22, 2017. There were no such expenses in 2016 or 2015. See Overview at the beginning of this item for additional information. 45","Item 7A.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. We are exposed to market risks from adverse changes in commodity prices, foreign exchange rates, interest rates, and production costs. We monitor and manage these exposures as part of our overall risk management program. Our risk management program focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to reduce the potentially adverse effects that volatility in these markets may have on our operating results. We maintain risk management policies that principally use derivative financial instruments to reduce significant, unanticipated fluctuations in earnings and cash flows that may arise from variations in commodity prices, foreign currency exchange rates, and interest rates. See Note 1, Background and Basis of Presentation, and Note 11, Financial Instruments, to the consolidated financial statements for details of our market risk management policies and the financial instruments used to hedge those exposures. By policy, we do not engage in speculative or leveraged transactions, nor do we hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes. Effect of Hypothetical 10% Fluctuation in Market Prices: The potential gain or loss on the fair value of our outstanding commodity contracts, foreign exchange contracts, cross-currency, and swap contracts, assuming a hypothetical 10% fluctuation in commodity prices, currency rates, and swap rates, would be (in millions): December 30,  2017 (52 weeks)   December 31,  2016 (52 weeks) Commodity contracts $ 23     $ 39   Foreign currency contracts 173     179   Cross-currency swap contracts 287     306 It should be noted that any change in the fair value of the contracts, real or hypothetical, would be significantly offset by an inverse change in the value of the underlying hedged items. In relation to foreign currency contracts, this hypothetical calculation assumes that each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative to the U.S. dollar. Our utilization of financial instruments in managing market risk exposures described above is consistent with the prior year. Changes in our portfolio of financial instruments are a function of our results of operations, debt repayment and debt issuances, market effects on debt and foreign currency, and our acquisition and divestiture activities. 46","Item 8.  Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of The Kraft Heinz Company Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of The Kraft Heinz Company and its subsidiaries as of December 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 30, 2017, including the related notes and the financial statement schedule listed in the index appearing under Item 15(a) (collectively referred to as the ""consolidated financial statements"").  We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 30, 2017, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 30, 2017 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 30, 2017, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO. Change in Accounting Principle As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed the manner in which it presents cash receipts relating to beneficial interests obtained in securitized trade receivables in 2017. Basis for Opinions The Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A.  Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company's consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits.  We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (""PCAOB"") and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks.  Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements.  Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements.  Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.  Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. 47 Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.  A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP Chicago, Illinois February 16, 2018 We have served as the Company's or its predecessor's auditor since 1979. 48 The Kraft Heinz Company Consolidated Statements of Income (in millions, except per share data) December 30,  2017 (52 weeks)   December 31,  2016 (52 weeks)   January 3,  2016 (53 weeks) Net sales $ 26,232     $ 26,487     $ 18,338   Cost of products sold 16,529     16,901     12,577   Gross profit 9,703     9,586     5,761   Selling, general and administrative expenses 2,930     3,444     3,122   Operating income 6,773     6,142     2,639   Interest expense 1,234     1,134     1,321   Other expense/(income), net 9     (15 )   305   Income/(loss) before income taxes 5,530     5,023     1,013   Provision for/(benefit from) income taxes (5,460 )   1,381     366   Net income/(loss) 10,990     3,642     647   Net income/(loss) attributable to noncontrolling interest (9 )   10     13   Net income/(loss) attributable to Kraft Heinz 10,999     3,632     634   Preferred dividends  -

Background and Basis of Presentation Description of the Company We manufacture and market food and beverage products, including condiments and sauces, cheese and dairy, meals, meats, refreshment beverages, coffee, and other grocery products throughout the world. Organization On July 2, 2015 (the ""2015 Merger Date""), through a series of transactions, we consummated the merger of Kraft Foods Group, Inc. (""Kraft"") with and into a wholly-owned subsidiary of H.J. Heinz Holding Corporation (""Heinz"") (the ""2015 Merger""). At the closing of the 2015 Merger, Heinz was renamed The Kraft Heinz Company (""Kraft Heinz""). Before the consummation of the 2015 Merger, Heinz was controlled by Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (""Berkshire Hathaway"") and 3G Global Food Holdings, L.P. (""3G Capital"") (together, the ""Sponsors""), following their acquisition of H. J. Heinz Company (the ""2013 Merger"") on June 7, 2013. See Note 2, Merger and Acquisition, for additional information on the 2015 Merger. Immediately prior to the consummation of the 2015 Merger, each share of Heinz issued and outstanding common stock was reclassified and changed into 0.443332 of a share of Kraft Heinz common stock. All share and per share amounts in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the consolidated financial statements and related notes have been retroactively adjusted for all historical periods presented prior to the 2015 Merger Date to give effect to this conversion, including reclassifying an amount equal to the change in value of common stock to additional paid-in capital. In the 2015 Merger, all outstanding shares of Kraft common stock were converted into the right to receive, on a one-for-one basis, shares of Kraft Heinz common stock. Deferred shares and restricted shares of Kraft were converted to deferred shares and restricted shares of Kraft Heinz, as applicable. In addition, upon the completion of the 2015 Merger, the Kraft shareholders of record immediately prior to the closing of the 2015 Merger received a special cash dividend of $16.50 per share. The Sponsors initially owned 850 million shares of common stock in Heinz. Berkshire Hathaway also held a warrant to purchase 46 million additional shares of common stock, which it exercised in June 2015. Additionally, in connection with the 2013 Merger, we issued an $8.0 billion preferred stock investment in Heinz which entitled Berkshire Hathaway to a 9.00% annual dividend. Prior to, but in connection with, the 2015 Merger, the Sponsors made equity investments whereby they purchased an additional 500 million newly issued shares of Heinz common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $10.0 billion. Significant Accounting Policies Principles of Consolidation: The consolidated financial statements include The Kraft Heinz Company, as well as our wholly-owned and majority-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany transactions are eliminated. Use of Estimates: We prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (""U.S. GAAP""), which requires us to make accounting policy elections, estimates, and assumptions that affect a number of amounts in our consolidated financial statements. We base our estimates on historical experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable. If actual amounts differ from estimates, we include the revisions in our consolidated results of operations in the period the actual amounts become known. Historically, the aggregate differences, if any, between our estimates and actual amounts in any year have not had a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. Translation of Foreign Currencies: For all significant foreign operations, the functional currency is the local currency. Assets and liabilities of these operations are translated at the exchange rate in effect at each period end. Income statement accounts are translated at the average rate of exchange prevailing during the period. Translation adjustments arising from the use of differing exchange rates from period to period are included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income/(losses) on the balance sheet. Gains and losses from foreign currency transactions are included in net income/(loss) for the period. 55 Highly Inflationary Accounting: We apply highly inflationary accounting if the cumulative inflation rate in an economy for a three-year period meets or exceeds 100 percent. Under highly inflationary accounting, the financial statements of a subsidiary are remeasured into our reporting currency (U.S. dollars) based on the legally available exchange rate at which we expect to settle the underlying transactions. Exchange gains and losses from the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities are reflected in net income/(loss), rather than accumulated other comprehensive income/(losses) on the balance sheet, until such time as the economy is no longer considered highly inflationary. Certain non-monetary assets and liabilities are recorded at the applicable historical exchange rates. We apply highly inflationary accounting to the results of our Venezuelan subsidiary. Cash and Cash Equivalents: Cash equivalents include demand deposits with banks and all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less. Inventories: Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. We value inventories primarily using the average cost method. Property, Plant and Equipment: Property, plant and equipment are stated at historical cost and depreciated on the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Machinery and equipment are depreciated over periods ranging from three to 20 years and buildings and improvements over periods up to 40 years. Capitalized software costs are included in property, plant and equipment and amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the software, which do not exceed seven years. We review long-lived assets for impairment when conditions exist that indicate the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable. Such conditions include significant adverse changes in the business climate, current-period operating or cash flow losses, significant declines in forecasted operations, or a current expectation that an asset group will be disposed of before the end of its useful life. We perform undiscounted operating cash flow analyses to determine if an impairment exists. When testing for impairment of assets held for use, we group assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which cash flows are separately identifiable. If an impairment is determined to exist, the loss is calculated based on estimated fair value. Impairment losses on assets to be disposed of, if any, are based on the estimated proceeds to be received, less costs of disposal. Goodwill and Intangible Assets: We test goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment at least annually in the second quarter or when a triggering event occurs. The first step of the goodwill impairment test compares the reporting unit's estimated fair value with its carrying value. If the carrying value of a reporting unit's net assets exceeds its fair value, the second step would be applied to measure the difference between the carrying value and implied fair value of goodwill. If the carrying value of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, the goodwill would be considered impaired and would be reduced to its implied fair value. We test indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment by comparing the fair value of each intangible asset with its carrying value. If the carrying value exceeds fair value, the intangible asset would be considered impaired and would be reduced to fair value. Fair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions, estimates and market factors. Estimating the fair value of individual reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets requires us to make assumptions and estimates regarding our future plans, as well as industry and economic conditions. These assumptions and estimates include projected revenues and income growth rates, terminal growth rates, competitive and consumer trends, market-based discount rates, and other market factors. If current expectations of future growth rates are not met or market factors outside of our control, such as discount rates, change significantly, then one or more of our reporting units or intangible assets might become impaired in the future. Additionally, as goodwill and intangible assets associated with recently acquired businesses are recorded on the balance sheet at their estimated acquisition date fair values, those amounts are more susceptible to an impairment risk if business operating results or macroeconomic conditions deteriorate. We performed our annual impairment testing in the second quarter of 2017. See Note 7, Goodwill and Intangible Assets, for additional information. Definite-lived intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated periods benefited, and are reviewed when appropriate for possible impairment. Revenue Recognition: We recognize revenues when title and risk of loss pass to our customers. We record revenues net of consumer incentives and trade promotions and include all shipping and handling charges billed to customers. We also record provisions for estimated product returns and customer allowances as reductions to revenues within the same period that the revenue is recognized. We base these estimates principally on historical and current period experience factors. 56 Advertising, Consumer Incentives, and Trade Promotions: We promote our products with advertising, consumer incentives, and trade promotions. Consumer incentives and trade promotions include, but are not limited to, discounts, coupons, rebates, performance based in-store display activities, and volume-based incentives. Consumer incentive and trade promotion activities are recorded as a reduction to revenues based on amounts estimated as being due to customers and consumers at the end of a period. We base these estimates principally on historical utilization, redemption rates, or current period experience factors. We review and adjust these estimates each quarter based on actual experience and other information. Advertising expenses are recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses (""SG&A""). For interim reporting purposes, we charge advertising to operations as a percentage of estimated full year sales activity and marketing costs. We review and adjust these estimates each quarter based on actual experience and other information. We recorded advertising expenses of $629 million in 2017, $708 million in 2016, and $464 million in 2015. Research and Development Expense: We expense costs as incurred for product research and development within SG&A. Research and development expense was approximately $93 million in 2017, $120 million in 2016, and $105 million in 2015. Postemployment Benefit Plans: We maintain various retirement plans for the majority of our employees. These include pension benefits, postretirement health care benefits, and defined contribution benefits. The cost of these plans is charged to expense over the working life of the covered employees. We generally amortize net actuarial gains or losses in future periods within cost of products sold and SG&A. Financial Instruments: As we source our commodities on global markets and periodically enter into financing or other arrangements abroad, we use a variety of risk management strategies and financial instruments to manage commodity price, foreign currency exchange rate, and interest rate risks. Our risk management program focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to reduce the potentially adverse effects that the volatility of these markets may have on our operating results. One way we do this is through actively hedging our risks through the use of derivative instruments. As a matter of policy, we do not use highly leveraged derivative instruments, nor do we use financial instruments for speculative purposes. Derivatives are recorded on our consolidated balance sheets at fair value, which fluctuates based on changing market conditions. Certain derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges and qualify for hedge accounting treatment, while others are not designated as hedging instruments and are marked to market through earnings. The effective portion of gains and losses on cash flow hedges are deferred as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income/(losses) and are recognized in earnings at the time the hedged item affects earnings, in the same line item as the underlying hedged item. We also designate certain derivatives and non-derivatives as net investment hedges to hedge the net assets of certain foreign subsidiaries which are exposed to volatility in foreign currency exchange rates. The fair value of these derivatives and remeasurements of our non-derivatives designated as net investment hedges are calculated each period with changes reported in foreign currency translation adjustment within accumulated other comprehensive income/(losses). Such amounts will remain in accumulated other comprehensive income/(losses) until the complete or substantially complete liquidation of our investment in the underlying foreign operations. The income statement classification of gains and losses related to derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments is determined based on the underlying intent of the contracts. Cash flows related to the settlement of derivative instruments designated as net investment hedges of foreign operations are classified in the consolidated statements of cash flows within investing activities. All other cash flows related to derivative instruments are generally classified within operating activities. For additional information on derivative activity within our operating results, see Note 11, Financial Instruments. To qualify for hedge accounting, a specified level of hedging effectiveness between the hedging instrument and the item being hedged must be achieved at inception and maintained throughout the hedged period. Any hedging ineffectiveness is recognized in net earnings when the change in the value of the hedge does not offset the change in the value of the underlying hedged item. We formally document our risk management objectives, strategies for undertaking the various hedge transactions, the nature of and relationships between the hedging instruments and hedged items, and method for assessing hedge effectiveness. Additionally, for qualified hedges of forecasted transactions, we specifically identify the significant characteristics and expected terms of the forecasted transactions. If it becomes probable that a forecasted transaction will not occur, the hedge will no longer be effective and all of the derivative gains or losses would be recognized in earnings in the current period. Unrealized gains and losses on our commodity derivatives not designated as hedging instruments are recorded in general corporate expenses until realized. Once realized, the gains and losses are recorded within the applicable segment operating results. 57 When we use financial instruments, we are exposed to credit risk that a counterparty might fail to fulfill its performance obligations under the terms of our agreement. We minimize our credit risk by entering into transactions with counterparties with investment grade credit ratings, limiting the amount of exposure we have with each counterparty, and monitoring the financial condition of our counterparties. We also maintain a policy of requiring that all significant, non-exchange traded derivative contracts with a duration of greater than one year be governed by an International Swaps and Derivatives Association master agreement. We are also exposed to market risk as the value of our financial instruments might be adversely affected by a change in foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices, or interest rates. We manage market risk by incorporating monitoring parameters within our risk management strategy that limit the types of derivative instruments and derivative strategies we use and the degree of market risk that we hedge with derivative instruments. Foreign currency cash flow hedges: We use various financial instruments to mitigate our exposure to changes in exchange rates from third-party and intercompany actual and forecasted transactions. Our principal foreign currency exposures that are hedged include the British pound sterling, euro, and Canadian dollar. These instruments include forward foreign exchange contracts. Substantially all of these derivative instruments are highly effective and qualify for hedge accounting treatment. We exclude forward points from the assessment and measurement of hedge ineffectiveness and report such amounts in current period net income as interest expense. Net investment hedges: We have numerous investments in our foreign subsidiaries, the net assets of which are exposed to volatility in foreign currency exchange rates. We manage this risk by utilizing derivative and non-derivative instruments, including cross-currency swap contracts and certain foreign denominated debt designated as net investment hedges. Interest rate cash flow hedges: From time to time, we have used derivative instruments, including interest rate swaps, as part of our interest rate risk management strategy. We have primarily used interest rate swaps to hedge the variability of interest payment cash flows on a portion of our future debt obligations. Substantially all of these derivative instruments have been highly effective and have qualified for hedge accounting treatment. Commodity derivatives: We are exposed to price risk related to forecasted purchases of certain commodities that we primarily use as raw materials. We enter into commodity purchase contracts primarily for coffee beans, meat products, sugar, wheat products, corn products, vegetable oils, cocoa products, and dairy products. These commodity purchase contracts generally are not subject to the accounting requirements for derivative instruments and hedging activities under the normal purchases exception. We also use commodity futures and options to economically hedge the price of certain commodity costs, including coffee beans, meat products, sugar, wheat products, corn products, vegetable oils, cocoa products, dairy products, diesel fuel, and packaging products. We do not designate these commodity contracts as hedging instruments. We also sell commodity futures to unprice future purchase commitments, and we occasionally use related futures to economically cross hedge a commodity exposure. Income Taxes: We recognize income taxes based on amounts refundable or payable for the current year and record deferred tax assets or liabilities for any difference between U.S. GAAP accounting and tax reporting. We also recognize deferred tax assets for temporary differences, operating loss carryforwards, and tax credit carryforwards. Inherent in determining our annual tax rate are judgments regarding business plans, planning opportunities, and expectations about future outcomes. Realization of certain deferred tax assets, primarily net operating loss and other carryforwards, is dependent upon generating sufficient taxable income in the appropriate jurisdiction prior to the expiration of the carryforward periods. We apply a more-likely-than-not threshold to the recognition and derecognition of uncertain tax positions. Accordingly, we recognize the amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being ultimately realized upon settlement. Future changes in judgment related to the expected ultimate resolution of uncertain tax positions will affect income in the quarter of such change. We record valuation allowances to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. When assessing the need for valuation allowances, we consider future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. Should a change in circumstances lead to a change in judgment about the realizability of deferred tax assets in future years, we would adjust related valuation allowances in the period that the change in circumstances occurs, along with a corresponding increase or charge to income. The resolution of tax reserves and changes in valuation allowances could be material to our results of operations for any period, but is not expected to be material to our financial position. 58 Common Stock and Preferred Stock Dividends: Dividends are recorded as a reduction to retained earnings. When we have an accumulated deficit, dividends are recorded as a reduction of additional paid-in capital. New Accounting Pronouncements Accounting Standards Adopted in the Current Year: In March 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the ""FASB"") issued accounting standards update (""ASU"") 2016-09 related to equity-based award accounting and presentation. Under this guidance, excess tax benefits upon the exercise of share- based payment awards are recognized in our tax provision rather than within equity. Cash flows related to excess tax benefits are classified as operating activities rather than financing activities. Additionally, cash flows related to employee tax withholdings on restricted share vesting are classified as financing activities. This ASU became effective in the first quarter of 2017. We adopted the guidance related to excess tax benefits on a prospective basis. As a result, we recognized a tax benefit of $22 million in our consolidated statement of income for 2017 related to our excess tax benefits upon the exercise of share-based payment awards. We retrospectively adopted the guidance related to cash flow classification of employee tax withholdings on restricted share vesting. This guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated statement of cash flows for 2016. The impact on our consolidated statement of cash flows for 2015 was a $31 million decrease to cash flows provided by financing activities and a corresponding increase to cash flows provided by operating activities. Our equity award compensation cost continues to reflect estimated forfeitures. In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15 related to the classification of certain cash payments and cash receipts on the statement of cash flows. This ASU provided guidance on eight specific cash flow classification matters, which must be adopted in the same period using a retrospective transition method. We early adopted this ASU in the first quarter of 2017. We now classify consideration received for beneficial interest obtained for transferring trade receivables in securitization transactions as investing activities instead of operating activities. Accordingly, we reclassified cash receipts from the payments on sold receivables (which are cash receipts on the underlying trade receivables that have already been securitized) to cash provided by investing activities (from cash provided by operating activities). The impact on our consolidated statement of cash flows was $2.6 billion for 2016, and $1.3 billion for 2015. In connection with the adoption of ASU 2016-15, we also corrected other immaterial cash flow misstatements within operating activities, which had misstated the amount of beneficial interest obtained in the non-cash exchange from the securitization of trade receivables. Additionally, we now classify cash payments for debt prepayment and debt extinguishment costs as cash outflows from financing activities rather than cash outflows from operating activities. The impact on our consolidated statement of cash flows for 2015 was a $105 million decrease to cash provided by financing activities and a corresponding increase to cash provided by operating activities. There was no impact on our consolidated statement of cash flows for 2016. In November 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-18 requiring the statement of cash flows to explain the change in restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents, in addition to cash and cash equivalents. We early adopted this ASU in the first quarter of 2017. Accordingly, we restated our cash and cash equivalents balances in the consolidated statements of cash flows to include restricted cash of $51 million at December 31, 2016, $75 million at January 3, 2016, and $12 million at December 28, 2014. Additionally, cash provided by investing activities in 2016 decreased by $24 million and cash used for investing activities in 2015 decreased by $64 million. As required by the ASU, we have provided a reconciliation from cash and cash equivalents as presented on our condensed consolidated balance sheets to cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash as reported on our condensed consolidated statements of cash flows. See Note 4, Restricted Cash, for this reconciliation, as well as a discussion of the nature of our restricted cash balances. Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted: In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, which superseded previously existing revenue recognition guidance. Under this ASU, companies will apply a principles-based five step model to recognize revenue upon the transfer of promised goods or services to customers and in an amount that reflects the consideration for which the company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. This ASU will be effective beginning in the first quarter of our fiscal year 2018. The ASU may be applied using a full retrospective method or a modified retrospective transition method, with a cumulative-effect adjustment as of the date of adoption. The ASU also provides for certain practical expedients, including the option to expense as incurred the incremental costs of obtaining a contract, if the contract period is for one year or less. We plan to use this practical expedient upon adoption of this ASU; the impact is expected to be insignificant as this expedient aligns with our current practice. Additionally, we plan to make the following policy elections upon adoption of this ASU in the first quarter of 2018: (i) we will account for shipping and handling costs as contract fulfillment costs, and (ii) we will exclude taxes imposed on and collected from customers in revenue producing transactions (e.g, sales, use, and value added taxes) from the transaction price. We expect that the impact of adopting this guidance will be immaterial to our financial statements and related disclosures. There will be no impact to net income upon adoption of this ASU. We will adopt this ASU using the full retrospective method on the first day of our fiscal year 2018. 59 In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, which superseded previously existing leasing guidance. The ASU is intended to establish the principles that lessees and lessors shall apply to report useful information to users of financial statements about the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from a lease. The new guidance requires lessees to reflect most leases on their balance sheets as assets and obligations. This ASU will be effective beginning in the first quarter of our fiscal year 2019. Early adoption is permitted. The new guidance must be adopted using a modified retrospective transition, and provides for certain practical expedients. While we are still evaluating the impact this ASU will have on our financial statements and related disclosures, we have completed our scoping reviews and have made progress in our assessment phase. We have identified our significant leases by geography and by asset type as well as our leasing processes which will be impacted by the new standard. Furthermore, we have developed a data extraction strategy, made significant progress on lease data collection efforts, and identified an accounting system to support the future state leasing process. We have also made progress in developing the policy elections we will make upon adoption. We expect that our financial statement disclosures will be expanded to present additional details of our leasing arrangements. At this time, we are unable to reasonably estimate the expected increase in assets and liabilities on our condensed consolidated balance sheets upon adoption. We will adopt this ASU on the first day of our fiscal year 2019. In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-16 related to the income tax accounting impacts of intra-entity transfers of assets other than inventory, such as intellectual property and property, plant and equipment. Under the new accounting guidance, current and deferred income taxes should be recognized upon transfer of the assets. Previously, recognition of current and deferred income taxes was prohibited until the asset was sold to an external party. This ASU will be effective beginning in the first quarter of our fiscal year 2018. The new guidance must be adopted on a modified retrospective basis through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the adoption period. We will adopt this ASU on the first day of our fiscal year 2018. While we are still evaluating the impact of this ASU, we currently anticipate a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings of approximately $100 million upon adoption. In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04 related to goodwill impairment testing. This ASU eliminates Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test. Under the new guidance, if a reporting unit's carrying amount exceeds its fair value, the entity will record an impairment charge based on that difference. The impairment charge will be limited to the amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. Previously, if the fair value of a reporting unit was lower than its carrying amount (Step 1), an entity was required to calculate any impairment charge by comparing the implied fair value of goodwill with its carrying amount (Step 2). Additionally, under the new standard, entities that have reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts will no longer be required to perform the qualitative assessment to determine whether to perform Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test. As a result, reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts will generally be expected to pass the simplified impairment test; however, additional disclosure will be required of those entities. This ASU will be effective beginning in the first quarter of our fiscal year 2020. Early adoption is permitted for annual and interim goodwill impairment testing dates after January 1, 2017. The new guidance must be adopted on a prospective basis. While we are still evaluating the timing of adoption, we currently do not expect this ASU to have a material impact on our financial statements and related disclosures. In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-01 clarifying the definition of a business used in determining whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions (or disposals) of assets or businesses. The ASU provides a screen for entities to determine if an integrated set of assets and activities (""set"") is not a business. If substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired (or disposed of) is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or a group of similar identifiable assets, the set is not a business. If this screen is not met, the entity then determines if the set meets the minimum requirement of a business. For a set to be a business, it must include an input and a substantive process which together significantly contribute to the ability to create outputs. The current guidance does not specify the minimum processes that are required for a set be a business. The ASU also updates the definition of outputs to be the result of inputs and processes applied to those inputs that provide goods or services to customers, investment income (such as dividends or interest), or other revenues. This ASU will be effective beginning in the first quarter of our fiscal year 2018 and must be adopted on a prospective basis. We will adopt this ASU on the first day of our fiscal year 2018. We currently expect the adoption of this ASU to result in more transactions accounted for as asset acquisitions or disposals. We currently cannot reasonably estimate the impact that adoption of this ASU will have on our financial statements and related disclosures as it will depend on the facts and circumstances of individual transactions. 60 In March 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-07 related to the presentation of net periodic benefit cost (pension and postretirement cost). This ASU will be effective beginning in the first quarter of our fiscal year 2018. Under the new guidance, the service cost component of net periodic benefit cost must be presented in the same statement of income line item as other employee compensation costs arising from services rendered by employees during the period. Other components of net periodic benefit cost must be disaggregated from the service cost component in the statements of income and must be presented outside the operating income subtotal. Additionally, only the service cost component will be eligible for capitalization in assets. The new guidance must be applied retrospectively for the statement of income presentation of service cost components and other net periodic benefit cost components and prospectively for the capitalization of service cost components. There is a practical expedient that allows us to use historical amounts disclosed in our Postemployment Benefits footnote as an estimation basis for retrospectively applying the statement of income presentation requirements. We plan to use this practical expedient when we adopt this ASU on the first day of our fiscal year 2018. The retrospective impact of adopting ASU 2017-07 in 2018 is expected to be (in millions): December 30,  2017 (52 weeks)   December 31,  2016 (52 weeks)   January 3,  2016 (53 weeks) Increase/(decrease) to cost of products sold $ 558     $ 373     $ 202   Increase/(decrease) to selling, general and administrative expenses 78     93     (30 ) Increase/(decrease) to operating income(a) (636 )   (466 )   (172 ) (a)  Includes amortization of prior service costs/(credits), curtailments, special/contractual termination benefits, and certain settlements. These components of net pension and postretirement cost/(benefit) are excluded from Segment Adjusted EBITDA and totaled approximately $(480) million in 2017, $(340) million in 2016, and $(120) million in 2015. In August 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-12 related to accounting for hedging activities. This guidance will impact the accounting for our financial (i.e., foreign exchange and interest rate) and non-financial (i.e., commodity) hedging activities. Key components of this ASU that could impact us are as follows:  Grants the ability to hedge the risk associated with the change in a contractually specified component of the purchase or sale of a non-financial item instead of the total contractual price, which could allow more commodity contracts to qualify for hedge accounting;  Requires us to defer the entire change in value of the derivative, including the effective and ineffective portion, into other comprehensive income until the hedged item impacts net income. When released, the deferred hedge gains and losses, including the ineffective portion, will be recognized in the same statement of income line affected by the hedged item;  Allows us to recognize changes in the fair value of excluded components in other comprehensive income (which will be amortized into net income over the life of the derivative) or in net income in the related period;  Changes hedge effectiveness testing, including timing and allowable methods of testing; and,  Requires additional tabular disclosures in the footnotes to the financial statements. The method for adopting the revised standard is modified retrospective. This ASU will be effective beginning in the first quarter of our fiscal year 2019. Early adoption is permitted, including in an interim period. We are currently evaluating the timing of adoption and the impact this ASU will have on our financial statements and related disclosures. Note 2.  Merger and Acquisition Transaction Overview: As discussed in Note 1, Background and Basis of Presentation, Heinz merged with Kraft on July 2, 2015. The Kraft businesses manufacture and market food and beverage products, including cheese, meats, refreshment beverages, coffee, packaged dinners, refrigerated meals, snack nuts, dressings, and other grocery products, primarily in the United States and Canada. Following the 2015 Merger Date, the operating results of the Kraft businesses have been included in our consolidated financial statements. For the period from the 2015 Merger Date through January 3, 2016, Kraft's net sales were $8.5 billion and net income was $478 million. The 2015 Merger was accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations and Heinz was considered to be the acquiring company. Under the acquisition method of accounting, total consideration exchanged was (in millions): Aggregate fair value of Kraft common stock $ 42,502   $16.50 per share special cash dividend 9,782   Fair value of replacement equity awards 353   Total consideration exchanged $ 52,637 61 Valuation Assumptions and Purchase Price Allocation: We utilized estimated fair values at the 2015 Merger Date to allocate the total consideration exchanged to the net tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed. This allocation was final as of July 3, 2016. The final purchase price allocation to assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction was (in millions): Cash $ 314   Other current assets 3,423   Property, plant and equipment 4,179   Identifiable intangible assets 47,771   Other non-current assets 214   Trade and other payables (3,026 ) Long-term debt (9,286 ) Net postemployment benefits and other non-current liabilities (4,739 ) Deferred income tax liabilities (16,675 ) Net assets acquired 22,175   Goodwill on acquisition 30,462   Total consideration 52,637   Fair value of shares exchanged and equity awards 42,855   Total cash consideration paid to Kraft shareholders 9,782   Cash and cash equivalents of Kraft at the 2015 Merger Date 314   Acquisition of business, net of cash on hand $ 9,468 The 2015 Merger resulted in $30.5 billion of non tax deductible goodwill relating principally to synergies expected to be achieved from the combined operations and planned growth in new markets. Goodwill has been allocated to our segments as shown in Note 7, Goodwill and Intangible Assets. The purchase price allocation to identifiable intangible assets acquired was: Fair Value   Weighted Average Life   (in millions of dollars)   (in years) Indefinite-lived trademarks $ 43,104       Definite-lived trademarks 1,690     24 Customer-related assets 2,977     29 Total $ 47,771 We valued trademarks using either the excess earnings method or relief from royalty method, which are both variations of the income approach. We used the excess earnings method for our most significant trademarks due to their impact on the cash flows of the business and used the relief from royalty method for the remaining trademarks and licenses. For customer relationships, we used the distributor method, a variation of the excess earnings method that uses distributor-based inputs for margins and contributory asset charges. Some of the more significant assumptions inherent in developing the valuations included the estimated annual net cash flows for each indefinite-lived or definite-lived intangible asset (including net sales, cost of products sold, selling and marketing costs, and working capital/contributory asset charges), the discount rate that appropriately reflects the risk inherent in each future cash flow stream, the assessment of each asset's life cycle, and competitive trends, as well as other factors. We determined the assumptions used in the financial forecasts using historical data, supplemented by current and anticipated market conditions, estimated product category growth rates, management plans, and market comparables. We used carrying values as of July 2, 2015 to value trade receivables and payables, as well as certain other current and non-current assets and liabilities, as we determined that they represented the fair value of those items at the 2015 Merger Date. We valued finished goods and work-in-process inventory using a net realizable value approach, which resulted in a step-up of $347 million that was recognized in cost of products sold in the period from the 2015 Merger Date to September 27, 2015 as the related inventory was sold. Raw materials and packaging inventory was valued using the replacement cost approach. 62 We valued property, plant and equipment using a combination of the income approach, the market approach and the cost approach, which is based on current replacement and/or reproduction cost of the asset as new, less depreciation attributable to physical, functional, and economic factors. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities as of the 2015 Merger Date represented the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed and their tax bases. Pro Forma Results: Our unaudited pro forma results, prepared in accordance with ASC 805, as if Kraft had been acquired as of December 30, 2013 were (in millions, except per share data): January 3,  2016 (53 weeks) Net sales $ 27,447   Net income 1,761   Basic earnings per share 0.72   Diluted earnings per share 0.70 The unaudited pro forma results include certain purchase accounting adjustments. We have made pro forma adjustments to exclude deal costs of $166 million ($102 million net of tax) and $347 million ($213 million net of tax) of non-cash costs related to the fair value step-up of inventory (""Inventory Step-up Costs"") from 2015, because such costs are non-recurring and are directly attributable to the 2015 Merger. The unaudited pro forma results do not include any anticipated cost savings or other effects of future restructuring efforts. Unaudited pro forma amounts are not necessarily indicative of results had the 2015 Merger occurred on December 30, 2013 or of future results. Note 3.  Integration and Restructuring Expenses As part of our restructuring activities, we incur expenses that qualify as exit and disposal costs under U.S. GAAP. These include severance and employee benefit costs and other exit costs. Severance and employee benefit costs primarily relate to cash severance, non-cash severance, including accelerated equity award compensation expense, and pension and other termination benefits. Other exit costs primarily relate to lease and contract terminations. We also incur expenses that are an integral component of, and directly attributable to, our restructuring activities, which do not qualify as exit and disposal costs under U.S. GAAP. These include asset-related costs and other implementation costs. Asset-related costs primarily relate to accelerated depreciation and asset impairment charges. Other implementation costs primarily relate to start-up costs of new facilities, professional fees, asset relocation costs, and costs to exit facilities. Employee severance and other termination benefit packages are primarily determined based on established benefit arrangements, local statutory requirements, or historical benefit practices. We recognize the contractual component of these benefits when payment is probable and estimable; additional elements of severance and termination benefits associated with non-recurring benefits are recognized ratably over each employee's required future service period. Charges for accelerated depreciation are recognized on long-lived assets that will be taken out of service before the end of their normal service, in which case depreciation estimates are revised to reflect the use of the asset over its shortened useful life. Asset impairments establish a new fair value basis for assets held for disposal or sale and those assets are written down to expected net realizable value if carrying value exceeds fair value. All other costs are recognized as incurred. 63 Integration Program: Following the 2015 Merger, we announced a multi-year program (the ""Integration Program"") designed to reduce costs, streamline and simplify our operating structure as well as optimize our production and supply chain network across our businesses in the United States and Canada segments. We expect to incur pre-tax costs of approximately $2.1 billion related to the Integration Program. These pre-tax costs are comprised of the following categories:  Organization costs (approximately $400 million) associated with streamlining and simplifying our operating structure, resulting in workforce reduction (primarily severance and employee benefit costs).  Footprint costs (approximately $1.3 billion) associated with optimizing our production and supply chain network, resulting in workforce reduction and facility closures and consolidations (primarily asset-related costs and severance and employee benefit costs).  Other costs (approximately $400 million) incurred as a direct result of integration activities, including other exit costs (primarily lease and contract terminations) and other implementation costs (primarily professional services and other third-party fees). Approximately 60% of the Integration Program costs will be reflected in cost of products sold and approximately 60% will be cash expenditures. In 2017, we substantially completed our Integration Program. Overall, as part of the Integration Program, we have closed net six factories and consolidated our distribution network. We expect to eliminate approximately 5,200 positions, 4,900 of whom have left the Company as of December 30, 2017. The Integration Program liability at December 30, 2017 related primarily to the elimination of general salaried and factory positions across the United States and Canada. As of December 30, 2017, we have incurred cumulative costs of $2,055 million, including $339 million in 2017, $887 million in 2016, and $829 million in 2015. The $2,055 million of cumulative costs included $539 million of severance and employee benefit costs, $858 million of non-cash asset-related costs, $550 million of other implementation costs, and $108 million of other exit costs. The related amounts incurred in 2017 were a $142 million credit related to severance and employee benefit costs, $208 million of non-cash asset-related costs, $260 million of other implementation costs, and $13 million of other exit costs. We expect to incur further Integration Program costs in 2018. Our liability balance for Integration Program costs that qualify as exit and disposal costs under U.S. GAAP (i.e., severance and employee benefit costs and other exit costs), was (in millions): Severance and Employee Benefit Costs   Other Exit Costs(a)   Total Balance at December 31, 2016 $ 99     $ 10     $ 109   Charges/(credits) (142 )   13     (129 ) Cash payments (70 )   (7 )   (77 ) Non-cash utilization 137     6     143   Balance at December 30, 2017 $ 24     $ 22     $ 46 (a) Other exit costs primarily consist of lease and contract terminations. We expect that a substantial portion of the liability for severance and employee benefit costs as of December 30, 2017 to be paid in 2018. The liability for other exit costs primarily relates to lease obligations. The cash impact of these obligations will continue for the duration of the lease terms, which expire between 2019 and 2026. Restructuring Activities: In addition to our Integration Program in North America, we have a small number of other restructuring programs globally, which are focused primarily on workforce reduction and factory closure and consolidation. Related to these programs, approximately 600 employees left the Company in 2017. These programs resulted in expenses of $118 million in 2017, including $50 million of severance and employee benefit costs, $10 million of non-cash asset-related costs, $48 million of other implementation costs, and $10 million of other exit costs. Other restructuring program expenses totaled $125 million in 2016 and $194 million in 2015. 64 Our liability balance for restructuring project costs that qualify as exit and disposal costs under U.S. GAAP (i.e., severance and employee benefit costs and other exit costs), was (in millions): Severance and Employee Benefit Costs   Other Exit Costs(a)   Total Balance at December 31, 2016 $ 12     $ 25     $ 37   Charges/(credits) 50     10     60   Cash payments (38 )   (9 )   (47 ) Non-cash utilization (8 )   (1 )   (9 ) Balance at December 30, 2017 $ 16     $ 25     $ 41 (a) Other exit costs primarily consist of lease and contract terminations. We expect that a substantial portion of the liability for severance and employee benefit costs as of December 30, 2017 to be paid in 2018. The liability for other exit costs primarily relates to lease obligations. The cash impact of these obligations will continue for the duration of the lease terms, which expire between 2018 and 2026. Total Integration and Restructuring: Total expenses related to the Integration Program and restructuring activities recorded in cost of products sold and SG&A were (in millions): December 30,  2017 (52 weeks)   December 31,  2016 (52 weeks)   January 3,  2016 (53 weeks) Severance and employee benefit costs - COGS $ (130 )   $ 53     $ 119   Severance and employee benefit costs - SG&A 38     104     519   Asset-related costs - COGS 190     496     186   Asset-related costs - SG&A 28     41     7   Other costs - COGS 264     162     99   Other costs - SG&A 67     156     93     $ 457     $ 1,012     $ 1,023 We do not include Integration Program and restructuring expenses within Segment Adjusted EBITDA (as defined in Note 19, Segment Reporting).

Goodwill and Intangible Assets Goodwill: Changes in the carrying amount of goodwill, by segment, were (in millions): United States   Canada   Europe   Rest of World   Total Balance at December 31, 2016 $ 33,696     $ 4,913     $ 2,778     $ 2,738     $ 44,125   Translation adjustments and other 4     333     281     81     699   Balance at December 30, 2017 $ 33,700     $ 5,246     $ 3,059     $ 2,819     $ 44,824 We test goodwill for impairment at least annually in the second quarter or when a triggering event occurs. We performed our 2017 annual impairment test as of April 2, 2017. As a result of our 2017 annual impairment test, there was no impairment of goodwill. Each of our goodwill reporting units had excess fair value over its carrying value of at least 10% as of April 2, 2017. 66 Our goodwill balance consists of 18 reporting units and had an aggregate carrying value of $44.8 billion as of December 30, 2017. As a majority of our goodwill was recently recorded in connection with the 2013 Merger and the 2015 Merger, representing fair values as of those merger dates, there was not a significant excess of fair values over carrying values as of April 2, 2017. We have a risk of future impairment to the extent that individual reporting unit performance does not meet our projections. Additionally, if our current assumptions and estimates, including projected revenues and income growth rates, terminal growth rates, competitive and consumer trends, market-based discount rates, and other market factors, are not met, or if valuation factors outside of our control change unfavorably, the estimated fair value of our goodwill could be adversely affected, leading to a potential impairment in the future. No events occurred during the period ended December 30, 2017 that indicated it was more likely than not that our goodwill was impaired. There were no accumulated impairment losses to goodwill as of December 30, 2017. Indefinite-lived intangible assets: Changes in the carrying amount of indefinite-lived intangible assets, which primarily consisted of trademarks, were (in millions): Balance at December 31, 2016 $ 53,307   Translation adjustments 397   Impairment losses on indefinite-lived intangible assets (49 ) Balance at December 30, 2017 $ 53,655 We test indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment at least annually in the second quarter or when a triggering event occurs. We performed our 2017 annual impairment test as of April 2, 2017. As a result of our 2017 annual impairment test, we recognized a non-cash impairment loss of $49 million in SG&A in 2017. This loss was due to continued declines in nutritional beverages in India. The loss was recorded in our Europe segment as the related trademark is owned by our Italian subsidiary. Each of our other brands had excess fair value over its carrying value of at least 10% as of April 2, 2017. Our indefinite-lived intangible assets primarily consist of a large number of individual brands and had an aggregate carrying value of $53.7 billion as of December 30, 2017. As a majority of our indefinite-lived intangible assets were recently recorded in connection with the 2013 Merger and the 2015 Merger, representing fair values as of those merger dates, there was not a significant excess of fair values over carrying values as of April 2, 2017. We have a risk of future impairment to the extent individual brand performance does not meet our projections. Additionally, if our current assumptions and estimates, including projected revenues and income growth rates, terminal growth rates, competitive and consumer trends, market-based discount rates, and other market factors, are not met, or if valuation factors outside of our control change unfavorably, the estimated fair values of our indefinite-lived intangible assets could be adversely affected, leading to potential impairments in the future. No events occurred during the period ended December 30, 2017 that indicated it was more likely than not that our indefinite-lived intangible assets were impaired. There was no impairment of indefinite-lived intangible assets as a result of our 2016 testing. In 2015, we recognized non-cash impairment losses of $58 million in SG&A, primarily related to declines within frozen soup in the United States, frozen meals and snacks primarily in the United Kingdom, and pasta sauce in the United States and Canada. Definite-lived intangible assets: Definite-lived intangible assets were (in millions):  December 30, 2017   December 31, 2016   Gross   Accumulated Amortization   Net   Gross   Accumulated Amortization   Net Trademarks $ 2,386     $ (288 )   $ 2,098     $ 2,337     $ (172 )   $ 2,165   Customer-related assets 4,231     (544 )   3,687     4,184     (369 )   3,815   Other 14     (5 )   9     13     (3 )   10     $ 6,631     $ (837 )   $ 5,794     $ 6,534     $ (544 )   $ 5,990 Amortization expense for definite-lived intangible assets was $279 million in 2017, $268 million in 2016, and $178 million in 2015. Aside from amortization expense, the changes in definite-lived intangible assets from December 31, 2016 to December 30, 2017 primarily reflect the impact of foreign currency. We estimate that amortization expense related to definite-lived intangible assets will be approximately $272 million for the next twelve months and approximately $270 million for each of the four years thereafter. 67 Note 8.  Income Taxes On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (""U.S. Tax Reform"") was enacted by the U.S. federal government. The legislation significantly changed U.S. tax law by, among other things, lowering the federal corporate tax rate from 35.0% to 21.0%, effective January 1, 2018, implementing a territorial tax system, and imposing a one-time toll charge on deemed repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries as of December 30, 2017. In addition, there are many new provisions, including changes to bonus depreciation, the deduction for executive compensation and interest expense, a tax on global intangible low-taxed income provisions (""GILTI""), the base erosion anti-abuse tax (""BEAT""), and a deduction for foreign-derived intangible income (""FDII""). The two material items that impacted us in 2017 were the corporate tax rate reduction and the one-time toll charge. While the corporate tax rate reduction is effective January 1, 2018, we accounted for this anticipated rate change in 2017, the period of enactment. The SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (""SAB 118""), which provides us with up to one year to finalize accounting for the impacts of U.S. Tax Reform. When the initial accounting for U.S Tax Reform impacts is incomplete, we may include provisional amounts when reasonable estimates can be made or continue to apply the prior tax law if a reasonable estimate cannot be made. We have estimated the provisional tax impacts related to the toll charge, certain components of the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, including depreciation and executive compensation, and the change in our indefinite reinvestment assertion. As a result, we recognized a net tax benefit of approximately $7.0 billion, including a reasonable estimate of our deferred income tax benefit of approximately $7.5 billion related to the corporate rate change, which was partially offset by a reasonable estimate of $312 million for the toll charge and approximately $125 million for other tax expenses, including a change in our indefinite reinvestment assertion. We have elected to account for the tax on GILTI as a period cost and thus have not adjusted any of the deferred tax assets and liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries for U.S. Tax Reform. The ultimate impact may differ from these provisional amounts due to gathering additional information to more precisely compute the amount of tax, changes in interpretations and assumptions, additional regulatory guidance that may be issued, and actions we may take. We expect to finalize accounting for the impacts of U.S. Tax Reform when the 2017 U.S. corporate income tax return is filed in 2018. In connection with U.S. Tax Reform, we have also reassessed our international investment assertions and no longer consider the historic earnings of our foreign subsidiaries as of December 30, 2017 to be indefinitely reinvested. We have made a reasonable estimate of local country withholding taxes that would be owed when our historic earnings are distributed. As a result, we have recorded deferred income taxes of $96 million on approximately $1.2 billion of historic earnings. Income/(loss) before income taxes and the provision for/(benefit from) income taxes, consisted of the following (in millions): December 30,  2017 (52 weeks)   December 31,  2016 (52 weeks)   January 3,  2016 (53 weeks) Income/(loss) before income taxes:           United States $ 3,876     $ 3,358     $ (13 ) International 1,654     1,665     1,026   Total $ 5,530     $ 5,023     $ 1,013               Provision for/(benefit from) income taxes:           Current:           U.S. federal $ 757     $ 1,095     $ 427   U.S. state and local (46 )   76     22   International 296     239     234     1,007     1,410     683   Deferred:           U.S. federal (6,570 )   31     (173 ) U.S. state and local 101     (60 )   (70 ) International 2      -      (74 )   (6,467 )   (29 )   (317 ) Total provision for/(benefit from) income taxes $ (5,460 )   $ 1,381     $ 366 68 Tax benefits related to the exercise of stock options and other equity instruments recorded directly to additional paid-in capital totaled $30 million in 2016 and $10 million in 2015. In the first quarter of 2017, we prospectively adopted ASU 2016-09. We now record tax benefits related to the exercise of stock options and other equity instruments within our tax provision, rather than within equity. Accordingly, we recognized a tax benefit of $22 million within our 2017 statement of income related to tax benefits upon the exercise of stock options and other equity instruments. The effective tax rate on income/(loss) before income taxes differed from the U.S. federal statutory tax rate for the following reasons: December 30,  2017 (52 weeks)   December 31,  2016 (52 weeks)   January 3,  2016 (53 weeks) U.S. federal statutory tax rate 35.0  %   35.0  %   35.0  % Increase/(decrease) resulting from:           Tax on income of foreign subsidiaries (4.7 )%   (3.6 )%   (11.8 )% Domestic manufacturing deduction (1.5 )%   (1.9 )%   (2.9 )% U.S. state and local income taxes, net of federal tax benefit 1.1  %   0.8  %   (0.6 )% Earnings repatriation 0.4  %   0.4  %   21.9  % Tax exempt income (0.7 )%   (3.3 )%   (10.9 )% Deferred tax effect of statutory tax rate changes 0.3  %   (2.0 )%   (10.4 )% Audit settlements and changes in uncertain tax positions (0.1 )%   1.8  %   6.2  % Venezuela nondeductible devaluation loss  -   %   0.2  %   9.9  % Impact of U.S. Tax Reform (127.3 )%    -   %    -   % Other (1.2 )%   0.1  %   (0.2 )% Effective tax rate (98.7 )%   27.5  %   36.2  % The provision for income taxes consists of provisions for federal, state and foreign income taxes. We operate in an international environment; accordingly, the consolidated effective tax rate is a composite rate reflecting the earnings in various locations and the applicable tax rates. Additionally, the calculation of the percentage point impact of U.S. Tax Reform, domestic manufacturing deductions, tax exempt income, uncertain tax positions and other items on the effective tax rate shown in the table above are affected by income/(loss) before income taxes. Fluctuations in the amount of income generated across locations around the world could impact comparability of reconciling items between periods. The tax provision for the 2017 tax year benefited from U.S. Tax Reform enacted on December 22, 2017. The related income tax benefit of 127.3% in 2017 primarily reflects adjustments to our deferred tax positions for the lower federal income tax rate, partially offset by our provision for the one-time toll charge. Due to the 2015 Merger, the tax provision for 2016 reflected a much greater percentage of U.S. income, which unfavorably impacted the effective tax rate compared to 2015. The tax provision for the 2015 tax year benefited from a favorable jurisdictional income mix and from impairment losses recorded in the U.S. The 2016 and 2015 tax years included a benefit related to the tax effect of statutory tax rate changes. Small movements in tax rates due to a change in tax law or a change in tax rates that causes us to revalue our deferred tax balances produces volatility in our effective tax rate. In addition:  The 2016 tax year included a benefit related to the impact on deferred taxes of a 10 basis point reduction in the state tax rate and a 100 basis point statutory rate reduction in the United Kingdom.  The 2015 tax year included a benefit related to the impact on deferred taxes of a 200 basis point statutory rate reduction in the United Kingdom. 69 The tax effects of temporary differences and carryforwards that gave rise to deferred income tax assets and liabilities consisted of the following (in millions): December 30, 2017   December 31, 2016 Deferred income tax liabilities:       Intangible assets, net $ 13,637     $ 20,946   Property, plant and equipment, net 641     1,035   Other 293     532   Deferred income tax liabilities 14,571     22,513   Deferred income tax assets:       Benefit plans (212 )   (1,025 ) Other (428 )   (782 ) Deferred income tax assets (640 )   (1,807 ) Valuation allowance 80     89   Net deferred income tax liabilities $ 14,011     $ 20,795 The $9 million decrease in our valuation allowance in 2017 reflects the impact of releasing valuation allowances for foreign net operating losses and foreign tax credits that we anticipate being able to utilize. At December 30, 2017, foreign operating loss carryforwards totaled $336 million. Of that amount, $41 million expire between 2018 and 2037; the other $295 million do not expire. We have recorded $84 million of deferred tax assets related to these foreign operating loss carryforwards. Additionally, we have foreign operating loss carryforwards of $1.0 billion for which the realization of a tax benefit is considered remote and, as a result, we have recorded a full valuation allowance for the tax benefits. However, due to the remote likelihood of utilizing these losses, neither the deferred tax asset nor the offsetting valuation allowance has been presented in the table above. Deferred tax assets of $39 million have been recorded for U.S. state and local operating loss carryforwards. These losses expire between 2018 and 2037. Deferred tax assets of $7 million have been recorded for U.S. foreign tax credit carryforwards. These credit carryforwards expire between 2020 and 2025. At December 30, 2017, our unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions were $408 million. If we had recognized all of these benefits, the impact on our effective tax rate would have been $316 million. It is reasonably possible that our unrecognized tax benefits will decrease by as much as $105 million in the next 12 months primarily due to the progression of federal, state, and foreign audits in process. Our unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions are included in income taxes payable (current liabilities) and other liabilities (long-term) on our consolidated balance sheets. The changes in our unrecognized tax benefits were (in millions): December 30,  2017 (52 weeks)   December 31,  2016 (52 weeks)   January 3,  2016 (53 weeks) Balance at the beginning of the period $ 389     $ 353     $ 71   Increases for tax positions of prior years 2     59     25   Decreases for tax positions of prior years (35 )   (18 )   (9 ) Increases based on tax positions related to the current year 135     62     33   Increases due to acquisitions of businesses  -       -      242   Decreases due to settlements with taxing authorities (59 )   (62 )    -    Decreases due to lapse of statute of limitations (24 )   (5 )   (9 ) Balance at the end of the period $ 408     $ 389     $ 353 Our unrecognized tax benefits increased during 2017 as a result of evaluating tax positions taken or expected to be taken on our federal, state, and foreign income tax returns. This increase was partially offset primarily as a result of audit settlements with federal, state and foreign taxing authorities and statute of limitations expirations. In the third quarter of 2016, we reached an agreement with the IRS resolving all Kraft open matters related to the audits of taxable years 2012 through 2014. This settlement reduced our reserves for uncertain tax positions and resulted in a non-cash tax benefit of $42 million. 70 The gross unrecognized tax balance increased substantially for the year ended January 3, 2016 as a result of the 2015 Merger purchase accounting. We include interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in our tax provision. Our provision for/(benefit from) income taxes included a $24 million benefit in 2017, $8 million expense in 2016, and $18 million expense in 2015 related to interest and penalties. Accrued interest and penalties were $57 million as of December 30, 2017 and $81 million as of December 31, 2016. In the normal course of business, we are subject to examination by taxing authorities throughout the world, including such major jurisdictions as Australia, Canada, Italy, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and the United States. We have substantially concluded all national income tax matters through 2015 for the Netherlands, through 2014 for the United States, through 2012 for the United Kingdom, through 2011 for Australia, and through 2010 for Canada and Italy. We have substantially concluded all state income tax matters through 2007. We have a tax sharing agreement with Mondelez International, Inc. (""Mondelez International""), which generally provides that (i) we are liable for U.S. state income taxes and Canadian federal and provincial income taxes for Kraft periods prior to October 1, 2012 and (ii) Mondelez International is responsible for U.S. federal income taxes and substantially all non-U.S. income taxes, excluding Canadian income taxes, for Kraft periods prior to October 1, 2012. Kraft's U.S. operations were included in Mondelez International's U.S. federal consolidated income tax returns for tax periods through October 1, 2012. In December 2016, Mondelez International reached a final resolution on a U.S. federal income tax audit of the 2010-2012 tax years. As noted above, we are indemnified for U.S. federal income taxes related to these periods. Note 9.  Employees' Stock Incentive Plans Stock Incentive Plans We issued equity-based awards from the following plans in 2017, 2016, and 2015: 2016 Omnibus Incentive Plan: In April 2016, our Board of Directors approved the 2016 Omnibus Incentive Plan (""2016 Omnibus Plan""), which authorized grants of options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock units (""RSUs""), deferred stock, performance awards, investment rights, other stock-based awards, and cash-based awards. This plan authorizes the issuance of up to 18 million shares of our common stock. We grant non-qualified stock options under the 2016 Omnibus Plan to select employees with a five-year cliff vesting. Such options have a maximum exercise term of 10 years. 2013 Omnibus Incentive Plan: In October 2013, our Board of Directors adopted the 2013 Omnibus Incentive Plan (""2013 Omnibus Plan""), which authorized the issuance of shares of capital stock. Each Heinz stock option that was outstanding under the 2013 Omnibus Plan immediately prior to the completion of the 2015 Merger was converted into 0.443332 of a Kraft Heinz stock option. Following this conversion, the 2013 Omnibus Plan authorized the issuance of up to 17,555,947 shares of our common stock. All Heinz stock option amounts have been retrospectively adjusted for the Successor periods presented to give effect to this conversion. We grant non-qualified stock options under the 2013 Omnibus Plan to select employees with a five-year cliff vesting. Such options have a maximum exercise term of 10 years. If a participant is involuntarily terminated without cause, 20% of their options will vest, on an accelerated basis, for each full year of service after the grant date. Kraft 2012 Performance Incentive Plan: Prior to the 2015 Merger, Kraft issued equity-based awards, including stock options and RSUs, under its 2012 Performance Incentive Plan. As a result of the 2015 Merger, each outstanding Kraft stock option was converted into an option to purchase a number of shares of our common stock based upon an option adjustment ratio, and each outstanding Kraft RSU was converted into one Kraft Heinz RSU. These Kraft Heinz stock awards will continue to vest and become exercisable in accordance with the terms and conditions that were applicable immediately prior to the completion of the 2015 Merger. These options generally become exercisable in three annual installments beginning on the first anniversary of the original grant date, and have a maximum exercise term of 10 years. RSUs generally cliff vest on the third anniversary of the original grant date. In accordance with the terms of the 2012 Performance Incentive Plan, vesting generally accelerates for holders of Kraft awards who are terminated without cause within two years of the 2015 Merger Date. In addition, prior to the 2015 Merger, Kraft issued performance based long-term incentive awards (""Performance Shares""), which vested based on varying performance, market, and service conditions. In connection with the 2015 Merger, all outstanding Performance Shares were converted into cash awards, payable in two installments: (i) a 2015 pro-rata payment based upon the portion of the Performance Share cycle completed prior to the 2015 Merger and (ii) the remaining value of the award to be paid on the earlier of the first anniversary of the closing of the 2015 Merger and a participant's termination without cause. 71 Stock Options We use the Black-Scholes model to estimate the fair value of stock option grants. We used the Hull-White II Lattice (""Lattice"") model to estimate the fair value of Kraft converted stock options. We believe the Lattice model provided an appropriate estimate of fair value of Kraft converted options as it took into account each option's distinct in-the-money level and remaining terms. The grant date fair value of options is amortized to expense over the vesting period. Our weighted average Black-Scholes fair value assumptions were: December 30,  2017 (52 weeks)   December 31,  2016 (52 weeks)   January 3,  2016 (53 weeks) Risk-free interest rate 2.25 %   1.63 %   1.70 % Expected term 7.5 years     7.5 years     6.3 years   Expected volatility 19.6 %   22.0 %   22.9 % Expected dividend yield 2.8 %   3.1 %   1.5 % Weighted average grant date fair value per share $ 14.24     $ 12.48     $ 9.60 The risk-free interest rate represented the constant maturity U.S. Treasury rate in effect at the grant date, with a remaining term equal to the expected life of the options. The expected life is the period over which our employees are expected to hold their options. Due to the lack of historical data for 2017 and 2016, we calculated expected life using the Safe Harbor method, which uses the weighted average vesting period and the contractual term of the options. In 2015, the weighted average expected life of options was based on consideration of historical exercise patterns adjusted for changes in the contractual term and exercise periods of the awards. In 2017 and 2016, volatility was estimated using a blended approach of implied volatility and peer volatility. Peer volatility was calculated as the average of the term-matched, leverage-adjusted historical volatilities of Colgate-Palmolive Co., The Coca-Cola Company, Mondelez International, Altria Group, Inc., PepsiCo, Inc., and Unilever plc. In 2015, volatility was estimated based on a review of the equity volatilities of publicly-traded peer companies for a period commensurate with the expected life of the options. In 2017 and 2016, the expected dividend yield was estimated using the quarterly dividend divided by the three-month average stock price, annualized and continuously compounded. In 2015, dividend yield was estimated over the expected life of the options based on our stated dividend policy. Our Lattice model fair value assumptions for the Kraft converted options were: January 3,  2016 (53 weeks) Risk-free interest rate 1.72 % Expected volatility 20.10 % Expected dividend yield 3.00 % Weighted average fair value on conversion date $ 35.65 The risk-free interest rate represented the constant maturity U.S. Treasury rate in effect at the conversion date, with a remaining term equal to the expected life of the options. The expected volatility was calculated as the average leverage-adjusted historical volatility of several peer companies, matched to the remaining term of each option. Dividend yield was estimated based on our stated dividend policy and conversion date stock price.

Cash received from options exercised was $66 million in 2017, $140 million in 2016, and $29 million in 2015. The tax benefit realized from stock options exercised was $44 million in 2017, $68 million in 2016, and $12 million in 2015.

Our RSUs include performance share units (""PSUs"") that are subject to achievement or satisfaction of performance conditions specified by the Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors. We used the stock price on the grant date to estimate the fair value of our RSUs and PSUs. Additionally, the fair value of our PSUs is discounted based on the dividend yield as they are not dividend eligible during the vesting period. The grant date fair value of RSUs and PSUs is amortized to expense over the vesting period. The weighted average grant date fair value per share of our RSUs and PSUs granted during the year was $85.03 in 2017, $77.53 in 2016, and $26.24 in 2015. In 2017, our expected dividend yield was 2.7%. Dividend yield was estimated using the quarterly dividend divided by the three-month average stock price, annualized and continuously compounded. There were no PSUs granted in 2016 or 2015; therefore there was no expected dividend yield for these periods. Our RSU activity and related information was: Number of Units   Weighted Average Grant Date Fair Value  (per share) Outstanding at December 31, 2016 806,744     $ 71.95   Granted 1,686,254     85.03   Forfeited (251,604 )   83.00   Vested (141,749 )   73.01   Outstanding at December 30, 2017 2,099,645     81.05 The aggregate fair value of RSUs that vested during the period was $12 million in 2017, $40 million in 2016, and $76 million in 2015. Total Equity Awards The compensation cost related to equity awards was primarily recognized in general corporate expenses within SG&A. Equity award compensation cost and the related tax benefit was (in millions): December 30,  2017 (52 weeks)   December 31,  2016 (52 weeks)   January 3,  2016 (53 weeks) Pre-tax compensation cost $ 46     $ 46     $ 133   Related tax benefit (14 )   (15 )   (48 ) After-tax compensation cost $ 32     $ 31     $ 85 Unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested equity awards was $151 million at December 30, 2017 and is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of four years. 73 Note 10.  Postemployment Benefits We maintain various retirement plans for the majority of our employees. Current defined benefit pension plans are provided primarily for certain domestic union and foreign employees. Local statutory requirements govern many of these plans. The pension benefits of our unionized workers are in accordance with the applicable collective bargaining agreement covering their employment. Defined contribution plans are provided for certain domestic unionized, non-union hourly, and salaried employees as well as certain employees in foreign locations. We provide health care and other postretirement benefits to certain of our eligible retired employees and their eligible dependents. Certain of our U.S. and Canadian employees may become eligible for such benefits. We may modify plan provisions or terminate plans at our discretion. The postretirement benefits of our unionized workers are in accordance with the applicable collective bargaining agreement covering their employment. Prior to the 2015 Merger, Kraft provided a range of benefits to its employees and retirees, including pension benefits and postretirement health care benefits. As part of the 2015 Merger, we assumed the assets and liabilities associated with these plans. We remeasure our postemployment benefit plans at least annually.

We used the following weighted average assumptions to determine our projected benefit obligations under the pension plans: U.S. Plans   Non-U.S. Plans   December 30, 2017   December 31, 2016   December 30, 2017   December 31, 2016 Discount rate 3.7 %   4.2 %   2.4 %   2.9 % Rate of compensation increase 4.1 %   4.1 %   3.9 %   4.0 % 75 Components of Net Pension Cost/(Benefit): Net pension cost/(benefit) consisted of the following (in millions): U.S. Plans   Non-U.S. Plans   December 30,  2017 (52 weeks)   December 31,  2016 (52 weeks)   January 3,  2016 (53 weeks)   December 30,  2017 (52 weeks)   December 31,  2016 (52 weeks)   January 3,  2016 (53 weeks) Service cost $ 11     $ 13     $ 45     $ 19     $ 25     $ 26   Interest cost 178     203     164     66     87     103   Expected return on plan assets (262 )   (290 )   (179 )   (180 )   (182 )   (194 ) Amortization of unrecognized losses/(gains)  -       -      3     1      -       -    Settlements 2     23     102      -      2     17   Curtailments  -       -      (96 )    -       -      (47 ) Special/contractual termination benefits 19      -      4     9     3     6   Other 2      -       -      (15 )    -       -    Net pension cost/(benefit) $ (50 )   $ (51 )   $ 43     $ (100 )   $ (65 )   $ (89 ) We capitalized a portion of net pension cost/(benefit) into inventory based on our production activities. The amounts capitalized into inventory as of December 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016 are included in the table above. In 2016, we approved the wind up of our Canadian salaried and Canadian hourly defined benefit pension plans effective December 31, 2016. This action resulted in an increase to our projected benefit obligations of approximately $85 million at December 31, 2016. This action had no impact on the consolidated statements of income or consolidated statements of cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2016. In 2015, we recorded net settlement losses for the U.S. and non-U.S. plans primarily related to certain plan terminations. We also recorded net curtailment gains for the U.S. and non-U.S. plans primarily related to certain plan freezes and work force reductions under our integration and restructuring activities. We used the following weighted average assumptions to determine our net pension costs: U.S. Plans   Non-U.S. Plans   December 30,  2017 (52 weeks)   December 31,  2016 (52 weeks)   January 3,  2016 (53 weeks)   December 30,  2017 (52 weeks)   December 31,  2016 (52 weeks)   January 3,  2016 (53 weeks) Discount rate - Service Cost 4.2 %   4.5 %   4.4 %   3.2 %   4.2 %   3.7 % Discount rate - Interest Cost 3.6 %   3.5 %   4.4 %   2.1 %   3.3 %   3.7 % Expected rate of return on plan assets 5.7 %   5.7 %   5.6 %   4.8 %   5.6 %   6.4 % Rate of compensation increase 4.1 %   4.1 %   4.0 %   4.0 %   3.4 %   3.3 % Discount rates for our U.S. and non-U.S. plans were developed from a model portfolio of high quality, fixed-income debt instruments with durations that match the expected future cash flows of the plans. We determine our expected rate of return on plan assets from the plan assets' historical long-term investment performance, target asset allocation, and estimates of future long-term returns by asset class. Plan Assets: The underlying basis of the investment strategy of our defined benefit plans is to ensure that pension funds are available to meet the plans' benefit obligations when they are due. Our investment objectives include: investing plan assets in a high-quality, diversified manner in order to maintain the security of the funds; achieving an optimal return on plan assets within specified risk tolerances; and investing according to local regulations and requirements specific to each country in which a defined benefit plan operates. The investment strategy expects equity investments to yield a higher return over the long term than fixed-income securities, while fixed-income securities are expected to provide certain matching characteristics to the plans' benefit payment cash flow requirements. Our investment policy specifies the type of investment vehicles appropriate for the applicable plan, asset allocation guidelines, criteria for the selection of investment managers, procedures to monitor overall investment performance as well as investment manager performance. It also provides guidelines enabling the applicable plan fiduciaries to fulfill their responsibilities. 76 Our weighted average asset allocations were: U.S. Plans   Non-U.S. Plans   December 30, 2017   December 31, 2016   December 30, 2017   December 31, 2016 Fixed-income securities 62 %   67 %   39 %   49 % Equity securities 27 %   30 %   27 %   31 % Real estate  -  %    -  %   6 %   7 % Cash and cash equivalents 11 %   3 %   4 %   8 % Certain insurance contracts  -  %    -  %   24 %   5 % Total 100 %   100 %   100 %   100 % Our pension asset strategy for U.S. plans is designed to align our pension assets with our projected benefit obligation to reduce volatility by targeting an investment of approximately 70% of our U.S. plan assets in fixed-income securities and approximately 30% in return-seeking assets, primarily equity securities. For pension plans outside the U.S., our investment strategy is subject to local regulations and the asset/liability profiles of the plans in each individual country. In aggregate, the long-term asset allocation targets of our non-U.S. plans are broadly characterized as a mix of approximately 65% fixed-income securities and annuity contracts, and approximately 35% in return-seeking assets, primarily equity securities and real estate. The fair value of pension plan assets at December 30, 2017 was determined using the following fair value measurements (in millions): Asset Category Total Fair Value   Quoted Prices in Active Markets for Identical Assets  (Level 1)   Significant Other Observable Inputs  (Level 2)   Significant Unobservable Inputs  (Level 3) Government bonds $ 467     $ 467     $  -      $  -    Corporate bonds and other fixed-income securities 2,606      -      2,606      -    Total fixed-income securities 3,073     467     2,606      -    Equity securities 1,044     1,044      -       -    Real estate 262      -       -      262   Cash and cash equivalents 208     205     3      -    Certain insurance contracts 983      -       -      983   Fair value excluding investments measured at net asset value 5,570     1,716     2,609     1,245   Investments measured at net asset value(a) 3,371               Total plan assets at fair value $ 8,941 (a) Amount includes cash collateral of $278 million associated with our securities lending program, which is reflected as an asset, and a corresponding securities lending payable of $278 million, which is reflected as a liability.

Government Bonds. These securities consist of direct investments in publicly traded U.S. and non-U.S. fixed interest obligations (principally debentures). Such investments are valued using quoted prices in active markets. These securities are principally included in Level 1. Corporate Bonds and Other Fixed-Income Securities. These securities consist of publicly traded U.S. and non-U.S. fixed interest obligations (principally corporate bonds). Such investments are valued through consultation and evaluation with brokers in the institutional market using quoted prices and other observable market data. As such, these securities are included in Level 2. Equity Securities. These securities consist of direct investments in the stock of publicly traded companies. Such investments are valued based on the closing price reported in an active market on which the individual securities are traded. As such, the direct investments are classified as Level 1. Real Estate. These holdings consist of real estate investments. Direct investments of real estate are valued by investment managers based on the most recent financial information available, which typically represents significant unobservable data. As such, these investments are generally classified as Level 3. Cash and Cash Equivalents. This consists of direct cash holdings and institutional short-term investment vehicles. Direct cash holdings are valued based on cost, which approximates fair value and are classified as Level 1. Certain institutional short-term investment vehicles are valued daily and are classified as Level 1. Other cash equivalents that are not traded on an active exchange, such as bank deposits, are classified as Level 2. Certain Insurance Contracts. This category consists of group annuity contracts that have been purchased to cover a portion of the plan members. The fair value of non-participating annuity buy-in contracts fluctuates based on fluctuations in the obligation associated with the covered plan members. The fair value of certain participating annuity contracts are reported at contract value. These values have been classified as Level 3. Investments Measured at Net Asset Value. This category consists of pooled funds, short-term investments and partnership/corporate feeder interests. Pooled funds. The fair values of participation units held in collective trusts are based on their net asset values, as reported by the managers of the collective trusts and as supported by the unit prices of actual purchase and sale transactions occurring as of or close to the financial statement date. The fair value of these investments measured at net asset value is excluded from the fair value hierarchy. Investments in the collective trusts can be redeemed on each business day based upon the applicable net asset value per unit. Investments in the international large/mid cap equity collective trust can be redeemed on the last business date of each month and at least one business day during the month. 78 The mutual fund investments are not traded on an exchange and a majority of these funds are held in a separate account managed by a fixed income manager. The fair values of the mutual fund investments that are not traded on an exchange are based on their net asset values, as reported by the managers and as supported by the unit prices of actual purchase and sale transactions occurring as of or close to the financial statement date. The fair value of these investments measured at net asset value is excluded from the fair value hierarchy. The objective of the account is to provide superior return with reasonable risk, where performance is expected to exceed Barclays Long U.S. Credit Index. Investments in this account can be redeemed with a written notice to the investment manager. Short-term investments: Short-term investments largely consisted of a money market fund, the fair value of which is based on the net asset value reported by the manager of the fund and supported by the unit prices of actual purchase and sale transactions. The fair value of these investments measured at net asset value is excluded from the fair value hierarchy. The money market fund is designed to provide safety of principal, daily liquidity, and a competitive yield by investing in high quality money market instruments. The investment objective of the money market fund is to provide the highest possible level of current income while still maintaining liquidity and preserving capital. Partnership/corporate feeder interests: Fair value estimates of the equity partnership are based on their net asset values, as reported by the manager of the partnership. The fair value of these investments measured at net asset value is excluded from the fair value hierarchy. Investments in the equity partnership may be redeemed once per month upon 10 days' prior written notice to the General Partner, subject to the discretion of the General Partner. The investment objective of the equity partnership is to seek capital appreciation by investing primarily in equity securities. The fair values of the corporate feeder are based upon the net asset values of the equity master fund in which it invests. The fair value of these investments measured at net asset value is excluded from the fair value hierarchy. Investments in the corporate feeder can be redeemed quarterly with at least 90 days' notice. The investment objective of the corporate feeder is to generate long-term returns by investing in large, liquid equity securities with attractive fundamentals.

We estimate that 2018 pension contributions will be approximately $50 million to our non-U.S. plans. We do not plan to contribute to our U.S. pension plans in 2018. Our actual contributions and plans may change due to many factors, including the timing of regulatory approval for the windup of certain non-U.S. pension plans, changes in tax, employee benefit, or other laws and regulations, tax deductibility, significant differences between expected and actual pension asset performance or interest rates, or other factors. 79 Future Benefit Payments: The estimated future benefit payments from our pension plans at December 30, 2017 were (in millions): U.S. Plans   Non-U.S. Plans 2018 $ 367     $ 1,343   2019 331     72   2020 334     73   2021 337     76   2022 357     85   2023-2027 1,531     452 Postretirement Plans Obligations and Funded Status: The accumulated benefit obligation, fair value of plan assets, and funded status of our postretirement benefit plans were (in millions): December 30, 2017   December 31, 2016 Benefit obligation at beginning of year $ 1,714     $ 1,945   Service cost 10     11   Interest cost 49     51   Benefits paid (142 )   (150 ) Actuarial losses/(gains) (70 )   5   Plan amendments (24 )   (158 ) Currency 13     6   Other 3     4   Benefit obligation at end of year 1,553     1,714   Fair value of plan assets at beginning of year  -       -    Employer contributions 1,329      -    Benefits paid (142 )    -    Other 1      -    Fair value of plan assets at end of year 1,188      -    Net postretirement benefit liability/(asset) recognized at end of year $ 365     $ 1,714 We recognized the net postretirement benefit asset/(liability) on our consolidated balance sheets as follows (in millions): December 30, 2017   December 31, 2016 Accrued postemployment costs (current liabilities) (10 )   (153 ) Accrued postemployment costs (long-term liabilities) (355 )   (1,561 ) Net postretirement benefit asset/(liability) recognized $ (365 )   $ (1,714 ) For certain of our postretirement benefit plans that were underfunded based on accumulated postretirement benefit obligations in excess of plan assets, the accumulated benefit obligations and the fair value of plan assets were (in millions): December 30, 2017   December 31, 2016 Accumulated benefit obligation $ 1,553     $ 1,714   Fair value of plan assets 1,188      - 80 We used the following weighted average assumptions to determine our postretirement benefit obligations: December 30, 2017   December 31, 2016 Discount rate 3.5 %   3.8 % Health care cost trend rate assumed for next year 6.7 %   6.3 % Ultimate trend rate 4.9 %   4.9 % Discount rates for our plans were developed from a model portfolio of high-quality, fixed-income debt instruments with durations that match the expected future cash flows of the plans. Our expected health care cost trend rate is based on historical costs and our expectation for health care cost trend rates going forward. The year that the health care cost trend rate reaches the ultimate trend rate varies by plan and ranges between 2018 and 2030 as of December 30, 2017. Assumed health care costs trend rates have a significant impact on the amounts reported for the postretirement benefit plans. A one-percentage-point change in assumed health care cost trend rates would have the following effects, increase/(decrease) in cost and obligation, as of December 30, 2017 (in millions): One-Percentage-Point   Increase   (Decrease) Effect on annual service and interest cost $ 4     $ (3 ) Effect on postretirement benefit obligation 55     (47 ) Plan Assets: In December 2017, we made a cash contribution of approximately $1.2 billion to pre-fund a portion of our U.S. postretirement plan benefits following enactment of U.S. Tax Reform on December 22, 2017. The underlying basis of the investment strategy of our U.S. postretirement plans is to ensure that funds are available to meet the plans' benefit obligations when they are due by investing plan assets in a high-quality, diversified manner in order to maintain the security of the funds. The investment strategy expects equity investments to yield a higher return over the long term than fixed-income securities, while fixed-income securities are expected to provide certain matching characteristics to the plans' benefit payment cash flow requirements. Our postretirement benefit plan asset allocation at December 30, 2017 was 100% short-term investments. Our postretirement benefit plan investment strategy is subject to local regulations and the asset/liability profiles of the plans in each individual country. Our investment strategy is designed to align our postretirement benefit plan assets with our postretirement benefit obligation to reduce volatility. In aggregate, our long-term asset allocation targets are broadly characterized as a mix of approximately 70% in fixed-income securities and approximately 30% in return-seeking assets, primarily equity securities. The fair value of our postretirement benefit plan assets, which were all classified as short-term investments, was $1.2 billion at December 30, 2017. There were no postretirement benefit plan assets and no associated fair value at December 31, 2016. Short-term investments consist of a money market mutual fund, the fair value of which is based on the closing price reported in an active market on which the mutual fund is traded. As such, these investments are classified as Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy. The money market mutual fund is designed to provide safety of principal, daily liquidity, and a competitive yield by investing in high quality money market instruments. The investment objective of the money market mutual fund is to provide the highest possible level of current income while still maintaining liquidity and preserving capital. 81 Components of Net Postretirement Cost/(Benefit): Net postretirement cost/(benefit) consisted of the following (in millions): December 30,  2017 (52 weeks)   December 31,  2016 (52 weeks)   January 3,  2016 (53 weeks) Service cost $ 10     $ 11     $ 13   Interest cost 49     51     56   Amortization of prior service costs/(credits) (328 )   (362 )   (112 ) Amortization of unrecognized losses/(gains)  -      (1 )    -    Curtailments (177 )    -      1   Net postretirement cost/(benefit) $ (446 )   $ (301 )   $ (42 ) We capitalized a portion of net postretirement cost/(benefit) into inventory based on our production activities. The amounts capitalized into inventory as of December 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016 are included in the table above. In 2017, we remeasured certain of our postretirement plans and recognized a curtailment gain of $177 million. The curtailment was triggered by the number of cumulative headcount reductions after the closure of certain U.S. factories during the year. The resulting gain is attributed to accelerating a portion of the previously deferred actuarial gains and prior service credits. The headcount reductions and factory closures were part of our ongoing Integration Program. See Note 3, Integration and Restructuring Expenses, for additional information. The amortization of prior service credits was primarily driven by the 2015 plan amendments. Amortization of prior service credits in 2017 and 2016 included 12 months of amortization related to the 2015 plan amendments, and 2015 included four months of such amortization. We used the following weighted average assumptions to determine our net postretirement benefit plans cost: December 30,  2017 (52 weeks)   December 31,  2016 (52 weeks)   January 3,  2016 (53 weeks) Discount rate - Service Cost 4.0 %   4.3 %   4.2 % Discount rate - Interest Cost 3.0 %   3.0 %   4.2 % Health care cost trend rate 6.3 %   6.5 %   6.7 % Employer Contributions: In 2017, we contributed $1.3 billion to our postretirement benefit plans. This amount includes certain benefit payments of $142 million which are paid as incurred rather than pre-funded. We estimate that 2018 postretirement benefit plan contributions will be approximately $15 million. Our actual contributions and plans may change due to many factors, including changes in tax, employee benefit, or other laws and regulations, tax deductibility, significant differences between expected and actual postretirement plan asset performance or interest rates, or other factors. Future Benefit Payments: Our estimated future benefit payments for our postretirement plans at December 30, 2017 were (in millions):2018 $ 147   2019 140   2020 133   2021 126   2022 120   2023-2027 504 Other Costs We sponsor and contribute to employee savings plans that cover eligible salaried, non-union, and union employees. Our contributions and costs are determined by the matching of employee contributions, as defined by the plans. Amounts charged to expense for defined contribution plans totaled $78 million in 2017, $74 million in 2016, and $52 million in 2015. 82 Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income/(Losses): Our accumulated other comprehensive income/(losses) pension and postretirement benefit plans balances, before tax, consisted of the following (in millions):  Pension Benefits   Postretirement Benefits   Total   December 30, 2017   December 31, 2016   December 30, 2017   December 31, 2016   December 30, 2017   December 31, 2016 Net actuarial gain/(loss) $ 13     $ (35 )   $ 111     $ 64     $ 124     $ 29   Prior service credit/(cost) 1      -      748     1,205     749     1,205     $ 14     $ (35 )   $ 859     $ 1,269     $ 873     $ 1,234 The net postemployment benefits recognized in other comprehensive income/(loss), consisted of the following (in millions):  December 30,  2017 (52 weeks)   December 31,  2016 (52 weeks)   January 3,  2016 (53 weeks) Net postemployment benefit gains/(losses) arising during the period:           Net actuarial gains/(losses) arising during the period - Pension Benefits $ 45     $ (73 )   $ 3   Net actuarial gains/(losses) arising during the period - Postretirement Benefits 71     (5 )   62   Prior service credits/(costs) arising during the period - Pension Benefits 1      -      (7 ) Prior service credits/(costs) arising during the period - Postretirement Benefits 24     158     1,507     141     80     1,565   Tax benefit/(expense) (55 )   (23 )   (619 )   $ 86     $ 57     $ 946               Reclassification of net postemployment benefit losses/(gains) to net income/(loss):           Amortization of unrecognized losses/(gains) - Pension Benefits $ 1     $  -      $ 3   Amortization of unrecognized losses/(gains) - Postretirement Benefits  -      (1 )    -    Amortization of prior service costs/(credits) - Postretirement Benefits (328 )   (362 )   (112 ) Net settlement and curtailment losses/(gains) - Pension Benefits 2     25     (24 ) Net settlement and curtailment losses/(gains) - Postretirement Benefits (177 )    -      1     (502 )   (338 )   (132 ) Tax benefit/(expense) 193     131     47     $ (309 )   $ (207 )   $ (85 ) As of December 30, 2017, we expect to amortize $311 million of postretirement benefit plans prior service credits from accumulated other comprehensive income/(losses) into net postretirement benefit plans costs/(benefits) during 2018. We do not expect to amortize any other significant postemployment benefit losses/(gains) into net pension or net postretirement benefit plan costs/(benefits) during 2018. Note 11.

We elect to record the gross assets and liabilities of our derivative financial instruments on the consolidated balance sheets. If the derivative financial instruments had been netted on the consolidated balance sheets, the asset and liability positions each would have been reduced by $23 million at December 30, 2017 and $67 million at December 31, 2016. No material amounts of collateral were received or posted on our derivative assets and liabilities at December 30, 2017. Level 1 financial assets and liabilities consist of commodity future and options contracts and are valued using quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities. Level 2 financial assets and liabilities consist of commodity swaps, foreign exchange forwards and swaps, and cross-currency swaps. Commodity swaps are valued using an income approach based on the observable market commodity index prices less the contract rate multiplied by the notional amount. Foreign exchange forwards and swaps are valued using an income approach based on observable market forward rates less the contract rate multiplied by the notional amount. Cross-currency swaps are valued based on observable market spot and swap rates. Our calculation of the fair value of financial instruments takes into consideration the risk of nonperformance, including counterparty credit risk. There have been no transfers between Levels 1, 2, and 3 in any period presented. 84 The fair values of our derivative assets are recorded within other current assets and other assets. The fair values of our liability derivatives are recorded within other current liabilities and other liabilities. Net Investment Hedging: At December 30, 2017, the principal amounts of foreign denominated debt designated as net investment hedges totaled 2,550 million and £400 million. At December 30, 2017, our cross-currency swaps designated as net investment hedges consisted of: Instrument   Notional (local) (in billions)   Notional  (USD) (in billions)   Maturity Cross-currency swap   £ 0.8     $ 1.4     October 2019 Cross-currency swap   C$ 1.8     $ 1.6     December 2019 We also periodically enter into shorter-dated foreign exchange contracts that are designated as net investment hedges. At December 30, 2017, we had Chinese renminbi foreign exchange contracts with an aggregate USD notional amount of $213 million. The component of the gains and losses on our net investment in these designated foreign operations, driven by changes in foreign exchange rates, are economically offset by movements in the fair values of our cross-currency swap contracts and remeasurement of our foreign denominated debt. Interest Rate Hedging: In 2015, we de-designated all of our outstanding interest rate swaps (total notional amount of $7.9 billion) from hedging relationships in connection with the repayment of the Term B-1 and Term B-2 loans. We determined that the related forecasted future cash flows were probable of not occurring, and as a result, we reclassified $227 million of deferred losses initially reported in accumulated other comprehensive income/(losses) to net income/(loss) as interest expense. Hedge Coverage: At December 30, 2017, we had entered into contracts designated as hedging instruments, which hedge transactions for the following durations:  foreign exchange contracts for periods not exceeding the next 18 months; and  cross-currency contracts for periods not exceeding the next 24 months. At December 30, 2017, we had entered into contracts not designated as hedging instruments, which hedge economic risks for the following durations:  commodity contracts for periods not exceeding the next 12 months; and  foreign exchange contracts for periods not exceeding the next six months.  cross-currency contracts for periods not exceeding the next 22 months. Hedge Ineffectiveness: We record pre-tax gains or losses reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income/(losses) due to ineffectiveness for foreign exchange contracts related to forecasted transactions in other expense/(income), net. Deferred Hedging Gains and Losses: Based on our valuation at December 30, 2017 and assuming market rates remain constant through contract maturities, we expect transfers to net income/(loss) of unrealized losses for foreign currency cash flow hedges during the next 12 months to be $13 million. Additionally, we expect transfers to net income/(loss) of unrealized losses for interest rate cash flow hedges during the next 12 months to be insignificant. Concentration of Credit Risk: Counterparties to our foreign exchange derivatives consist of major international financial institutions. We continually monitor our positions and the credit ratings of the counterparties involved and, by policy, limit the amount of our credit exposure to any one party. While we may be exposed to potential losses due to the credit risk of non-performance by these counterparties, losses are not anticipated. We closely monitor the credit risk associated with our counterparties and customers and to date have not experienced material losses. 85 Economic Hedging: We enter into certain derivative contracts not designated as hedging instruments in accordance with our risk management strategy which have an economic impact of largely mitigating commodity price risk and foreign currency exposures. Gains and losses are recorded in net income/(loss) as a component of cost of products sold for our commodity contracts and other expense/(income), net for our cross currency and foreign exchange contracts.

In this note we have excluded activity and balances related to noncontrolling interest (which was primarily comprised of foreign currency translation adjustments) due to its insignificance. 89 Note 13.  Venezuela - Foreign Currency and Inflation We have a subsidiary in Venezuela that manufactures and sells a variety of products, primarily in the condiments and sauces and infant and nutrition categories. We apply highly inflationary accounting to the results of our Venezuelan subsidiary and include these results in our consolidated financial statements. Our results of operations in Venezuela reflect a controlled subsidiary. We continue to have sufficient currency liquidity and pricing flexibility to control our operations. However, the continuing economic uncertainty, strict labor laws, and evolving government controls over imports, prices, currency exchange, and payments present a challenging operating environment. Increased restrictions imposed by the Venezuelan government or further deterioration of the economic environment could impact our ability to control our Venezuelan operations and could lead us to deconsolidate our Venezuelan subsidiary in the future. We currently do not expect to make any new investments or contributions into Venezuela. At December 30, 2017, there were two exchange rates legally available to us for converting Venezuelan bolivars to U.S. dollars, including:  the official exchange rate of BsF10 per U.S. dollar available through the Sistema de Divisa Protegida (""DIPRO"") for purchases and sales of essential items, including food products; and  an alternative exchange rate available through the Sistema de Divisa Complementaria (""DICOM"") for all transactions not covered by DIPRO. The published DICOM rate was BsF3,345 per U.S. dollar at December 30, 2017. We have had no settlements at the DIPRO rate in 2017. At December 30, 2017, we had outstanding requests of $26 million for payment of invoices for the purchase of ingredients and packaging materials for the years 2012 through 2015, all of which were requested for payment at BsF6.30 per U.S. dollar (the official exchange rate until March 10, 2016). We have had access to U.S. dollars at DICOM rates in 2017. However, since September 2017 the Venezuelan government has not held any auctions through which we obtain U.S. dollars at DICOM rates. Accordingly, we did not have access to U.S. dollars at DICOM rates in the fourth quarter of 2017. In addition to DIPRO and DICOM, there is an unofficial market for obtaining U.S. dollars with Venezuelan bolivars. The exact exchange rate is widely debated but is generally accepted to be substantially higher than the latest published DICOM rate. We have not transacted at any unofficial market rates in 2017 and have no plans to transact at unofficial market rates in the foreseeable future. Outside of accessing the DICOM market, our Venezuelan subsidiary obtains U.S. dollars through exports. These U.S. dollars are primarily used for purchases of tomato paste and spare parts for manufacturing, as well as a limited amount of other operating costs. As of December 30, 2017, our Venezuelan subsidiary has sufficient U.S. dollars to fund these operational needs in the foreseeable future. However, further deterioration of the economic environment or regulation changes could jeopardize our export business. Our Venezuelan subsidiary has increasingly sourced production inputs locally, including tomato paste and sugar, in order to reduce reliance on U.S. dollars, which we expect to continue in the foreseeable future. As of December 30, 2017, we believe the DICOM rate is the most appropriate legally available rate at which to translate the results of our Venezuelan subsidiary. We continue to monitor the DICOM rate, and the nonmonetary assets supported by the underlying operations in Venezuela, for impairment. We remeasure the monetary assets and liabilities, as well as the operating results, of our Venezuelan subsidiary at DICOM rates. These remeasurements resulted in a nonmonetary currency devaluation loss of $36 million in 2017, $24 million in 2016, and $234 million in 2015. These amounts were recorded in other expense/(income), net, in the consolidated statements of income. In the second quarter of 2016, we assessed the nonmonetary assets of our Venezuelan subsidiary for impairment, resulting in a $53 million loss to write down property, plant and equipment, net, and prepaid spare parts, which was recorded within cost of products sold in the consolidated statement of income. In the second quarter of 2015, we reevaluated the rate used to remeasure the monetary assets and liabilities of our Venezuelan subsidiary and determined that the DICOM rate was the most appropriate legally available rate. Prior to DICOM, we used the official exchange rate of BsF6.30 per U.S. dollar. This change resulted in a nonmonetary currency devaluation loss of $234 million. Additionally, we assessed the nonmonetary assets of our Venezuelan subsidiary for impairment, which resulted in a $49 million loss to write down inventory to the lower of cost or net realizable value. This amount was recorded in cost of products sold in the consolidated statement of income. 90 Note 14.  Financing Arrangements We utilize accounts receivable securitization and factoring programs (the ""Programs"") globally for our working capital needs and to provide efficient liquidity. We operate these Programs such that we generally utilize the majority of the available aggregate cash consideration limits. We account for transfers of receivables pursuant to the Programs as a sale and remove them from our condensed consolidated balance sheets. Under the Programs, we generally receive cash consideration up to a certain limit and record a non-cash exchange for sold receivables for the remainder of the purchase price. We maintain a ""beneficial interest,"" or a right to collect cash, in the sold receivables. Cash receipts from the payments on sold receivables (which are cash receipts on the underlying trade receivables that have already been securitized in these Programs) are classified as investing activities and presented as cash receipts on sold receivables on our condensed consolidated statements of cash flows. At December 30, 2017, we had accounts receivable securitization and factoring programs in place in the U.S. and in various countries across the globe. Generally, each of these programs automatically renews annually until terminated by either party, except our U.S. securitization program, which expires in May 2018. Additionally, our U.S. securitization program utilizes a bankruptcy-remote special-purpose entity (""SPE""). The SPE is wholly-owned by a subsidiary of Kraft Heinz and its sole business consists of the purchase or acceptance, through capital contributions of receivables and related assets, from a Kraft Heinz subsidiary and subsequent transfer of such receivables and related assets to a bank. Although the SPE is included in our consolidated financial statements, it is a separate legal entity with separate creditors who will be entitled, upon its liquidation, to be satisfied out of the SPE's assets prior to any assets or value in the SPE becoming available to Kraft Heinz or its subsidiaries. The carrying value of trade receivables removed from our condensed consolidated balance sheets in connection with the Programs was $1.0 billion at December 30, 2017 and $1.0 billion at December 31, 2016. In exchange for the sale of trade receivables, we received cash of $673 million at December 30, 2017 and $904 million at December 31, 2016 and recorded sold receivables of $353 million at December 30, 2017 and $129 million at December 31, 2016. The carrying value of sold receivables approximated the fair value at December 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016. We act as servicer for certain of the Programs and did not record any related servicing assets or liabilities as of December 30, 2017 or December 31, 2016 because they were not material to the financial statements. Additionally, we enter into various structured payable arrangements to facilitate supply from our vendors. Balance sheet classification is based on the nature of the agreements with our various vendors. For certain arrangements, we classify amounts outstanding within other current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. We had approximately $188 million on our consolidated balance sheets at December 30, 2017 related to these arrangements. There were no amounts related to these arrangements on our consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2016. Note 15.  Commitments and Contingencies Legal Proceedings: We are routinely involved in legal proceedings, claims, and governmental inquiries, inspections or investigations (""Legal Matters"") arising in the ordinary course of our business. While we cannot predict with certainty the results of Legal Matters in which we are currently involved or may in the future be involved, we do not expect that the ultimate costs to resolve any of the Legal Matters that are currently pending will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Leases: Rental expenses for leases of warehouse, production, and office facilities and equipment were $183 million in 2017, $149 million in 2016, and $160 million in 2015. Minimum rental commitments under non-cancelable operating leases in effect at December 30, 2017 were (in millions): 2018 $ 103   2019 91   2020 73   2021 54   2022 45   Thereafter 165   Total $ 531 91 Purchase Obligations: We have purchase obligations for materials, supplies, property, plant and equipment, and co-packing, storage and distribution services based on projected needs to be utilized in the normal course of business. Other purchase obligations include commitments for marketing, advertising, capital expenditures, information technology, and professional services. As of December 30, 2017, our take-or-pay purchase obligations were as follows (in millions): 2018 $ 1,558   2019 724   2020 527   2021 235   2022 211   Thereafter 439   Total $ 3,694 Redeemable Noncontrolling Interest: In 2017, we commenced operations of a joint venture with a minority partner to manufacture, package, market, and distribute refrigerated soups and meal sides. We control operations and include this business in our consolidated results. Our minority partner has put options that, if it chooses to exercise them, would require us to purchase portions of its equity interest at a future date. These put options will become exercisable beginning in 2025 (on the eighth anniversary of the product launch date) at a price to be determined at that time based upon an independent third party valuation. The minority partner's put options are reflected on our consolidated balance sheets as a redeemable noncontrolling interest. We accrete the redeemable noncontrolling interest to its estimated redemption value over the term of the put options. As of December 30, 2017, we estimate the redemption value to be approximately $100 million. Note 16.  Debt Borrowing Arrangements: On July 6, 2015, together with Kraft Heinz Foods Company, our wholly owned operating subsidiary, we entered into a credit agreement (as amended, the ""Credit Agreement""), which provides for a $4.0 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility (the ""Senior Credit Facility""), which matures on July 6, 2021. No amounts were drawn on our Senior Credit Facility at December 30, 2017, at December 31, 2016, or during the years ended December 30, 2017, December 31, 2016, and January 3, 2016. The Senior Credit Facility includes a $1.0 billion sub-limit for borrowings in alternative currencies (i.e., euro, sterling, Canadian dollars, or other lawful currencies readily available and freely transferable and convertible into U.S. dollars), as well as a letter of credit sub-facility of up to $300 million. Subject to certain conditions, we may increase the amount of revolving commitments and/or add additional tranches of term loans in a combined aggregate amount of up to $1.0 billion. Any committed borrowings under the Senior Credit Facility bear interest at a variable annual rate based on LIBOR/EURIBOR/CDOR loans or an alternate base rate/Canadian prime rate, in each case subject to an applicable margin based upon the long-term senior unsecured, non-credit enhanced debt rating assigned to us. The borrowings under the Senior Credit Facility have interest rates based on, at our election, base rate, LIBOR, EURIBOR, CDOR, or Canadian prime rate plus a spread ranging from 87.5-175 basis points for LIBOR, EURIBOR, and CDOR loans, and 0-75 basis points for base rate or Canadian prime rate loans. The Senior Credit Facility contains representations, warranties, and covenants that are typical for these types of facilities. Our Senior Credit Facility requires us to maintain a minimum shareholders' equity (excluding accumulated other comprehensive income/(losses)) of at least $35 billion. We were in compliance with this covenant as of December 30, 2017. The obligations under the Credit Agreement are guaranteed by Kraft Heinz Foods Company in the case of indebtedness and other liabilities of any subsidiary borrower and by Kraft Heinz in the case of indebtedness and other liabilities of any subsidiary borrower and Kraft Heinz Foods Company. In August 2017, we repaid $600 million aggregate principal amount of our previously outstanding senior unsecured loan facility (the ""Term Loan Facility""). Accordingly, there were no amounts outstanding on the Term Loan Facility at December 30, 2017. At December 31, 2016, $600 million aggregate principal amount of our Term Loan Facility was outstanding. 92 In 2017, we obtained funding through our U.S. and European commercial paper programs. At December 30, 2017 we had $448 million of commercial paper outstanding, with a weighted average interest rate of 1.541%. At December 31, 2016, we had $642 million of commercial paper outstanding, with a weighted average interest rate of 1.074%. Long-Term Debt: Our long-term debt consists of the following: Priority 1   Maturity Dates   Interest Rates 2   Carrying Values                 December 30, 2017   December 31, 2016                 (in millions) U.S. dollar notes:                     2025 Notes(a)   Senior Secured Notes   February 15, 2025   4.875%   $ 1,192     $ 1,191   Other U.S. dollar notes(b)(c)   Senior Notes   2018-2046   1.823% - 7.125%   25,165     25,761   Euro notes(b)   Senior Notes   2023-2028   1.500% - 2.250%   3,037     2,656   Canadian dollar notes(b)   Senior Notes   2018-2020   2.214% - 2.700%   794     743   British pound sterling notes(b)(d)   Senior Notes   2027-2030   4.125% - 6.250%   712     650   Term Loan Facility(e)   Senior Unsecured Loan            -      596   Other long-term debt   Various   2018-2035   0.500% - 5.800%   56     54   Capital lease obligations                120     108   Total long-term debt               31,076     31,759   Current portion of long-term debt               2,743     2,046   Long-term debt, excluding current portion               $ 28,333     $ 29,713 1  Priority of debt indicates the order which debt would be paid if all debt obligations were due on the same day. Senior secured debt takes priority over unsecured debt. Senior debt has greater seniority than subordinated debt. 2  Floating interest rates are stated as of December 30, 2017. (a)  The 4.875% Second Lien Senior Secured Notes due February 15, 2025 (the ""2025 Notes"") are senior in right of payment of existing and future unsecured and subordinated indebtedness. (b)  We fully and unconditionally guarantee these notes, which were issued by Kraft Heinz Foods Company. (c)    Includes current year issuances (the ""New Notes"") described below. (d)  Includes £125 million aggregate principal amount of 6.250% Pound Sterling Notes due February 18, 2030 (the ""2030 Notes"") previously issued by H.J. Heinz Finance UK Plc and guaranteed by Kraft Heinz Foods Company, which we became guarantor of in connection with the 2015 Merger. (e)  We repaid the Term Loan Facility in 2017; therefore, no amounts were outstanding, nor was there an applicable maturity date or interest rate, at December 30, 2017. Our long-term debt contains customary representations, covenants, and events of default, and we were in compliance with all such covenants at December 30, 2017. At December 30, 2017, aggregate principal maturities of our long-term debt excluding capital leases were (in millions): 2018 $ 2,697   2019 355   2020 3,042   2021 691   2022 3,507   Thereafter 20,273 Debt Issuances: In the third quarter of 2017, Kraft Heinz Foods Company, our wholly owned operating subsidiary, issued New Notes, including $350 million aggregate principal amount of floating rate senior notes due 2019, $650 million aggregate principal amount of floating rate senior notes due 2021, and $500 million aggregate principal amount of floating rate senior notes due 2022. We used the net proceeds from the New Notes primarily to repay all amounts outstanding under our $600 million Term Loan Facility together with accrued interest thereon, to refinance a portion of our commercial paper program, and for other general corporate purposes. 93 Debt Issuance Costs: Debt issuance costs are reflected as a direct deduction of our long-term debt balance on the consolidated balance sheets. We incurred debt issuance costs of $53 million in 2016 and $99 million in 2015. Debt issuance costs in 2017 were insignificant. Unamortized debt issuance costs were $114 million at December 30, 2017, $124 million at December 31, 2016, and $85 million at January 3, 2016. Amortization of debt issuance costs was $16 million in 2017, $14 million in 2016, and $27 million in 2015. Debt Premium: Unamortized debt premiums are presented on the consolidated balance sheets as a direct addition to the carrying amount of debt. Unamortized debt premium, net was $505 million at December 30, 2017 and $585 million at December 31, 2016. Amortization of our debt premium, net was $81 million in 2017, $88 million in 2016, and $45 million in 2015. Debt Repayments: In June 2017, we repaid $2.0 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes that matured in the period. We funded these long-term debt repayments primarily with cash on hand and our commercial paper programs. Additionally, we repaid our $600 million aggregate principal amount Term Loan Facility in August 2017. In 2015, we recorded a $341 million loss on extinguishment of debt, which was comprised of a write-off of debt issuance costs and unamortized debt discounts of $236 million in interest expense as well as call premiums of $105 million in other expense/(income), net. Fair Value of Debt: At December 30, 2017, the aggregate fair value of our total debt was $33.0 billion as compared with a carrying value of $31.5 billion. At December 31, 2016, the aggregate fair value of our total debt was $33.2 billion as compared with a carrying value of $32.4 billion. We determined the fair value of our long-term debt using Level 2 inputs. Fair values are generally estimated based on quoted market prices for identical or similar instruments. Note 17.  Capital Stock Preferred Stock and Warrants Our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation authorizes the issuance of up to 920,000 shares of preferred stock. On June 7, 2016, we redeemed all 80,000 outstanding shares of our 9.00% cumulative compounding preferred stock, Series A (""Series A Preferred Stock"") for $8.3 billion. We funded this redemption primarily through the issuance of long-term debt in May 2016, as well as other sources of liquidity, including our commercial paper program, U.S. securitization program, and cash on hand. In connection with the redemption, all Series A Preferred Stock was canceled and automatically retired. The 80,000 shares of Series A Preferred Stock were issued in connection with the 2013 Merger, along with warrants to purchase 46 million Heinz common shares, at an exercise price of $0.01 per common share (the ""Warrants""), for an aggregate purchase price of $8.0 billion. We allocated the proceeds to the Series A Preferred Stock ($7.6 billion) and the Warrants ($367 million) on a relative fair value basis. In June 2015, Berkshire Hathaway exercised the Warrants to purchase the additional 46 million Heinz common shares, which were subsequently reclassified and changed into approximately 20 million shares of Kraft Heinz common stock. Common Stock Our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation authorizes the issuance of up to 5.0 billion shares of common stock. Immediately prior to the consummation of the 2015 Merger, each share of Heinz issued and outstanding common stock was reclassified and changed into 0.443332 of a share of Kraft Heinz common stock. All share and per share amounts have been retroactively adjusted for all historical periods presented prior to the 2015 Merger Date to give effect to this conversion. In the 2015 Merger, all outstanding shares of Kraft common stock were converted into the right to receive, on one-for-one basis, shares of Kraft Heinz common stock. 94 Shares of common stock issued, in treasury, and outstanding were (in millions of shares): Shares Issued   Treasury Shares   Shares Outstanding Balance at December 28, 2014 377      -      377   Exercise of warrants 20      -      20   Issuance of common stock to Sponsors 222      -      222   Acquisition of Kraft Foods Group, Inc. 593      -      593   Exercise of stock options, issuance of other stock awards, and other 2      -      2   Balance at January 3, 2016 1,214      -      1,214   Exercise of stock options, issuance of other stock awards, and other 5     (2 )   3   Balance at December 31, 2016 1,219     (2 )   1,217   Exercise of stock options, issuance of other stock awards, and other 2      -      2   Balance at December 30, 2017 1,221     (2 )   1,219 Note 18.  Earnings Per Share As a result of the stock conversion prior to the 2015 Merger, all per share data, numbers of shares, and numbers of equity awards outstanding were retroactively adjusted for all historical periods presented prior to the 2015 Merger Date. See Note 1, Background and Basis of Presentation, for additional information. Our earnings per common share (""EPS"") were: December 30,  2017 (52 weeks)   December 31,  2016 (52 weeks)   January 3,  2016 (53 weeks)   (in millions, except per share data) Basic Earnings Per Common Share:           Net income/(loss) attributable to common shareholders $ 10,999     $ 3,452     $ (266 ) Weighted average shares of common stock outstanding 1,218     1,217     786   Net earnings/(loss) $ 9.03     $ 2.84     $ (0.34 ) Diluted Earnings Per Common Share:           Net income/(loss) attributable to common shareholders $ 10,999     $ 3,452     $ (266 ) Weighted average shares of common stock outstanding 1,218     1,217     786   Effect of dilutive equity awards 10     9      -    Weighted average shares of common stock outstanding, including dilutive effect 1,228     1,226     786   Net earnings/(loss) $ 8.95     $ 2.81     $ (0.34 ) We use the treasury stock method to calculate the dilutive effect of outstanding equity awards in the denominator for diluted EPS. Due to the net loss attributable to common shareholders in 2015, the dilutive effects of equity awards and warrants were excluded because their inclusion would have had an anti-dilutive effect on earnings per share. Anti-dilutive shares were 2 million in 2017, 3 million in 2016, and 17 million in 2015. Note 19.  Segment Reporting We manufacture and market food and beverage products, including condiments and sauces, cheese and dairy, meals, meats, refreshment beverages, coffee, and other grocery products, throughout the world. We manage and report our operating results through four segments. We have three reportable segments defined by geographic region: United States, Canada, and Europe. Our remaining businesses are combined and disclosed as ""Rest of World"". Rest of World is comprised of two operating segments: Latin America; and Asia Pacific, Middle East, and Africa (""AMEA""). In the third quarter of 2017, we announced our plans to reorganize certain of our international businesses to better align our global geographies. These plans include moving our Middle East and Africa businesses from the AMEA segment into the Europe segment, forming the Europe, Middle East, and Africa (""EMEA"") segment. The remaining AMEA businesses will become the Asia Pacific (""APAC"") segment, which will remain in Rest of World. We expect these changes to become effective in the first quarter of 2018. As a result, we expect to restate our Europe and Rest of World segments to reflect these changes for historical periods presented in the first quarter of 2018. 95 Management evaluates segment performance based on several factors, including net sales and segment adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (""Segment Adjusted EBITDA""). Management uses Segment Adjusted EBITDA to evaluate segment performance and allocate resources. Segment Adjusted EBITDA is a tool that can assist management and investors in comparing our performance on a consistent basis by removing the impact of certain items that management believes do not directly reflect our underlying operations. These items include depreciation and amortization (excluding integration and restructuring expenses; including amortization of postretirement benefit plans prior service credits), equity award compensation expense, integration and restructuring expenses, merger costs, unrealized gains/(losses) on commodity hedges (the unrealized gains and losses are recorded in general corporate expenses until realized; once realized, the gains and losses are recorded in the applicable segment's operating results), impairment losses, gains/(losses) on the sale of a business, and nonmonetary currency devaluation (e.g., remeasurement gains and losses). In addition, consistent with the manner in which management evaluates segment performance and allocates resources, Segment Adjusted EBITDA includes the operating results of Kraft on a pro forma basis, as if Kraft had been acquired as of December 30, 2013. There are no pro forma adjustments to any of the numbers disclosed in this note to the consolidated financial statements except for the Segment Adjusted EBITDA reconciliation. Management does not use assets by segment to evaluate performance or allocate resources. Therefore, we do not disclose assets by segment.

Controls and Procedures. Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures, as of December 30, 2017, were effective and provided reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by us in reports filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is (i) recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms, and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Remediation of Previously Disclosed Material Weakness A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company's annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. As previously disclosed concurrently with the filing of our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2017, we concluded that we had a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting related to the misapplication of Accounting Standards Update 2016-15. Specifically, we did not maintain effective controls over the adoption of new accounting standards, including communication with the appropriate individuals in coming to our conclusions on the application of new standards. Our management determined that the control deficiency constituted a material weakness. During the fourth quarter of 2017, management implemented steps to improve the evaluation and documentation of new accounting standards' impacts and communication with the appropriate individuals. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, with other members of management, evaluated the changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the three months ended December 30, 2017. During the three months ended December 30, 2017, management implemented steps to improve the evaluation and documentation of new accounting standards' impacts and communication with the appropriate individuals. These changes have been designed to ensure enhanced subject matter expert input in relation to new accounting standard pronouncements. We determined that, except for the remediation activities described above, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the three months ended December 30, 2017 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Our internal control over financial reporting includes those written policies and procedures that:  pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of assets;  provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles;  provide reasonable assurance that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with management and director authorization; and  provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of assets that could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 109 Management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 30, 2017. Management based this assessment on criteria described in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on this assessment, management determined that as of December 30, 2017, we maintained effective internal control over financial reporting. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, who audited the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, has also audited the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 30, 2017, as stated in their report which appears herein under Item 8.","https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1637459/0001637459-18-000015-index.html"
"Alphabet Inc.","10-K","2018","1","ITEM 1. BUSINESS Overview As our founders Larry and Sergey wrote in the original founders' letter, ""Google is not a conventional company. We do not intend to become one."" That unconventional spirit has been a driving force throughout our history -- inspiring us to do things like rethink the mobile device ecosystem with Android and map the world with Google Maps. As part of that, our founders also explained that you could expect us to make ""smaller bets in areas that might seem very speculative or even strange when compared to our current businesses."" From the start, the company has always strived to do more, and to do important and meaningful things with the resources we have. Alphabet is a collection of businesses -- the largest of which, of course, is Google. It also includes businesses that are generally pretty far afield of our main Internet products such as Access, Calico, CapitalG, GV, Nest, Verily, Waymo, and X. We report all non-Google businesses collectively as Other Bets. Our Alphabet structure is about helping each of our businesses prosper through strong leaders and independence. Access and technology for everyone The Internet is one of the world's most powerful equalizers, capable of propelling new ideas and people forward. At Google, our mission is to make sure that information serves everyone, not just a few. So whether you're a child in a rural village or a professor at an elite university, you can access the same information. We are helping people get online by tailoring digital experiences to the needs of emerging markets. We're also making sure our core Google products are fast and useful, especially for users in areas where speed and connectivity are central concerns. Other Alphabet companies are also pursuing initiatives with similar goals. For instance, in October 2017, Project Loon within X deployed its network of stratospheric balloons to deliver basic internet connectivity to more than 100,000 people in Puerto Rico following Hurricane Maria. Moonshots Many companies get comfortable doing what they have always done, making only incremental changes. This incrementalism leads to irrelevance over time, especially in technology, where change tends to be revolutionary, not evolutionary. People thought we were crazy when we acquired YouTube and Android and when we launched Chrome, but those efforts have matured into major platforms for digital video and mobile devices and a safer, popular browser. We continue to look toward the future and continue to invest for the long-term. As we said in the original founders' letter, we will not shy away from high-risk, high-reward projects that we believe in because they are the key to our long-term success. The power of machine learning Across the company, machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) are increasingly driving many of our latest innovations. Within Google, our investments in machine learning over a decade have enabled us to build products that are smarter and more useful -- it's what allows you to use your voice to ask the Google Assistant for information, to translate the web from one language to another, to see better YouTube recommendations, and to search for people and events in Google Photos. Machine learning is also showing great promise in helping us tackle big issues, like dramatically improving the energy efficiency of our data centers. Across Other Bets, machine learning helps self-driving cars better detect and respond to others on the road, and can also improve the ability of clinicians to detect diseases such as diabetic retinopathy. Google Serving our users We have always been a company committed to making big bets that have the potential to improve the lives of millions of people. Our product innovations have made our services widely used, and our brand one of the most recognized in the world. Google's core products and platforms such as Android, Chrome, Gmail, Google Maps, Google Play, Search, and YouTube each have over one billion monthly active users. But most important, we believe we are just beginning to scratch the surface. Our vision is to remain a place of incredible creativity and innovation that uses our technical expertise to tackle big problems. As the majority of Alphabet's big bets continue to reside within Google, an important benefit of the shift to Alphabet has been the tremendous focus that we're able to have on Google's many extraordinary opportunities. 3 Table of Contents Alphabet Inc. Google's mission to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful has always been our North Star, and our products have come a long way since the company was founded nearly two decades ago. Instead of just showing ten blue links in our search results, we are increasingly able to provide direct answers -- even if you're speaking your question using Voice Search -- which makes it quicker, easier and more natural to find what you're looking for. You can also type or talk with the Google Assistant in a conversational way across multiple devices like phones, speakers, headphones, televisions and more. And with Google Lens, you can now use your phone's camera to identify an unfamiliar landmark or find a trailer from a movie poster. Over time, we have also added other services that let you access information quickly and easily -- like Google Maps, which helps you navigate to a store while showing you current traffic conditions, or Google Photos, which helps you store and organize your photos. This drive to make information more accessible has led us over the years to improve the discovery and creation of digital content, on the web and through platforms like Google Play and YouTube. And with the migration to mobile, people are consuming more digital content by watching more videos, playing more games, listening to more music, reading more books, and using more apps than ever before. Working with content creators and partners, we continue to build new ways for people around the world to find great digital content. Fueling all of these great digital experiences are powerful platforms and hardware. That's why we continue to invest in platforms like our Android mobile operating system, Chrome browser, Chrome operating system, and Daydream virtual reality platform, as well as growing our family of great hardware devices. We see tremendous potential for devices to be helpful, make your life easier, and even get better over time, by combining the best of Google's AI, software, and hardware. This is reflected in our latest generation of hardware products like the newest additions to the Google Home family called Mini and Max, Pixel 2 phone, and Pixelbook laptop. Creating beautiful products that people rely on every day is a journey that we are investing in for the long run. Google was a company built in the cloud and has been investing in infrastructure, security, data management, analytics, and AI from the very beginning. We have continued to enhance these strengths with features like data migration, modern development environments and machine learning tools to provide enterprise-ready cloud services, including Google Cloud Platform and G Suite, to our customers. Google Cloud Platform enables developers to build, test, and deploy applications on Google's highly scalable and reliable infrastructure. Our G Suite productivity tools -- which include apps like Gmail, Docs, Drive, Calendar, Hangouts, and more -- are designed with real-time collaboration and machine intelligence to help people work smarter. Because more and more of today's great digital experiences are being built in the cloud, our Google Cloud products help businesses of all sizes take advantage of the latest technology advances to operate more efficiently. How we make money The goal of our advertising business is to deliver relevant ads at just the right time and to give people useful commercial information, regardless of the device they're using. We also provide advertisers with tools that help them better attribute and measure their advertising campaigns across screens. Our advertising solutions help millions of companies grow their businesses, and we offer a wide range of products across screens and formats. We generate revenues primarily by delivering both performance advertising and brand advertising.  Performance advertising creates and delivers relevant ads that users will click on, leading to direct engagement with advertisers. Most of our performance advertisers pay us when a user engages in their ads. Performance advertising lets our advertisers connect with users while driving measurable results. For performance advertisers, AdWords, our primary auction-based advertising program, helps create simple text-based ads that appear on Google properties and the properties of Google Network Members. In addition, Google Network Members use our AdSense program to display relevant ads on their properties, generating revenues when site visitors view or click on the ads. We continue to invest in our advertising programs and make significant upgrades.  Brand advertising helps enhance users' awareness of and affinity with advertisers' products and services, through videos, text, images, and other interactive ads that run across various devices. We help brand advertisers deliver digital videos and other types of ads to specific audiences for their brand-building marketing campaigns. We have built a world-class ad technology platform for brand advertisers, agencies, and publishers to power their digital marketing businesses. We aim to ensure great user experiences by serving the right ads at the right time and by building deep partnerships with brands and agencies. We also seek to improve the measurability of brand advertising so advertisers know when their campaigns are effective. 4 Table of Contents Alphabet Inc. We have allocated substantial resources to stopping bad advertising practices and protecting users on the web. We focus on creating the best advertising experiences for our users and advertisers in many ways, ranging from filtering out invalid traffic, removing hundreds of millions of bad ads from our systems every year to closely monitoring the sites, apps, and videos where ads appear and blacklisting them when necessary to ensure that ads do not fund bad content. Beyond our advertising business, we also generate revenues in other areas, such as digital content, enterprise cloud services, and hardware. Other Bets Throughout Alphabet, we are also using technology to try and solve big problems across many industries. Alphabet's Other Bets are early-stage businesses, and our goal is for them to become thriving, successful businesses in the medium to long term. To do this, we make sure we have a strong CEO to run each company while also rigorously handling capital allocation and working to make sure each business is executing well. While these early-stage businesses naturally come with considerable uncertainty, some of them are already generating revenue and making important strides in their industries. For instance, Nest recently expanded its connected home product line by introducing the Nest Thermostat E and a new home security solution that includes the Nest Hello video doorbell, Nest Cam IQ outdoor security camera, and the Nest Secure alarm system. Our self-driving car company, Waymo, continues to progress the development and testing of its technology and now has a fleet of vehicles in Phoenix, Arizona, driving without a person behind the wheel. Life sciences company Verily has also made significant progress on key programs, like the launch of its Project Baseline study with Duke University and Stanford Medicine, and received an $800 million investment in 2017 from Temasek to accelerate its strategic programs. We continue to build these businesses thoughtfully and systematically to capitalize on the opportunities ahead. We are investing for the long term while being very deliberate about the focus, scale and pace of investments. We generate revenues from internet and TV services, licensing and R&D services, and Nest branded hardware. Competition Our business is characterized by rapid change as well as new and disruptive technologies. We face formidable competition in every aspect of our business, particularly from companies that seek to connect people with online information and provide them with relevant advertising. We face competition from:  General purpose search engines and information services, such as Baidu, Microsoft's Bing, Naver, Seznam, Verizon's Yahoo, and Yandex.  Vertical search engines and e-commerce websites, such as Amazon and eBay (e-commerce), Kayak (travel queries), LinkedIn (job queries), and WebMD (health queries). Some users will navigate directly to such content, websites, and apps rather than go through Google.  Social networks, such as Facebook, Snap, and Twitter. Some users increasingly rely on social networks for product or service referrals, rather than seeking information through traditional search engines.  Other forms of advertising, such as billboards, magazines, newspapers, radio, and television. Our advertisers typically advertise in multiple media, both online and offline.  Other online advertising platforms and networks, including Amazon, AppNexus, Criteo, and Facebook, that compete for advertisers that use AdWords, our primary auction-based advertising platform.  Providers of digital video services, such as Amazon, Facebook, Hulu, and Netflix.  Companies that design, manufacture, and market consumer electronics products, including businesses that have developed proprietary platforms.  Providers of enterprise cloud services, including Alibaba, Amazon, and Microsoft.  Digital assistant providers, such as Amazon, Apple, and Microsoft. Competing successfully in our advertising-related businesses depends heavily on our ability to deliver and distribute innovative products and technologies to the marketplace so that we can attract and retain:  Users, for whom other products and services are literally one click away, primarily on the basis of the relevance and usefulness of our search results and the features, availability, and ease of use of our products and services.  Advertisers, primarily based on our ability to generate sales leads, and ultimately customers, and to deliver their advertisements in an efficient and effective manner across a variety of distribution channels. 5 Table of Contents Alphabet Inc.  Content providers, primarily based on the quality of our advertiser base, our ability to help these partners generate revenues from advertising, and the terms of our agreements with them. Intellectual Property We rely on various intellectual property laws, confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary technology and our brand. We have registered, and applied for the registration of, U.S. and international trademarks, service marks, domain names and copyrights. We have also filed patent applications in the U.S. and foreign countries covering certain of our technology, and acquired patent assets to supplement our portfolio. We have licensed in the past, and expect that we may license in the future, certain of our rights to other parties. Culture and Employees We take great pride in our culture. We embrace collaboration and creativity, and encourage the iteration of ideas to address complex technical challenges. Transparency and open dialogue are central to how we work, and we like to ensure that company news reaches our employees first through internal channels. Despite our rapid growth, we still cherish our roots as a startup and wherever possible empower employees to act on great ideas regardless of their role or function within the company. We strive to hire great employees, with backgrounds and perspectives as diverse as those of our global users. We work to provide an environment where these talented people can have fulfilling careers addressing some of the biggest challenges in technology and society. Our employees are among our best assets and are critical for our continued success. We expect to continue investing in hiring talented employees and to provide competitive compensation programs to our employees. As of December 31, 2017, we had 80,110 full-time employees. Although we have work councils and statutory employee representation obligations in certain countries, our U.S. employees are not represented by a labor union. Competition for qualified personnel in our industry is intense, particularly for software engineers, computer scientists, and other technical staff. Seasonality Our business is affected by seasonal fluctuations in Internet usage, advertising expenditures, and underlying business trends such as traditional retail seasonality. Other Items Climate change is one of the most significant global challenges of our time, and we've long been committed to improving our energy consumption. In 2012, we set a goal to reach 100% renewable energy for our operations. While we are still performing final analysis for the year, in 2017, we purchased a total wind and solar capacity of about three gigawatts, which we expect will be enough renewables to match the energy consumption of our global operations. We continue to invest in our existing products and services as well as developing new products and services through research and product development. We often release early-stage products. We then use data and user feedback to decide if and how to invest further in those products. Research and development expenses include the vast majority of engineering and technical headcount responsible for research and development of our existing and new products and services, as well as their associated costs.

RISK FACTORS Our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to those described below, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and the trading price of our common and capital stock. Risks Related to Our Businesses and Industries We face intense competition. If we do not continue to innovate and provide products and services that are useful to users, we may not remain competitive, and our revenues and operating results could be adversely affected. Our businesses are rapidly evolving, intensely competitive, and subject to changing technologies, shifting user needs, and frequent introductions of new products and services. Competing successfully depends heavily on our ability to accurately anticipate technology developments and deliver innovative, relevant and useful products, services, and technologies to the marketplace in a timely manner. As our businesses evolve, the competitive pressure to innovate will encompass a wider range of products and services, including products and services that may be outside of our historical core business. As a result, we must continue to invest significant resources in research and development, including through acquisitions, in order to enhance our technology and our existing products and services, and introduce new products and services that people can easily and effectively use. We have many competitors in different industries. Our current and potential domestic and international competitors range from large and established companies to emerging start-ups. Some companies have longer operating histories and more established relationships with customers and users. They can use their experiences and resources in ways that could affect our competitive position, including by making acquisitions, continuing to invest heavily in research and development and in hiring talent, aggressively initiating intellectual property claims (whether or not meritorious), and continuing to compete aggressively for users, advertisers, and content providers. Emerging start-ups may be able to innovate and provide products and services faster than we can or may foresee the consumer need for products and services before us. In addition, new products and services can sometimes present new and difficult technological and legal challenges, which may negatively impact our brands and demand for our products and services and adversely impact our revenues and operating results. Our operating results would also suffer if our innovations are not responsive to the needs of our users, advertisers, and content providers; are not appropriately timed with market opportunities; or are not effectively brought to market. As technologies continue to develop, our competitors may be able to offer user experiences that are, or that are seen to be, substantially similar to or better than ours. This may force us to compete in different ways and expend significant resources in order to remain competitive. If our competitors are more successful than we are in developing compelling products or in attracting and retaining users, advertisers, and content providers, our revenues and operating results could be adversely affected. We generate substantially all of our revenues from advertising, and reduced spending by advertisers or a loss of partners could harm our advertising business. We generated over 86% of total revenues from advertising in 2017. Many of our advertisers, companies that distribute our products and services, digital publishers, and content partners can terminate their contracts with us at any time. Those partners may not continue to do business with us if we do not create more value (such as increased numbers of users or customers, new sales leads, increased brand awareness, or more effective monetization) than their available alternatives. If we do not provide superior value or deliver advertisements efficiently and competitively, we could see a decrease in revenue and other adverse impacts to our business. In addition, expenditures by advertisers tend to be cyclical, reflecting overall economic conditions and budgeting and buying patterns. Adverse macroeconomic conditions can also have a material negative impact on user activity and the demand for advertising and cause our advertisers to reduce the amounts they spend on advertising, which could adversely affect our revenues and advertising business. 7 Table of Contents Alphabet Inc. Our ongoing investment in new businesses and new products, services, and technologies is inherently risky, and could disrupt our current operations. We have invested and expect to continue to invest in new businesses, products, services, and technologies. The creation of Alphabet as a holding company in 2015 and the investments that we are making across various areas in Google and Other Bets are a reflection of our ongoing efforts to innovate and provide products and services that are useful to users. Such endeavors may involve significant risks and uncertainties, including insufficient revenues from such investments to offset any new liabilities assumed and expenses associated with these new investments, inadequate return of capital on our investments, distraction of management from current operations, use of alternative investment or compensation structures, and unidentified issues not discovered in our due diligence of such strategies and offerings that could cause us to fail to realize the anticipated benefits of such investments and incur unanticipated liabilities. Because these new ventures are inherently risky, no assurance can be given that such strategies and offerings will be successful and will not adversely affect our reputation, financial condition, and operating results. The Internet is accessed through a variety of platforms and form factors that continue to evolve with the advancement of technology and user preferences. If manufacturers and users do not widely adopt versions of our search technology, products, or operating systems developed for these devices and modalities, our business could be adversely affected. The number of people who access the Internet through devices other than desktop computers, including mobile phones, smartphones, laptops and tablets, video game consoles, voice-assisted speakers, automobiles, and television set-top devices, is increasing dramatically. The functionality and user experience associated with some alternative devices and modalities may make the use of our products and services or the generation of advertising revenue through such devices more difficult (or just different), and the versions of our products and services developed for these devices may not be compatible or compelling to users, manufacturers, or distributors of alternative devices. Each manufacturer or distributor may establish unique technical standards for its devices, and our products and services may not work or be viewable on these devices as a result. Some manufacturers may also elect not to include our products on their devices. In addition, search queries are increasingly being undertaken via apps tailored to particular devices or social media platforms, which could affect our search and advertising business over time. As new devices and platforms are continually being released, it is difficult to predict the problems we may encounter in adapting our products and services and developing competitive new products and services. We expect to continue to devote significant resources to the creation, support, and maintenance of products and services across multiple platforms and devices. If we are unable to attract and retain a substantial number of alternative device manufacturers, suppliers, distributors, developers, and users to our products and services, or if we are slow to develop products and technologies that are more compatible with alternative devices and platforms, we will fail to capture the opportunities available as consumers and advertisers continue to exist in a dynamic, multi-platform environment. Our revenue growth rate could decline over time, and we anticipate downward pressure on our operating margin in the future. Our revenue growth rate could decline over time as a result of a number of factors, including:  increasing competition,  changes in device mix, geographic mix, ongoing product and policy changes, product mix, and property mix,  the challenges in maintaining our growth rate as our revenues increase to higher levels,  the evolution of the online advertising market, including the increasing variety of online platforms for advertising, and the other markets in which we participate, and  the rate of user adoption of our products, services, and technologies. We believe our margins could experience downward pressure as a result of increasing competition and increased costs for many aspects of our business as well as the continuing shift to mobile, changes in device mix, and the contribution of new businesses to overall revenue. For instance, the margin on revenues we generate from our Google Network Members is significantly less than the margin on revenues we generate from advertising on Google properties. Consequently, our margins will experience downward pressure if a greater percentage of our revenues comes from ads placed on our Google Network Members' properties compared to revenues generated through ads placed on Google properties. Additionally, the margin we earn on revenues generated from our Google Network Members could decrease in the future if we pay an even larger percentage of advertising fees to our Google Network Members. Furthermore, in our multi-device world, we generate our advertising revenues increasingly from mobile and newer advertising formats, and the margins from the advertising revenues from these sources have generally been lower than those from traditional desktop search. We also expect our TAC paid to our distribution partners to increase due to changes in device mix between mobile, desktop, and tablet, partner mix, partner agreement terms, and the percentage of queries channeled through paid access points. 8 Table of Contents Alphabet Inc. Additionally, our margins could experience downward pressure as revenues from the sale of hardware products and cloud-based services increase as a percentage of consolidated revenues because the margin on the sale of these products and services have generally been lower than that from Google search. Furthermore, our margins could be impacted adversely if we spend a proportionately larger amount to promote new products and services or distribute certain products or if we invest more heavily in our innovation efforts across the Company (such as our Other Bets businesses) than we have historically. We are subject to increasing regulatory scrutiny that may negatively impact our business. Additionally, changes in public policies governing a wide range of topics may adversely affect our business. The growth of our company and our expansion into a variety of new fields involves a variety of new regulatory issues, and we have experienced increased regulatory scrutiny as we have grown. For instance, various regulatory agencies are reviewing aspects of our search and other businesses, which can lead to increased scrutiny from other regulators and legislators, that may affect our reputation, brand and third-party relationships. Such reviews may also result in substantial regulatory fines, changes to our business practices and other penalties, which could negatively impact our business and results of operations. We continue to cooperate with the European Commission and other regulatory authorities around the world in investigations they are conducting with respect to our business. Additionally, changes in social, political, and regulatory conditions or in laws and policies governing a wide range of topics may disrupt our business practices. These changes could negatively impact our business and results of operations in material ways. A variety of new and existing laws could subject us to claims or otherwise harm our business. We are subject to numerous U.S. and international laws and regulations covering a wide variety of subject matters. New laws and regulations (or new interpretations of existing laws and regulations) may make our products and services less useful, require us to incur substantial costs, expose us to unanticipated civil or criminal liability, or cause us to change our business practices. For example, current and new patent laws such as U.S. patent laws and European patent laws may affect the ability of companies, including us, to protect their innovations and defend against claims of patent infringement. Similarly, changes to copyright laws being considered in Europe and elsewhere may increase costs or require companies, including us, to change or cease offering certain existing services. The costs of compliance with these laws and regulations are high and are likely to increase in the future. Claims have been, or may be, threatened and filed against us under both U.S. and international laws for defamation, invasion of privacy and other tort claims, unlawful activity, patent, copyright and trademark infringement, product liability, or other theories based on the nature and content of the materials searched and the ads posted by our users, our products and services, or content generated by our users. Furthermore, many of these laws do not contemplate or address the unique issues raised by a number of our new businesses, products, services and technologies. In addition, the applicability and scope of these laws, as interpreted by the courts, remain uncertain. Other laws that could subject us to claims or otherwise harm our business include, among others:  We rely on statutory safe harbors, as set forth in the Digital Millennium Copyright Act in the United States and the E-Commerce Directive in Europe, against copyright liability for various linking, caching, and hosting activities. Any legislation or court rulings impacting these safe harbors may adversely impact us.  The General Data Protection Regulation, coming into effect in the European Union in May of 2018, which creates a range of new compliance obligations, which could cause us to change our business practices, and will increase financial penalties for noncompliance significantly.  Court decisions such as the judgment of the Court of Justice of the European Union on May 13, 2014 on the 'right to be forgotten,' which allows individuals to demand that Google remove search results about them in certain instances, may limit the content we can show to our users and impose significant operational burdens.  Court decisions that require Google to suppress content not just in the jurisdiction of the issuing court, but for all of our users worldwide, including locations where the content at issue is lawful. The Supreme Court of Canada issued such a decision against Google in June 2017, and others could treat its decision as persuasive. For instance, with respect to the 'right to be forgotten,' a follow-up case is pending before the Court of Justice of the European Union, which could result in an order to apply delisting actions under the 'right to be forgotten' worldwide.  Various U.S. and international laws that restrict the distribution of materials considered harmful to children and impose additional restrictions on the ability of online services to collect information from minors. 9 Table of Contents Alphabet Inc.  Various laws with regards to content removal and disclosure obligations, such as the recently enacted Network Enforcement Act in Germany, which may impact our businesses and operations and may subject us to significant fines if such laws are interpreted and applied in a manner inconsistent with our practices.  Data protection laws passed by many states within the U.S. and by certain countries that require notification to users when there is a security breach of personal data.  Data localization laws, which generally mandate that certain types of data collected in a particular country be stored and/or processed within that country.  Privacy laws, which could be interpreted over-broadly to limit some product offerings and increase costs. We face risks and costs overseas as our products and services are offered in international markets and may be subject to additional regulations. Any failure on our part to comply with these laws and regulations can result in negative publicity and diversion of management time and effort and may subject us to significant liabilities and other penalties. We are regularly subject to claims, suits, government investigations, and other proceedings that may result in adverse outcomes. We are regularly subject to claims, suits, and government investigations involving competition, intellectual property, privacy, consumer protection, tax, labor and employment, commercial disputes, content generated by our users, goods and services offered by advertisers or publishers using our platforms, and other matters. The manufacturing and sale of an expanded suite of products, including hardware, further exposes us to the risk of product liability and other litigation as well as consumer protection concerns related to product defects, as well as health and safety, hazardous materials usage, and other environmental concerns. We may also be subject to claims, including product warranty claims, if users experience service disruptions, failures, or other issues. In addition, our businesses face intellectual property litigation, as discussed later, that exposes us to the risk of exclusion and cease and desist orders, which could limit our ability to sell products and services. Such claims, suits, and government investigations are inherently uncertain. Regardless of the outcome, any of these types of legal proceedings can have an adverse impact on us because of legal costs, diversion of management resources, and other factors. Determining reserves for our pending litigation is a complex, fact-intensive process that requires significant judgment. It is possible that a resolution of one or more such proceedings could result in substantial fines and penalties that could adversely affect our business, consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows in a particular period. These proceedings could also result in reputational harm, criminal sanctions, consent decrees, or orders preventing us from offering certain features, functionalities, products, or services, requiring a change in our business practices or product recalls or corrections, or requiring development of non-infringing or otherwise altered products or technologies. Any of these consequences could adversely affect our business and results of operations. We may be subject to legal liability associated with providing online services or content. We host and provide a wide variety of services and products that enable users to exchange information, advertise products and services, conduct business, and engage in various online activities both domestically and internationally. The law relating to the liability of providers of these online services and products for activities of their users is still somewhat unsettled both within the U.S. and internationally. Claims have been threatened and have been brought against us for defamation, negligence, breaches of contract, copyright or trademark infringement, unfair competition, unlawful activity, tort, including personal injury, fraud, or other theories based on the nature and content of information that we publish or to which we provide links or that may be posted online or generated by us or by third parties, including our users. In addition, we are and have been and may again in the future be subject to domestic or international actions alleging that certain content we have generated or third-party content that we have made available within our services violates U.S. and international law. We also place advertisements which are displayed on third-party publishers and advertising networks properties, and we offer third-party products, services, or content. We may be subject to claims concerning these products, services, or content by virtue of our involvement in marketing, branding, broadcasting, or providing access to them, even if we do not ourselves host, operate, provide, or provide access to these products, services, or content. Defense of any such actions could be costly and involve significant time and attention of our management and other resources, which may result in monetary liabilities or penalties, and may require us to change our business in an adverse manner. Privacy concerns relating to our technology could damage our reputation and deter current and potential users or customers from using our products and services. If our security measures are breached resulting in the improper use and disclosure of user data, or if our services are subject to attacks that degrade or deny the ability of users to access our products and services, our products and services may be perceived as not 10 Table of Contents Alphabet Inc. being secure, users and customers may curtail or stop using our products and services, and we may incur significant legal and financial exposure. From time to time, concerns have been expressed about whether our products, services, or processes compromise the privacy of users, customers, and others. Concerns about our practices with regard to the collection, use, disclosure, or security of personal information or other privacy related matters, even if unfounded, could damage our reputation and adversely affect our operating results. Our products and services involve the storage and transmission of users' and customers' proprietary information, and theft and security breaches expose us to a risk of loss of this information, improper use and disclosure of such information, litigation, and potential liability. Any systems failure or compromise of our security that results in the release of our users' data, or in our or our users' ability to access such data, could seriously harm our reputation and brand and, therefore, our business, and impair our ability to attract and retain users. We expect to continue to expend significant resources to maintain state-of-the-art security protections that shield against theft and security breaches. We experience cyber attacks of varying degrees on a regular basis. Our security measures may also be breached due to employee error, malfeasance, system errors or vulnerabilities, including vulnerabilities of our vendors, suppliers, their products, or otherwise. Such breach or unauthorized access, increased government surveillance, or attempts by outside parties to fraudulently induce employees, users, or customers to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to our data or our users' or customers' data could result in significant legal and financial exposure, damage to our reputation, and a loss of confidence in the security of our products and services that could potentially have an adverse effect on our business. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently, become more sophisticated, and often are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. Additionally, cyber attacks could also compromise trade secrets and other sensitive information and result in such information being disclosed to others and becoming less valuable, which could negatively affect our business. If an actual or perceived breach of our security occurs, the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed and we could lose users and customers. Our business is subject to complex and evolving U.S. and international laws and regulation regarding privacy and data protection. Many of these laws and regulations are subject to change and uncertain interpretation and could result in claims, changes to our business practices, penalties, increased cost of operations, or declines in user growth or engagement, or otherwise harm our business. Regulatory authorities around the world are considering a number of legislative and regulatory proposals concerning data protection, including measures to ensure that encryption of users' data does not hinder law enforcement agencies' access to that data. In addition, the interpretation and application of consumer and data protection laws in the U.S., Europe and elsewhere are often uncertain and in flux. It is possible that these laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our data practices. These legislative and regulatory proposals, if adopted, and such interpretations could, in addition to the possibility of fines, result in an order requiring that we change our data practices, which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Complying with these various laws could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business. Recent legal developments in Europe have created compliance uncertainty regarding certain transfers of personal data from Europe to the United States. For example, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), coming into application in the European Union (EU) on May 25, 2018, will apply to all of our activities conducted from an establishment in the EU or related to products and services that we offer to EU users. The GDPR will create a range of new compliance obligations, which could cause us to change our business practices, and will significantly increase financial penalties for noncompliance (including possible fines of up to 4% of global annual turnover for the preceding financial year or 20 million (whichever is higher) for the most serious infringements). In addition, the European Commission in July 2016 and the Swiss Government in January 2017 approved the EU-U.S. and the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield frameworks, respectively, which are designed to allow U.S. companies that self-certify to the U.S. Department of Commerce and publicly commit to comply with the Privacy Shield requirements to freely import personal data from the EU and Switzerland. However, these frameworks face a number of legal challenges and their validity remains subject to legal, regulatory and political developments in both Europe and the U.S. This has resulted in some uncertainty, and compliance obligations could cause us to incur costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business. 11 Table of Contents Alphabet Inc. We are, and may in the future be, subject to intellectual property or other claims, which are costly to defend, could result in significant damage awards, and could limit our ability to use certain technologies in the future. Internet, technology, media, and other companies own large numbers of patents, copyrights, trademarks, and trade secrets and frequently enter into litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. In addition, patent holding companies may continue to seek to monetize patents they have purchased or otherwise obtained. As we have grown, the number of intellectual property claims against us has increased and may continue to increase as we develop new products, services, and technologies. We have had patent, copyright, and trademark infringement lawsuits filed against us claiming that certain of our products, services, and technologies infringe the intellectual property rights of others. Third parties have also sought broad injunctive relief against us by filing claims in U.S. and international courts and the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) for exclusion and cease and desist orders, which could limit our ability to sell our products or services in the U.S. or elsewhere if our products or services or those of our customers or suppliers are found to infringe the intellectual property subject to the claims. Adverse results in any of these lawsuits may include awards of substantial monetary damages, costly royalty or licensing agreements (if licenses are available at all), or orders preventing us from offering certain features, functionalities, products, or services, and may also cause us to change our business practices and require development of non-infringing products, services or technologies, which could result in a loss of revenues for us and otherwise harm our business. Many of our agreements with our customers and partners, including certain suppliers, require us to indemnify them for certain intellectual property infringement claims against them, which could increase our costs as a result of defending such claims, and may require that we pay significant damages if there were an adverse ruling in any such claims. Such customers and partners may also discontinue the use of our products, services, and technologies, as a result of injunctions or otherwise, which could result in loss of revenues and adversely impact our business. Moreover, intellectual property indemnities provided to us by our suppliers, when obtainable, may not cover all damages and losses suffered by us and our customers from covered products. Furthermore, in connection with our divestitures, we have agreed, and may in the future agree, to provide indemnification for certain potential liabilities, including those associated with intellectual property claims. Regardless of their merits, intellectual property claims are often time consuming, expensive to litigate or settle, and cause significant diversion of management attention. To the extent such claims are successful, they may have an adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. Our intellectual property rights are valuable, and any inability to protect them could reduce the value of our products, services, and brand. Our patents, trademarks, trade secrets, copyrights, and other intellectual property rights are important assets for us. Various events outside of our control pose a threat to our intellectual property rights, as well as to our products, services and technologies. For example, effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which our products and services are distributed or made available through the Internet. Also, the efforts we have taken to protect our proprietary rights may not be sufficient or effective. Although we seek to obtain patent protection for our innovations, it is possible we may not be able to protect some of these innovations. Moreover, we may not have adequate patent or copyright protection for certain innovations that later turn out to be important. Furthermore, there is always the possibility, despite our efforts, that the scope of the protection gained will be insufficient or that an issued patent may be deemed invalid or unenforceable. We also seek to maintain certain intellectual property as trade secrets. The secrecy of such trade secrets and other sensitive information could be compromised by outside parties, or by our employees, which could cause us to lose the competitive advantage resulting from these trade secrets. We also face risks associated with our trademarks. For example, there is a risk that the word ""Google"" could become so commonly used that it becomes synonymous with the word ""search."" If this happens, we could lose protection for this trademark, which could result in other people using the word ""Google"" to refer to their own products, thus diminishing our brand. Any significant impairment of our intellectual property rights could harm our business and our ability to compete. Also, protecting our intellectual property rights is costly and time consuming. Any increase in the unauthorized use of our intellectual property could make it more expensive to do business and harm our operating results. Acquisitions, joint ventures, investments, and divestitures could result in operating difficulties, dilution, and other consequences that may adversely impact our business and results of operations. Acquisitions, joint ventures, investments and divestitures are important elements of our overall corporate strategy and use of capital, and these transactions could be material to our financial condition and results of operations. We 12 Table of Contents Alphabet Inc. expect to continue to evaluate and enter into discussions regarding a wide array of potential strategic transactions. Effecting these strategic transactions could create unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures. The areas where we face risks include, among others:  Diversion of management time and focus from operating our business to challenges related to acquisitions and other strategic transactions.  Failure to successfully further develop the acquired business or technology.  Implementation or remediation of controls, procedures, and policies at the acquired company.  Integration of the acquired company's accounting, human resource, and other administrative systems, and coordination of product, engineering, and sales and marketing functions.  Transition of operations, users, and customers onto our existing platforms.  Failure to obtain required approvals on a timely basis, if at all, from governmental authorities, or conditions placed upon approval that could, among other things, delay or prevent us from completing a transaction, or otherwise restrict our ability to realize the expected financial or strategic goals of an acquisition or other strategic transaction.  In the case of foreign acquisitions, the need to integrate operations across different cultures and languages and to address the particular economic, currency, political, and regulatory risks associated with specific countries.  Cultural challenges associated with integrating employees from the acquired company into our organization, and retention of employees from the businesses we acquire.  Liability for activities of the acquired company before the acquisition, including patent and trademark infringement claims, privacy issues, violations of laws, commercial disputes, tax liabilities, and other known and unknown liabilities.  Litigation or other claims in connection with the acquired company, including claims from terminated employees, customers, former stockholders, or other third parties. Our failure to address these risks or other problems encountered in connection with our past or future acquisitions and other strategic transactions could cause us to fail to realize their anticipated benefits, incur unanticipated liabilities, and harm our business generally. Our acquisitions could also result in dilutive issuances of our equity securities, the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities, or amortization expenses, or impairment of goodwill and/or purchased long-lived assets, and restructuring charges, any of which could harm our financial condition or results. Also, the anticipated benefits or value of our acquisitions and other strategic transactions may not materialize. In connection with our divestitures, we have agreed, and may in the future agree, to provide indemnification for certain potential liabilities, which may adversely impact our financial condition or results. Our business depends on strong brands, and failing to maintain and enhance our brands would hurt our ability to expand our base of users, advertisers, content providers, and other partners. Our strong brands have significantly contributed to the success of our business. Maintaining and enhancing the brands within Google and Other Bets increases our ability to enter new categories and launch new and innovative products that better serve the needs of our users. Our brands may be negatively impacted by a number of factors, including, among others, reputational issues, third-party content shared on our platforms, data privacy issues and developments, and product or technical performance failures. For example, if we fail to appropriately respond to the sharing of objectionable content on our services or objectionable practices by advertisers, or to otherwise adequately address user concerns, our users may lose confidence in our brands. Our brands may also be negatively affected by the use of our products or services to disseminate information that is deemed to be misleading. Furthermore, if we fail to maintain and enhance equity in the Google brand, our business, operating results, and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected. Our success will depend largely on our ability to remain a technology leader and continue to provide high-quality, innovative products and services that are truly useful and play a meaningful role in people's everyday lives. 13 Table of Contents Alphabet Inc. We face a number of manufacturing and supply chain risks that, if not properly managed, could adversely impact our financial results and prospects. We face a number of risks related to manufacturing and supply chain management. These manufacturing and supply chain risks could impact our ability to supply both our products and our internet-based services. We rely on third parties to manufacture many of our assemblies and finished products, third-party arrangements for the design of some components and parts, and third party distributors, including cellular network carriers. Our business could be negatively affected if we are not able to engage third parties with the necessary capabilities or capacity on reasonable terms, or if those we engage fail to meet their obligations (whether due to financial difficulties or other reasons), or make adverse changes in the pricing or other material terms of our arrangements with them. We have in the past, and may experience in the future, supply shortages and price increases driven by raw material availability, manufacturing capacity, labor shortages, industry allocations, natural disasters and significant changes in the financial or business condition of our suppliers. We may experience shortages or other supply chain disruptions in the future that could negatively impact our operations. In addition, some of the components we use in our technical infrastructure and products are available only from a single source or limited sources, and we may not be able to find replacement vendors on favorable terms or at all in the event of a supply chain disruption. In addition, a significant hardware supply interruption could delay critical data center upgrades or expansions. We may enter into long term contracts that commit us to significant terms and conditions of supply. We may be liable for material and product that is not consumed due to market acceptance, technological change, obsolescences, quality, product recalls, and warranty issues. For instance, because many of our hardware supply contracts have volume-based pricing or minimum purchase requirements, if the volume of our hardware sales decreases or does not reach projected targets, we could face increased materials and manufacturing costs or other financial liabilities that could make our products more costly per unit to manufacture and therefore less competitive and negatively impact our financial results. Furthermore, certain of our competitors may negotiate more favorable contractual terms based on volume and other commitments that may provide them with competitive advantages and may impact our supply. Additionally, the products and services we sell or offer may have quality issues resulting from the design or manufacture of the product, or from the software used. Sometimes, these issues may be caused by components we purchase from other manufacturers or suppliers. If the quality of our products and services does not meet our customers' expectations or our products or services are found to be defective, then our sales and operating earnings, and ultimately our reputation, could be negatively impacted. We also require our suppliers and business partners to comply with law and, where applicable, our company policies regarding workplace and employment practices, data security, environmental compliance and intellectual property licensing, but we do not control them or their practices. If any of them violates laws or implements practices regarded as unethical, we could experience supply chain disruptions, canceled orders, terminations of or damage to key relationships, and damage to our reputation. If any of them fails to procure necessary license rights to third-party intellectual property, legal action could ensue that could impact the saleability of our products and expose us to financial obligations to third parties. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act includes disclosure requirements regarding the use of certain minerals mined from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries (DRC) and procedures pertaining to a manufacturer's efforts regarding the source of such minerals. SEC rules implementing these requirements may have the effect of reducing the pool of suppliers who can supply DRC conflict free components and parts, and we may not be able to obtain DRC conflict free products or supplies in sufficient quantities for our operations. Since our supply chain is complex, we may face reputational challenges with our customers, stockholders and other stakeholders if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins for the minerals used in our products. Web spam and content farms could decrease our search quality, which could damage our reputation and deter our current and potential users from using our products and services. Web spam refers to websites that attempt to violate a search engine's quality guidelines or that otherwise seek to rank higher in search results than a search engine's assessment of their relevance and utility would rank them. Although English-language web spam in our search results has been significantly reduced, and web spam in most other languages is limited, we expect web spammers will continue to seek ways to improve their rankings inappropriately. We continuously combat web spam, including through indexing technology that makes it harder for spam-like, less useful web content to rank highly. We face challenges from low-quality and irrelevant content websites, including content farms, which are websites that generate large quantities of low-quality content to help them improve their search rankings. We are continually launching algorithmic changes focused on low-quality websites. If our search results display an increasing number of web spam and content farms, this could hurt our reputation for delivering 14 Table of Contents Alphabet Inc. relevant information or reduce user traffic to our websites. In addition, as we continue to take actions to improve our search quality and reduce low-quality content, this may in the short run reduce our Google Network Members' revenues, since some of these websites are Google Network Members. Interruption or failure of our information technology and communications systems could hurt our ability to effectively provide our products and services, which could damage our reputation and harm our operating results. The availability of our products and services depends on the continuing operation of our information technology and communications systems. Our systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes, terrorist attacks, natural disasters, the effects of climate change (such as sea level rise, drought, flooding, wildfires, and increased storm severity), power loss, telecommunications failures, computer viruses, computer denial of service attacks, or other attempts to harm our systems. Some of our data centers are located in areas with a high risk of major earthquakes or other natural disasters. Our data centers are also subject to break-ins, sabotage, and intentional acts of vandalism, and to potential disruptions if the operators of certain of these facilities have financial difficulties. Some of our systems are not fully redundant, and our disaster recovery planning cannot account for all eventualities. The occurrence of a natural disaster, a decision to close a facility we are using, or other unanticipated problems at our data centers could result in lengthy interruptions in our service. In addition, our products and services are highly technical and complex and may contain errors or vulnerabilities, which could result in interruptions in our services or the failure of our systems. Our international operations expose us to additional risks that could harm our business, operating results, and financial condition. Our international operations are significant to our revenues and net income, and we plan to continue to grow internationally. International revenues accounted for approximately 53% of our consolidated revenues in 2017. In certain international markets, we have limited operating experience and may not succeed. In addition to risks described elsewhere in this section, our international operations expose us to other risks, including the following:  Restrictions on foreign ownership and investments, and stringent foreign exchange controls that might prevent us from repatriating cash earned in countries outside the U.S.  Import and export requirements, tariffs, trade disputes and barriers, and customs classifications that may prevent us from offering products or providing services to a particular market and may increase our operating costs.  Longer payment cycles in some countries, increased credit risk, and higher levels of payment fraud.  Evolving foreign laws and legal systems.  Uncertainty regarding liability for services and content, including uncertainty as a result of local laws and lack of legal precedent.  Different employee/employer relationships, existence of workers' councils and labor unions, and other challenges caused by distance, language, and cultural differences, making it harder to do business in certain jurisdictions. Additionally, changes in international local political, economic, regulatory, tax, social, and labor conditions may adversely harm our business, and compliance with complex international and U.S. laws and regulations that apply to our international operations increases our cost of doing business. These numerous and sometimes conflicting laws and regulations include, among others, internal control and disclosure rules, privacy and data protection requirements, anti-corruption laws, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and other local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials, and competition regulations, among others. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines and penalties, criminal sanctions against us, our officers, or our employees, prohibitions on the conduct of our business and on our ability to offer our products and services in one or more countries, and could also materially affect our brand, our international growth efforts, our ability to attract and retain employees, our business, and our operating results. Although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors, or agents will not violate our policies. Finally, since we conduct business in currencies other than U.S. dollars but report our financial results in U.S. dollars, we face exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Although we hedge a portion of our international currency exposure, significant fluctuations in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies may adversely affect our revenues and earnings. Additionally, hedging programs are inherently risky and could expose us to additional risks that could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. 15 Table of Contents Alphabet Inc. Our operating results may fluctuate, which makes our results difficult to predict and could cause our results to fall short of expectations. Our operating results may fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, many outside of our control. As a result, comparing our operating results on a period-to-period basis may not be meaningful, and you should not rely on our past results as an indication of our future performance. Our quarterly, year-to-date, and annual expenses as a percentage of our revenues may differ significantly from our historical or projected rates. Our operating results in future quarters may fall below expectations. Any of these events could cause our stock price to fall. Each of the risk factors listed in this section in addition to the following factors may affect our operating results:  Our ability to continue to attract and retain users to our products and services.  Our ability to monetize (or generate revenues from) traffic on Google properties and our Google Network Members' properties across various devices.  Revenue fluctuations caused by changes in device mix, geographic mix, ongoing product and policy changes, product mix, and property mix.  The amount of revenues and expenses generated and incurred in currencies other than U.S. dollars, and our ability to manage the resulting risk through our foreign exchange risk management program.  The amount and timing of operating costs and expenses and capital expenditures related to the maintenance and expansion of our businesses, operations, and infrastructure.  Our focus on long-term goals over short-term results.  The results of our acquisitions, divestitures, and our investments in risky projects, including new businesses, products, services, and technologies.  Our ability to keep our products and services operational at a reasonable cost and without service interruptions.  Our ability to attract user adoption of and generate significant revenues from new products, services, and technologies in which we have invested considerable time and resources.  The seasonal fluctuations in Internet usage, advertising spending, and underlying business trends such as traditional retail seasonality. Our rapid growth has tended to mask the cyclicality and seasonality of our business. As our growth rate has slowed, the cyclicality and seasonality in our business has become more pronounced and caused our operating results to fluctuate. Because our businesses are changing and evolving, our historical operating results may not be useful to you in predicting our future operating results. If we were to lose the services of key personnel, we may not be able to execute our business strategy. Our future success depends in a large part upon the continued service of key members of our senior management team. In particular, Larry Page and Sergey Brin are critical to the overall management of Alphabet and its subsidiaries, and they, along with Sundar Pichai, the Chief Executive Officer of Google, play an important role in the development of our technology. They also play a key role in maintaining our culture and setting our strategic direction. All of our executive officers and key employees are at-will employees, and we do not maintain any key-person life insurance policies. The loss of key personnel could seriously harm our business. We rely on highly skilled personnel and, if we are unable to retain or motivate key personnel, hire qualified personnel, or maintain our corporate culture, we may not be able to grow effectively. Our performance largely depends on the talents and efforts of highly skilled individuals. Our future success depends on our continuing ability to identify, hire, develop, motivate, and retain highly skilled personnel for all areas of our organization. Competition in our industry for qualified employees is intense, and certain of our competitors have directly targeted our employees. In addition, our compensation arrangements, such as our equity award programs, may not always be successful in attracting new employees and retaining and motivating our existing employees. Our continued ability to compete effectively depends on our ability to attract new employees and to retain and motivate our existing employees. In addition, we believe that our corporate culture fosters innovation, creativity, and teamwork. As our organization grows, and we are required to implement more complex organizational management structures, particularly in light of our holding company structure, we may find it increasingly difficult to maintain the beneficial aspects of our corporate culture. This could negatively impact our future success. 16 Table of Contents Alphabet Inc. Our business depends on continued and unimpeded access to the Internet by us and our users. Internet access providers may be able to restrict, block, degrade, or charge for access to certain of our products and services, which could lead to additional expenses and the loss of users and advertisers. Our products and services depend on the ability of our users to access the Internet, and certain of our products require significant bandwidth to work effectively. Currently, this access is provided by companies that have significant market power in the broadband and internet access marketplace, including incumbent telephone companies, cable companies, mobile communications companies, and government-owned service providers. Some of these providers have taken, or have stated that they may take measures, including legal actions, that could degrade, disrupt, or increase the cost of user access to certain of our products by restricting or prohibiting the use of their infrastructure to support or facilitate our offerings, or by charging increased fees to us or our users to provide our offerings. Some jurisdictions have adopted regulations prohibiting certain forms of discrimination by Internet access providers, but there is substantial uncertainty in the United States and elsewhere regarding such protections. In addition, in some jurisdictions, our products and services have been subject to government-initiated restrictions or blockages. Such interference could result in a loss of existing users, advertisers, and goodwill, and increased costs, and could impair our ability to attract new users and advertisers, thereby harming our revenues and growth. New and existing technologies could block ads online, which would harm our business. Technologies have been developed that enable users to block the display of ads altogether and some providers of online services have integrated technologies that could potentially impair the core functionality of third-party digital advertising. Most of our Google revenues are derived from fees paid to us in connection with the display of ads online. As a result, such technologies and tools could adversely affect our operating results. We are exposed to fluctuations in the market values of our investments. Given the global nature of our business, we have investments both domestically and internationally. Market values of these investments can be negatively impacted by liquidity, credit deterioration or losses, financial results, foreign exchange rates, changes in interest rates, or other factors. As a result, the value or liquidity of our cash equivalents and marketable securities could decline and result in a material impairment, which could materially adversely affect our financial condition and operating results. We could be subject to changes in tax rates, the adoption of new U.S. or international tax legislation, or exposure to additional tax liabilities. Our future income taxes could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions that have lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions that have higher statutory tax rates, the net gains and losses recognized by legal entities on certain hedges and related hedged intercompany and other transactions under our foreign exchange risk management program, changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets or liabilities, or changes in tax laws, regulations, or accounting principles, as well as certain discrete items. In addition, we are subject to regular review and audit by both domestic and foreign tax authorities. As a result, we have received, and may in the future receive, assessments in multiple jurisdictions on various tax-related assertions, including transfer pricing adjustments or permanent establishment. Any adverse outcome of such a review or audit could have a negative effect on our operating results and financial condition. In addition, the determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities requires significant judgment, and there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Although we believe our estimates are reasonable, the ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements and may materially affect our financial results in the period or periods for which such determination is made. Furthermore, due to shifting economic and political conditions, tax policies, laws or rates in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change, which could materially affect our financial position and results of operations. The ongoing effects of the Tax Act and the refinement of provisional estimates could make our results difficult to predict. Our effective tax rate may fluctuate in the future as a result of the Tax Act, which was enacted on December 22, 2017. The Tax Act introduces significant changes to U.S. income tax law that will have a meaningful impact on our provision for income taxes. Accounting for the income tax effects of the Tax Act requires significant judgments and estimates in the interpretation and calculations of the provisions of the Tax Act. Due to the timing of the enactment and the complexity involved in applying the provisions of the Tax Act, we made reasonable estimates of the effects and recorded provisional amounts in our financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2017. The U.S. Treasury Department, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), and other standard-setting bodies may issue guidance on how the provisions of the Tax Act will be applied or otherwise administered that is 17 Table of Contents Alphabet Inc. different from our interpretation. As we collect and prepare necessary data, and interpret the Tax Act and any additional guidance issued by the IRS or other standard-setting bodies, we may make adjustments to the provisional amounts that could materially affect our financial position and results of operations as well as our effective tax rate in the period in which the adjustments are made. Risks Related to Ownership of Our Stock The trading price for our Class A common stock and non-voting Class C capital stock may continue to be volatile. The trading price of our stock has at times experienced substantial price volatility and may continue to be volatile. For example, from January 1, 2017 through December 31, 2017, the closing price of our Class A common stock ranged from $807.77 per share to $1,085.09 per share, and the closing price of our Class C capital stock ranged from $786.14 to $1,077.14 per share. In addition to the factors discussed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the trading price of our Class A common stock and Class C capital stock may fluctuate widely in response to various factors, many of which are beyond our control, including, among others:  Quarterly variations in our results of operations or those of our competitors.  Announcements by us or our competitors of acquisitions, divestitures, investments, new products, significant contracts, commercial relationships, or capital commitments.  Recommendations by securities analysts or changes in earnings estimates.  Announcements about our earnings that are not in line with analyst expectations, the risk of which is enhanced because it is our policy not to give guidance on earnings.  Announcements by our competitors of their earnings that are not in line with analyst expectations.  Commentary by industry and market professionals about our products, strategies, and other matters affecting our business and results, regardless of its accuracy.  The volume of shares of Class A common stock and Class C capital stock available for public sale.  Sales of Class A common stock and Class C capital stock by us or by our stockholders (including sales by our directors, executive officers, and other employees).  Short sales, hedging, and other derivative transactions on shares of our Class A common stock and Class C capital stock.  The perceived values of Class A common stock and Class C capital stock relative to one another.  Our share repurchase program. In addition, the stock market in general, which can be impacted by various factors, including overall economic and political conditions, and the market for technology companies in particular, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. These broad market and industry factors may harm the market price of our Class A common stock and our Class C capital stock regardless of our actual operating performance. We cannot guarantee that our share repurchase program will be fully consummated or that our share repurchase program will enhance long-term stockholder value, and share repurchases could increase the volatility of the price of our stock and could diminish our cash reserves. In October 2016, our board of directors authorized our company to repurchase up to $7,019,340,976.83 of our Class C capital stock. In January 2018, our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to an additional$8,589,869,056 of our Class C capital stock. The repurchase program does not have an expiration date. The share repurchase program, authorized by our board of directors, does not obligate Alphabet to repurchase any specific dollar amount or to acquire any specific number of shares. The share repurchase program could affect the price of our stock and increase volatility and may be suspended or terminated at any time, which may result in a decrease in the trading price of our stock. The concentration of our stock ownership limits our stockholders' ability to influence corporate matters. Our Class B common stock has 10 votes per share, our Class A common stock has one vote per share, and our Class C capital stock has no voting rights. As of December 31, 2017, Larry, Sergey, and Eric E. Schmidt beneficially owned approximately 92.7% of our outstanding Class B common stock, which represented approximately 56.7% of 18 Table of Contents Alphabet Inc. the voting power of our outstanding capital stock. Larry, Sergey, and Eric therefore have significant influence over management and affairs and over all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and significant corporate transactions, such as a merger or other sale of our company or our assets, for the foreseeable future. In addition, because our Class C capital stock carries no voting rights (except as required by applicable law), the issuance of the Class C capital stock, including in future stock-based acquisition transactions and to fund employee equity incentive programs, could prolong the duration of Larry and Sergey's current relative ownership of our voting power and their ability to elect all of our directors and to determine the outcome of most matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders. Together with Eric, they would also continue to be able to control any required stockholder vote with respect to certain change in control transactions involving Alphabet (including an acquisition of Alphabet by another company). This concentrated control limits or severely restricts our stockholders' ability to influence corporate matters and, as a result, we may take actions that our stockholders do not view as beneficial. As a result, the market price of our Class A common stock and our Class C capital stock could be adversely affected. Provisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could discourage a takeover that stockholders may consider favorable. Provisions in Alphabet's certificate of incorporation and bylaws may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control or changes in our management. These provisions include the following:  Our certificate of incorporation provides for a tri-class capital stock structure. As a result of this structure, Larry, Sergey, and Eric have significant influence over all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and significant corporate transactions, such as a merger or other sale of our company or our assets. This concentrated control could discourage others from initiating any potential merger, takeover, or other change of control transaction that other stockholders may view as beneficial. As noted above, the issuance of the Class C capital stock could have the effect of prolonging the influence of Larry, Sergey, and Eric.  Our board of directors has the right to elect directors to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of the board of directors or the resignation, death, or removal of a director, which prevents stockholders from being able to fill vacancies on our board of directors.  Our stockholders may not act by written consent. As a result, a holder, or holders, controlling a majority of our capital stock would not be able to take certain actions without holding a stockholders' meeting.  Our certificate of incorporation prohibits cumulative voting in the election of directors. This limits the ability of minority stockholders to elect director candidates.  Stockholders must provide advance notice to nominate individuals for election to the board of directors or to propose matters that can be acted upon at a stockholders' meeting. These provisions may discourage or deter a potential acquirer from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect the acquirer's own slate of directors or otherwise attempting to obtain control of our company.  Our board of directors may issue, without stockholder approval, shares of undesignated preferred stock. The ability to issue undesignated preferred stock makes it possible for our board of directors to issue preferred stock with voting or other rights or preferences that could impede the success of any attempt to acquire us. As a Delaware corporation, we are also subject to certain Delaware anti-takeover provisions. Under Delaware law, a corporation may not engage in a business combination with any holder of 15% or more of its outstanding voting stock unless the holder has held the stock for three years or, among other things, the board of directors has approved the transaction. Our board of directors could rely on Delaware law to prevent or delay an acquisition of us. Risks Related to Our Holding Company Reorganization As a holding company, Alphabet is dependent on the operations and funds of its subsidiaries. On October 2, 2015, we completed a reorganization pursuant to which Alphabet became a holding company with no business operations of its own. Alphabet's only significant assets are the outstanding equity interests in its subsidiaries, including Google. As a result, we rely on cash flows from subsidiaries to meet our obligations, including to service any debt obligations of Alphabet. We may not obtain the anticipated benefits of our reorganization into a holding company structure. We believe that our holding company reorganization and the current operating structure increases management scale and allows us to focus on running our diverse businesses independently with the goal of maximizing each business' potential. The benefits of this reorganization may not be obtained if circumstances prevent us from taking 19 Table of Contents Alphabet Inc. advantage of the strategic and business opportunities that we expect it may afford us. As a result, we may incur the costs of a holding company structure without realizing the benefits, which could adversely affect our reputation, financial condition, and operating results. Alphabet's management is dedicating significant effort to the Other Bets' operating structures and business operations. These efforts may divert management's focus and resources from Alphabet's overall business, corporate initiatives, or strategic opportunities, which could have an adverse effect on our businesses, results of operations, financial condition, or prospects. Additionally, our subsidiaries may be restricted in their ability to pay cash dividends or to make other distributions to Alphabet, as the new holding company.","ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Please read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included under Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Trends in Our Business The following trends have contributed to the results of our consolidated operations, and we anticipate that they will continue to impact our future results: Users' behaviors and advertising continue to shift online as the digital economy evolves. The continuing shift from an offline to online world has contributed to the growth of our business since inception, resulting in increasing revenues, and we expect that this online shift will continue to benefit our business. As online advertising evolves, we continue to expand our product offerings which may impact our monetization. As interactions between users and advertisers change and as online user behavior evolves, we continue to expand and evolve our product offerings to serve their changing needs. Over time, we expect our monetization trends to fluctuate. For example, we have seen an increase in YouTube engagement ads, which monetize at a lower rate than traditional desktop search ads. Additionally, we continue to see a shift to programmatic buying which presents opportunities for advertisers to connect with the right user, in the right moment, in the right context. Programmatic buying has a different monetization profile than traditional advertising buying on Google properties. Users are increasingly using multiple devices and modalities to access our products and services, and our advertising revenues are increasingly coming from mobile and other new formats. Our users are accessing the Internet via multiple devices and modalities and want to feel connected no matter where they are or what they are doing. We seek to expand our products and services to stay in front of this shift in order to maintain and grow our business. We generate our advertising revenues increasingly from mobile and newer advertising formats, and the margins from the advertising revenues from these sources have generally been lower than those from traditional desktop search. Accordingly, we expect TAC paid to our distribution partners to increase due to changes in device mix between mobile, desktop, and tablet, partner mix, partner agreement terms, and the percentage of queries channeled through paid access points. We expect these trends to continue to put pressure on our overall margins. As users in developing economies increasingly come online, our revenues from international markets continue to increase and movements in foreign exchange rates impact such revenues. The shift to online, as well as the advent of the multi-device world, has brought opportunities outside of the U.S., including in emerging markets, and we continue to develop localized versions of our products and relevant advertising programs useful to our users in these markets. This has led to a trend of increased revenues from international markets over time and we expect that our results will continue to be impacted by our performance in these markets, particularly as low-cost mobile devices become more available. Our international revenues represent a significant portion of our revenues and are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar. While we have a foreign exchange risk management program designed to reduce our exposure to these fluctuations, this program does not fully offset their effect on our revenues and earnings. The portion of our revenues that we derive from non-advertising revenues is increasing and may impact margins. Non-advertising revenues have grown over time. We expect this trend to continue as we focus on expanding our offerings to our users through products and services like Google Cloud, Google Play, hardware products, and YouTube subscriptions. Across these initiatives, we currently derive non-advertising revenues primarily from sales of apps, in-app purchases, digital content products, and hardware; and licensing and service fees including fees received for Google Cloud offerings. The margins on these non-advertising businesses vary significantly and may be lower than the margins on our advertising business. A number of our Other Bets initiatives are in their initial development stages, and as such, the sources of revenues from these businesses could change over time and the revenues could be volatile. 26 Table of Contents Alphabet Inc. As we continue to look for new ways to serve our users and expand our businesses, we will invest heavily in R&D and our capital expenditures will continue to fluctuate. We continue to make significant research and development (R&D) investments in areas of strategic focus such as advertising, cloud, machine learning, and search, as well as in new products and services. The amount of our capital expenditures has fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate in the long term as we invest heavily in our systems, data centers, real estate and facilities, and information technology infrastructure. In addition, acquisitions remain an important part of our strategy and use of capital, and we expect to continue to spend cash on acquisitions and other investments. These acquisitions generally enhance the breadth and depth of our offerings, as well as expand our expertise in engineering and other functional areas.  Our employees are critical to our success and we expect to continue investing in them. Our employees are among our best assets and are critical for our continued success. Their energy and talent drive Alphabet and create our success. We expect to continue hiring talented employees around the globe and to provide competitive compensation programs to our employees. Executive Overview of Results Below are our key financial results for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017 (consolidated unless otherwise noted):  Revenues of $110.9 billion and revenue growth of 23% year over year, constant currency revenue growth of 24% year over year.  Google segment revenues of $109.7 billion with revenue growth of 23% year over year and Other Bets revenues of $1.2 billion with revenue growth of 49% year over year.  Revenues from the United States, EMEA, APAC, and Other Americas were $52.4 billion, $36.0 billion, $16.2 billion, and $6.1 billion, respectively.  Cost of revenues was $45.6 billion, consisting of TAC of $21.7 billion and other cost of revenues of $23.9 billion. Our TAC as a percentage of advertising revenues was 23%.  Operating expenses (excluding cost of revenues) were $39.1 billion.  Income from operations was $26.1 billion.  Effective tax rate was 53%.  Net income was $12.7 billion with diluted net income per share of $18.00.  Operating cash flow was $37.1 billion.  Capital expenditures were $13.2 billion.  Number of employees was 80,110 as of December 31, 2017. Information about Segments We operate our business in multiple operating segments. Google is our only reportable segment. None of our other segments meet the quantitative thresholds to qualify as reportable segments; therefore, the other operating segments are combined and disclosed below as Other Bets. Our reported segments are:  Google  -  Google includes our main products such as Ads, Android, Chrome, Commerce, Google Cloud, Google Maps, Google Play, Hardware, Search, and YouTube. Our technical infrastructure and some newer efforts like virtual reality are also included in Google. Google generates revenues primarily from advertising; sales of apps, in-app purchases, digital content products, and hardware; and licensing and service fees, including fees received for Google Cloud offerings.  Other Bets  -  Other Bets is a combination of multiple operating segments that are not individually material. Other Bets includes businesses such as Access, Calico, CapitalG, GV, Nest, Verily, Waymo, and X. Revenues from the Other Bets are derived primarily through the sales of internet and TV services through Fiber, sales of Nest products and services, and licensing and R&D services through Verily. Please refer to Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information. 27 Table of Contents Alphabet Inc.

Management views these as important metrics for understanding our business. Paid clicks for our Google properties represent engagement by users and include clicks on advertisements by end-users related to searches on Google.com, clicks related to advertisements on other owned and operated properties including Gmail, Google Maps, and Google Play, and viewed YouTube engagement ads. Paid clicks for our Google Network Members' properties include clicks by end-users related to advertisements served on Google Network Members' properties participating in AdMob, AdSense for Content, and AdSense for Search. In some cases, such as programmatic and reservation based advertising buying, we primarily charge advertisers by impression; while growing, this represents a small part of our consolidated revenues base. Cost-per-click is defined as click-driven revenues divided by our total number of paid clicks and represents the average amount we charge advertisers for each engagement by users. We periodically review, refine and update our methodologies for monitoring, gathering, and counting the number of paid clicks and for identifying the revenues generated by click activity. 28 Table of Contents Alphabet Inc. In the first quarter of 2017, we refined our methodology for paid clicks and cost-per-click to include additional categories of TrueView engagement ads and exclude non-engagement based trial ad formats. This change resulted in a modest increase in growth of paid clicks and a modest decrease in growth of cost-per-click. For comparison purposes, we have included updated data for historical periods in the table below: Three Months Ended   Year Ended   Mar 31, 2016   Jun 30, 2016   Sep 30, 2016   Dec 31, 2016   Dec 31, 2016 Year-over-year change                   Aggregate paid clicks 29  %   28  %   32  %   39  %   34  % Paid clicks on Google properties 38  %   36  %   41  %   47  %   43  % Paid clicks on Google Network Members' properties 2  %   0  %   1  %   7  %   3  %                     Aggregate cost-per-click (8 )%   (6 )%   (10 )%   (17 )%   (11 )% Cost-per-click on Google properties (11 )%   (8 )%   (12 )%   (18 )%   (13 )% Cost-per-click on Google Network Members' properties (8 )%   (8 )%   (14 )%   (19 )%   (13 )%                     Quarter-over-quarter change                   Aggregate paid clicks (2 )%   7  %   9  %   22  %   N/A   Paid clicks on Google properties (3 )%   9  %   11  %   25  %   N/A   Paid clicks on Google Network Members' properties 4  %   (3 )%   1  %   6  %   N/A                       Aggregate cost-per-click (1 )%   (1 )%   (5 )%   (10 )%   N/A   Cost-per-click on Google properties 1  %   (2 )%   (6 )%   (12 )%   N/A   Cost-per-click on Google Network Members' properties (12 )%   (2 )%   (6 )%   0  %   N/A Our advertising revenue growth, as well as the change in paid clicks and cost-per-click on Google properties and Google Network Members' properties and the correlation between these items, have fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate because of various factors, including:  advertiser competition for keywords;  changes in advertising quality or formats;  changes in device mix;  changes in foreign currency exchange rates;  fees advertisers are willing to pay based on how they manage their advertising costs;  general economic conditions;  growth rates of revenues from Google properties, including YouTube, compared to growth rates of revenues from Google Network Members' properties;  seasonality;  shift in the proportion of non-click based revenues generated on Google properties and Google Network Members' properties, including an increase in programmatic and reservation based advertising buying; and  traffic growth in emerging markets compared to more mature markets and across various advertising verticals and channels. Our advertising revenue growth rate has fluctuated over time as a result of a number of factors, including challenges in maintaining our growth rate as revenues increase to higher levels, changes in our product mix, increasing competition, query growth rates, our investments in new business strategies, shifts in the geographic mix of our revenues, and the evolution of the online advertising market. We also expect that our revenue growth rate will continue to be affected by evolving user preferences, the acceptance by users of our products and services as they are delivered on diverse devices and modalities, our ability to create a seamless experience for both users and advertisers, and movements in foreign currency exchange rates. 29 Table of Contents Alphabet Inc. Google properties The following table presents our Google properties revenues (in millions), and changes in our paid clicks and cost-per-click (expressed as a percentage): Year Ended December 31,   2015   2016   2017 Google properties revenues $ 52,357     $ 63,785     $ 77,788   Google properties revenues as a percentage of Google segment revenues 70.2 %   71.3  %   70.9  % Paid clicks change     43  %   54  % Cost-per-click change     (13 )%   (21 )% Google properties revenues consist primarily of advertising revenues that are generated on:  Google search properties which includes revenues from traffic generated by search distribution partners who use Google.com as their default search in browsers, toolbars, etc.; and  Other Google owned and operated properties like Gmail, Google Maps, Google Play, and YouTube. Our Google properties revenues increased $14,003 million from 2016 to 2017. The growth was primarily driven by increases in mobile search resulting from ongoing growth in user adoption and usage, as well as continued growth in advertiser activity. We also experienced growth in YouTube driven primarily by video advertising, as well as growth in desktop search due to improvements in ad formats and delivery. The growth was partially offset by the general strengthening of the U.S. dollar compared to certain foreign currencies. The number of paid clicks through our advertising programs on Google properties increased from 2016 to 2017 due to growth in YouTube engagement ads, increases in mobile search queries, improvements we have made in ad formats and delivery, and continued global expansion of our products, advertisers and user base. The positive impact on our revenues from an increase in paid clicks was partially offset by a decrease in the cost-per-click paid by our advertisers from 2016 to 2017. The decrease in cost-per-click was primarily driven by continued growth in YouTube engagement ads where cost-per-click remains lower than on our other advertising platforms. Cost-per-click was also impacted by changes in device mix, geographic mix, ongoing product changes, product mix, property mix, and fluctuations of the U.S. dollar compared to certain foreign currencies. Our Google properties revenues increased $11,428 million from 2015 to 2016 and also increased as a percentage of Google segment revenues. The growth was primarily driven by increases in mobile search most notably due to ongoing improvements in ad formats and delivery launched during 2016. We also experienced growth in YouTube revenue driven primarily by video advertising across TrueView with a growing contribution from ad buying on DoubleClick Bid Manager, as well as improvements in ad formats and delivery. The growth was partially offset by the general strengthening of the U.S. dollar compared to certain foreign currencies. The number of paid clicks through our advertising programs on Google properties increased from 2015 to 2016 due to growth in the adoption of YouTube engagement ads, improvements we have made in ad formats and delivery, and continued global expansion of our products, advertisers, and user base across all platforms, particularly mobile. The positive impact on our revenues from paid clicks was partially offset by a decrease in the cost-per-click paid by our advertisers. The decrease in cost-per-click was primarily driven by continued growth in YouTube engagement ads where cost-per-click remains lower than on our other advertising platforms, and also impacted by changes in device mix, property mix, product mix, geographic mix, ongoing product changes, and the general strengthening of the U.S. dollar compared to certain foreign currencies. Google Network Members' properties The following table presents our Google Network Members' properties revenues (in millions) and changes in our paid clicks and cost-per-click (expressed as a percentage): Year Ended December 31,   2015   2016   2017 Google Network Members' properties revenues $ 15,033     $ 15,598     $ 17,587   Google Network Members' properties revenues as a percentage of Google segment revenues 20.2 %   17.4  %   16.0  % Paid clicks change     3  %   10  % Cost-per-click change     (13 )%   (9 )% 30 Table of Contents Alphabet Inc. Google Network Members' properties revenues consist primarily of advertising revenues generated from ads placed on Google Network Member properties through:  AdMob;  AdSense (such as AdSense for Content, AdSense for Search, etc.); and  DoubleClick AdExchange. Our Google Network Members' properties revenues increased $1,989 million from 2016 to 2017. The growth was primarily driven by strength in both programmatic advertising buying and AdMob, offset by a decline in our traditional AdSense businesses and the general strengthening of the U.S. dollar compared to certain foreign currencies. The increase in paid clicks from 2016 to 2017 resulted primarily from growth in AdMob and an increase from our traditional AdSense for Search business. The positive impact on our revenues from an increase in paid clicks was partially offset by a decrease in the cost-per-click paid by our advertisers. The changes in cost-per-click from 2016 to 2017 was impacted by changes in device mix, geographic mix, ongoing product and policy changes, product mix, property mix, and fluctuations of the U.S. dollar compared to certain foreign currencies. Our Google Network Members' properties revenues increased $565 million from 2015 to 2016. The growth was primarily driven by strength in programmatic advertising buying as well as strength in AdMob, offset by a decline in our traditional AdSense business and the general strengthening of the U.S. dollar compared to certain foreign currencies. The increase in paid clicks from 2015 to 2016 resulted from the growth in AdMob offset by declines in AdSense. The decrease in cost-per-click paid by our advertisers from 2015 to 2016 resulted from changes in the product mix of Google Network Members advertising revenues, ongoing product and policy changes, changes in property and device mix, geographic mix, and relative fluctuations of the U.S. dollar compared to certain foreign currencies. Google other revenues The following table presents our Google other revenues (in millions): Year Ended December 31,   2015   2016   2017 Google other revenues $ 7,154     $ 10,080     $ 14,277   Google other revenues as a percentage of Google segment revenues 9.6 %   11.3 %   13.0 % Google other revenues consist primarily of revenues from:  Apps, in-app purchases, and digital content in the Google Play store;  Google Cloud offerings; and  Hardware. Our Google other revenues increased $4,197 million from 2016 to 2017. The increase was primarily driven by revenues from Google Cloud offerings, hardware sales, and revenues from Google Play, largely relating to in-app purchases (revenues which we recognize net of payout to developers). Our Google other revenues increased $2,926 million from 2015 to 2016 and increased as a percentage of Google segment revenues. These increases were primarily due to the growth in revenues from Google Play, primarily relating to in-app purchases (revenues which we recognize net of payout to developers), hardware sales, and Google Cloud offerings. Other Bets The following table presents our Other Bets revenues (in millions): Year Ended December 31,   2015   2016   2017 Other Bets revenues $ 445     $ 809     $ 1,203   Other Bets revenues as a percentage of total revenues 0.6 %   0.9 %   1.1 % Other Bets revenues consist primarily of revenues and sales from:  Internet and TV services;  Licensing and R&D services; and  Nest branded hardware. 31 Table of Contents Alphabet Inc. Our Other Bets revenues increased $394 million from 2016 to 2017. The increase was primarily driven by revenues from sales of Nest branded hardware, Fiber internet and TV services, and Verily licensing and R&D services. Our Other Bets revenues increased $364 million from 2015 to 2016 and increased as a percentage of consolidated revenues. These increases were primarily driven by sales of Nest branded hardware and revenues from Fiber internet and TV services. There was also an increase in revenues from Verily licensing and R&D services from 2015 to 2016. Due to the early stage of our Other Bets businesses and because their revenues aggregate a number of businesses operating in different industries, our Other Bets revenues may fluctuate in future periods. Additionally, our Other Bets revenues may fluctuate due to one-time items. Revenues by Geography The following table presents our revenues by geography as a percentage of revenues, determined based on the billing addresses of our customers: Year Ended December 31,   2015   2016   2017 United States 46 %   47 %   47 % EMEA 35 %   34 %   33 % APAC 14 %   14 %   15 % Other Americas 5 %   5 %   5 % For the amounts of revenues by geography, please refer to Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Use of Constant Currency Revenues and Constant Currency Revenue Growth The impact of currency exchange rates on our business is an important factor in understanding period to period comparisons. Our international revenues are favorably impacted as the U.S. dollar weakens relative to other foreign currencies, and unfavorably impacted as the U.S. dollar strengthens relative to other foreign currencies. Our international revenues are also favorably impacted by net hedging gains and unfavorably impacted by net hedging losses. We use non-GAAP constant currency revenues and constant currency revenue growth for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. We believe the presentation of results on a constant currency basis in addition to GAAP results helps improve the ability to understand our performance because they exclude the effects of foreign currency volatility that are not indicative of our core operating results. Constant currency information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant period over period. We define constant currency revenues as total revenues excluding the impact of foreign exchange rate movements and hedging activities, and use it to determine the constant currency revenue growth on a year-on-year basis. Constant currency revenues are calculated by translating current period revenues using prior period exchange rates, as well as excluding any hedging impacts realized in the current period. Constant currency revenue growth (expressed as a percentage) is calculated by determining the increase in current period revenues over prior period revenues where current period foreign currency revenues are translated using prior period exchange rates and hedging impacts are excluded from revenues of both periods. These results should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, results reported in accordance with GAAP. Results on a constant currency basis, as we present them, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies and are not a measure of performance presented in accordance with GAAP. 32 Table of Contents Alphabet Inc.

The foreign exchange impact was due to the U.S. dollar weakening relative to the Euro and Russian ruble, partially offset by the impact of the U.S. dollar strengthening relative to the British pound and Turkish lira. Our EMEA revenues from 2015 to 2016 were unfavorably impacted, primarily as a result of an unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates, offset by a favorable impact from hedging benefits. The foreign exchange impact was due to the U.S. dollar strengthening relative to the British pound, Euro, and Russian ruble. Our revenues from APAC from 2016 to 2017 were relatively flat, primarily as a result of a favorable impact from hedging benefits, offset by an unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates. The foreign exchange impact 33 Table of Contents Alphabet Inc. was due to the U.S. dollar strengthening relative to the Japanese yen, partially offset by the impact of the U.S. dollar weakening relative to the Australian dollar, Indian rupee, South Korean won, and Taiwanese dollar. Our revenues from APAC from 2015 to 2016 were relatively flat, primarily as a result of slight favorable impacts from foreign currency exchange rates and hedging benefits. The foreign exchange impact was due to the U.S. dollar weakening relative to the Japanese yen, partially offset by the impact of the U.S. dollar strengthening relative to the Indian rupee and Australian dollar. Our revenues from Other Americas from 2016 to 2017  were favorably impacted, primarily as a result of a favorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates, slightly offset by an unfavorable impact from hedging losses. The foreign exchange impact was due to the U.S. dollar weakening relative to the Brazilian real and Canadian dollar, partially offset by the impact of the U.S. dollar strengthening relative to the Argentine peso. Our revenues from Other Americas from 2015 to 2016 were unfavorably impacted, primarily as a result of an unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates, slightly offset by a favorable impact from hedging benefits. The foreign exchange impact was due to the U.S. dollar strengthening relative to certain currencies including the Argentine peso, Canadian dollar, Brazilian real, and the Mexican peso. Costs and Expenses Cost of Revenues Cost of revenues consists of TAC which are paid to Google Network Members primarily for ads displayed on their properties and amounts paid to our distribution partners who make available our search access points and services. Our distribution partners include browser providers, mobile carriers, original equipment manufacturers, and software developers. The cost of revenues related to revenues generated from ads placed on Google Network Members' properties are significantly higher than the costs of revenues related to revenues generated from ads placed on Google properties because most of the advertiser revenues from ads served on Google Network Members' properties are paid as TAC to our Google Network Members. Additionally, other cost of revenues (which is the cost of revenues excluding TAC) includes the following:  Amortization of certain intangible assets;  Content acquisition costs primarily related to payments to content providers from whom we license video and other content for distribution on YouTube and Google Play (we pay fees to these content providers based on revenues generated or a flat fee);  Credit card and other transaction fees related to processing customer transactions;  Expenses associated with our data center and other operations (including bandwidth, compensation expenses (including SBC), depreciation, energy, and other equipment costs); and  Inventory related costs for hardware we sell. 34 Table of Contents Alphabet Inc. The following tables present our cost of revenues, including TAC (in millions): Year Ended December 31,   2015   2016   2017 TAC $ 14,343     $ 16,793     $ 21,672   Other cost of revenues 13,821     18,345     23,911   Total cost of revenues $ 28,164     $ 35,138     $ 45,583   Total cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues 37.6 %   38.9 %   41.1 %               Year Ended December 31,   2015   2016   2017 TAC to distribution partners $ 4,101     $ 5,894     $ 9,031   TAC to distribution partners as a percentage of Google properties revenues(1) (Google properties TAC rate) 7.8 %   9.2 %   11.6 %             TAC to Google Network Members $ 10,242     $ 10,899     $ 12,641   TAC to Google Network Members as a percentage of Google Network Members' properties revenues(1) (Network Members TAC rate) 68.1 %   69.9 %   71.9 %             TAC $ 14,343     $ 16,793     $ 21,672   TAC as a percentage of advertising revenues(1) (Aggregate TAC rate) 21.3 %   21.2 %   22.7 % (1) Revenues include hedging gains(losses) which impact TAC rates. Cost of revenues increased $10,445 million from 2016 to 2017. The increase was due to an increase in TAC of $4,879 million. The increase in TAC to distribution partners was a result of an increase in Google properties revenues and the associated TAC rate. The increase in TAC to Google Network Members was a result of an increase in Google Network Members' properties revenues and the associated TAC rate. The increase in the Google properties TAC rate was driven by changes in partner agreements and the ongoing shift to mobile, which carries higher TAC because more mobile searches are channeled through paid access points. The increase in the Network Members TAC rate was driven by the continued underlying shift in advertising buying from our traditional network business to programmatic advertising buying. The increase in the aggregate TAC rate was also partially offset by a favorable revenue mix shift from Google Network Members' properties to Google properties. Other cost of revenues increased $5,566 million from 2016 to 2017. The increase was due to various factors, including an increase in data center and other operations costs, which include depreciation, compensation expenses (including SBC), energy, bandwidth, and other equipment costs as a result of business growth; hardware costs associated with new hardware launches; and content acquisition costs as a result of increased activities related to YouTube. Cost of revenues increased $6,974 million from 2015 to 2016 due to various factors including traffic acquisition costs, data center costs, content acquisition costs, and hardware costs. The increase in traffic acquisition costs of $2,450 million was due to increases in advertising revenues primarily from the growth of mobile search and programmatic ad buying which carry higher TAC. The increase in other cost of revenues of $4,524 million was primarily due to increases in (1) data center costs including depreciation, labor, energy, bandwidth, and other equipment costs as a result of business growth, (2) content acquisition costs as a result of increased activities related to YouTube, (3) hardware costs associated with new hardware launches, and (4) stock-based compensation. The aggregate TAC rate remained relatively flat from 2015 to 2016 primarily as a result of a shift of mix from Google Network Members' properties revenue to Google properties revenue. Our aggregate TAC rate was also impacted by the increase in mobile and programmatic advertising buying, which generally carry overall higher TAC. The increase in Google properties TAC rate was primarily driven by a shift to mobile and more mobile searches are subject to TAC. The increase in Network Members' TAC rate was primarily driven by the shift in advertising buying from our traditional network business to programmatic advertising buying. 35 Table of Contents Alphabet Inc. We expect cost of revenues to increase in dollar amount and as a percentage of total revenues in future periods based on a number of factors, including the following:  Google Network Members TAC rates, which are affected by the continued underlying shift in advertising buying from our traditional network business to programmatic advertising buying which carries higher TAC;  Google properties TAC rates, which are affected by changes in device mix between mobile, desktop, and tablet, partner mix, partner agreement terms such as revenue share arrangements, and the percentage of queries channeled through paid access points;  Growth rates of expenses associated with our data center and other operations, content acquisition costs, as well as our hardware inventory and related costs;  Increased proportion of non-advertising revenues, whose costs are generally higher in relation to our advertising revenues;  Relative revenue growth rates of Google properties and our Google Network Members' properties. Research and Development The following table presents our R&D expenses (in millions): Year Ended December 31,   2015   2016   2017 Research and development expenses $ 12,282     $ 13,948     $ 16,625   Research and development expenses as a percentage of revenues 16.4 %   15.5 %   15.0 % R&D expenses consist primarily of:  Compensation expenses, including SBC, and facilities-related costs for employees responsible for R&D of our existing and new products and services; and  Depreciation and equipment-related expenses. R&D expenses increased $2,677 million from 2016 to 2017. The increase was primarily due to an increase in compensation expenses, including SBC, and facilities-related costs of $1,886 million, largely resulting from a 16% increase in headcount. In addition, there was an increase in depreciation and equipment-related expenses of $569 million. R&D expenses increased $1,666 million from 2015 to 2016. The increase was primarily due to an increase in stock-based compensation expense of $667 million and an increase in labor and facilities-related costs of $326 million, both largely as a result of a 16% increase in R&D headcount, partially offset by higher expenses resulting from project milestones in Other Bets in 2015. In addition, there was an increase in depreciation and equipment-related expenses of approximately $388 million and an increase in professional services of $267 million due to additional expenses incurred for consulting, outsourced services, and temporary services. We expect that R&D expenses will increase in dollar amount and may fluctuate as a percentage of revenues in future periods. Sales and Marketing The following table presents our sales and marketing expenses (in millions): Year Ended December 31,   2015   2016   2017 Sales and marketing expenses $ 9,047     $ 10,485     $ 12,893   Sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenues 12.1 %   11.6 %   11.6 % Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of:  Advertising and promotional expenditures related to our products and services; and  Compensation expenses, including SBC, and facilities-related costs for employees engaged in sales and marketing, sales support, and certain customer service functions. Sales and marketing expenses increased $2,408 million from 2016 to 2017. The increase was primarily due to an increase in advertising and promotional expenses of $1,266 million, largely resulting from increases in marketing and promotion-related expenses for our hardware products, Cloud offerings, and YouTube. In addition, there was an increase in compensation expenses, including SBC, and facilities-related costs of $853 million, largely resulting from a 6% increase in headcount. 36 Table of Contents Alphabet Inc. Sales and marketing expenses increased $1,438 million from 2015 to 2016. The increase was primarily due to an increase in advertising and promotional expenses of $679 million, largely due to increases in marketing and promotion-related expenses for our hardware products. Additionally, there was an increase in labor and facilities-related costs of $482 million, and stock-based compensation expense of $179 million, both largely resulting from a 10% increase in sales and marketing headcount. We expect that sales and marketing expenses will increase in dollar amount and may fluctuate as a percentage of revenues in future periods. General and Administrative The following table presents our general and administrative expenses (in millions): Year Ended December 31,   2015   2016   2017 General and administrative expenses $ 6,136     $ 6,985     $ 6,872   General and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues 8.2 %   7.7 %   6.2 % General and administrative expenses consist primarily of:  Amortization of certain intangible assets;  Compensation expenses, including SBC, and facilities-related costs for employees in our facilities, finance, human resources, information technology, and legal organizations;  Depreciation and equipment-related expenses; and  Professional services fees primarily related to audit, information technology consulting, outside legal, and outsourcing services. General and administrative expenses decreased $113 million from 2016 to 2017. The decrease was primarily  from reduced allocations to general and administrative expenses with an offsetting increase to costs of revenues and other operating expenses. The decrease was partially offset by an increase in compensation expenses, including SBC, and facilities-related costs of $271 million, largely resulting from a 9% increase in headcount. Additionally, there was an increase in professional service fees of $253 million due to additional expenses incurred for outsourced services and consulting services. General and administrative expenses increased $849 million from 2015 to 2016. The increase was primarily due to increases in labor and facilities-related costs of $460 million, and stock-based compensation expense of $421 million, both largely resulting from a 15% increase in general and administrative headcount, as well as increases in other miscellaneous expenses. These increases were offset by a decrease in professional service fees of $194 million due to lower legal-related costs. We expect general and administrative expenses will increase in dollar amount and may fluctuate as a percentage of revenues in future periods. European Commission Fine In June 2017, the EC announced its decision that certain actions taken by Google regarding its display and ranking of shopping search results and ads infringed European competition law. The EC decision imposed a 2.42 billion (approximately $2.74 billion as of June 27, 2017) fine, which was accrued in the second quarter of 2017. Other Income (Expense), Net The following table presents other income (expense), net, (in millions): Year Ended December 31,   2015   2016   2017 Other income (expense), net $ 291     $ 434     $ 1,047   Other income (expense), net, as a percentage of revenues 0.4 %   0.5 %   0.9 % Other income (expense), net, increased $613 million from 2016 to 2017. This increase was primarily driven by  reduced costs of our foreign currency hedging activities, decreased losses on marketable securities and an increase in interest income. 37 Table of Contents Alphabet Inc. Other income (expense), net, increased $143 million from 2015 to 2016. This increase was primarily driven by an increase in interest income and decreased losses on non-marketable investments, partially offset by increased losses from our foreign currency transactions and impairments for certain assets. The costs of our foreign exchange hedging activities recognized in other income (expense), net, are primarily a function of the notional amount of the option and forward contracts and their related duration, the movement of foreign exchange rates relative to the contract prices, the volatility of foreign exchange rates and forward points. The hedging costs expensed in other income (expense), net, decreased as a result of less option premiums paid after we began to use foreign currency forward contracts to hedge our forecasted revenues in the fourth quarter of 2016. We expect that other income (expense), net, will fluctuate in dollar amount in future periods as it is largely driven by market dynamics. Provision for Income Taxes The following table presents our provision for income taxes (in millions) and effective tax rate: Year Ended December 31,   2015   2016   2017 Provision for income taxes $ 3,303     $ 4,672     $ 14,531   Effective tax rate 16.8 %   19.3 %   53.4 % Our provision for income taxes and our effective tax rate increased from 2016 to 2017, due to the Tax Act that was enacted in December 2017. Please refer to Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information. Our provision for income taxes and our effective tax rate increased from 2015 to 2016, largely due to  proportionately more earnings generated in jurisdictions that have higher statutory tax rates and discrete items in 2015 and 2016, partially offset by the stock-based compensation benefits recognized resulting from the adoption of Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-09 (ASU 2016-09). Our future effective tax rate will be affected by the Tax Act. Effective in 2018, the Tax Act reduces the U.S. statutory tax rate from 35% to 21% and creates new taxes on certain foreign-sourced earnings and certain related-party payments, which are referred to as the global intangible low-taxed income tax and the base erosion tax, respectively. Our future effective tax rate could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries that have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries that have higher statutory rates, the net gains and losses recognized by legal entities on certain hedges and related hedged intercompany and other transactions under our foreign exchange risk management program, changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets or liabilities, or changes in tax laws, regulations, or accounting principles, as well as certain discrete items. Quarterly Results of Operations The following tables presenting our quarterly results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We have prepared the unaudited information on the same basis as our audited consolidated financial statements. Our operating results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of results for any future quarters or for a full year. The following table presents our unaudited quarterly results of operations for the eight quarters ended December 31, 2017. This table includes all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, that we consider necessary for a fair presentation of our consolidated financial position and operating results for the quarters presented. Both seasonal fluctuations in internet usage, advertising expenditures and underlying business trends such as traditional retail seasonality have affected, and are likely to continue to affect, our business.

Cash equivalents and marketable securities are comprised of time deposits, money market and other funds, highly liquid debt instruments of the U.S. government and its agencies, debt instruments issued by foreign governments, debt instruments issued by municipalities in the U.S., corporate debt securities, mortgage-backed securities, and asset-backed securities. From time to time, we may hold marketable equity securities obtained through acquisitions or strategic investments in private companies that subsequently go public. On December 22, 2017, the Tax Act was enacted and we recorded a tax liability for the one-time transition tax on accumulated foreign subsidiary earnings of $10.2 billion, of which $890 million and $9.3 billion were presented within ""income tax payable, current"" and ""income tax payable, non-current,"" respectively, on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2017. As permitted by the Tax Act, we intend to pay the one-time transition tax in eight annual interest-free installments beginning in 2018. Our principal sources of liquidity are our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, as well as the cash flow that we generate from our operations. We have a short-term debt financing program of up to $5.0 billion through the issuance of commercial paper. Net proceeds from this program are used for general corporate purposes. We had no commercial paper outstanding as of December 31, 2017. We have a $4.0 billion revolving credit facility expiring in February 2021. The interest rate for the credit facility is determined based on a formula using certain market rates. As of December 31, 2017, no amounts were outstanding under the credit facility. We believe that our sources of funding will be sufficient to satisfy our currently anticipated cash requirements including capital expenditures, working capital requirements, potential acquisitions and other liquidity requirements through at least the next 12 months. As of December 31, 2017, we have senior unsecured notes outstanding due in 2021, 2024, and 2026 with a total carrying value of $3.9 billion and a total estimated fair value of $4.0 billion. In October 2016, the Board of Directors of Alphabet authorized the repurchase of up to $7.0 billion of Alphabet Class C capital stock. In 2017, we repurchased and subsequently retired 5.2 million shares of Alphabet Class C capital stock for an aggregate amount of $4.8 billion. In January 2018, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to an additional $8.6 billion of Alphabet Class C capital stock. The repurchases are expected to be executed from time to time, subject to general business and market conditions and other investment opportunities, through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions, including through Rule 10b5-1 plans. 39 Table of Contents Alphabet Inc. In January 2017, Temasek, a Singapore-based investment company, signed a binding commitment to purchase a non-controlling interest in Verily for an aggregate of $800 million in cash. We received the first tranche of $480 million in the first quarter of 2017 and the final tranche of $320 million in the third quarter of 2017. The following table presents our cash flows (in millions): Year Ended December 31,   2015   2016   2017 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 26,572     $ 36,036     $ 37,091   Net cash used in investing activities $ (23,711 )   $ (31,165 )   $ (31,401 ) Net cash used in financing activities $ (4,225 )   $ (8,332 )   $ (8,298 ) Cash Provided by Operating Activities Our largest source of cash provided by our operations are advertising revenues generated by Google properties and Google Network Members' properties. Additionally, we generate cash through sales of apps, in-app purchases, digital content products, and hardware; and licensing and service fees including fees received for Google Cloud offerings. Our primary uses of cash from our operating activities include payments to our Google Network Members and distribution partners, and payments for content acquisition costs. In addition, uses of cash from operating activities include compensation and related costs, hardware costs, other general corporate expenditures, and income taxes. Net cash provided by operating activities increased from 2016 to 2017 primarily due to increases in cash received from advertising revenues and Google other revenues (net of payouts to app developers), offset by increases in cash paid for cost of revenues, operating expenses, and income taxes. Net cash provided by operating activities increased from 2015 to 2016 primarily due to increases in cash received from advertising revenues and Google other revenues, offset by increases in cash paid for cost of revenues and operating expenses.  Additionally, the timing of tax payments and refunds had a favorable impact to our cash flows from operations for 2016 compared to 2015. Cash Used in Investing Activities Cash provided by or used in investing activities primarily consists of purchases of property and equipment,  purchases, maturities, and sales of marketable securities in our investment portfolio, cash collateral received or returned from our securities lending program, payments for acquisitions, and the proceeds from the collection of notes receivable. Net cash used in investing activities increased slightly from 2016 to 2017 primarily due to increases in purchases of marketable securities and increases in purchases of property and equipment, offset by increases in the maturities and sales of marketable securities, decreases in cash collateral paid related to securities lending, and increase in proceeds received from collections of notes receivables. Net cash used in investing activities increased from 2015 to 2016 primarily due to increases in purchases of marketable securities, increases in cash collateral paid related to securities lending and increases in spend related to acquisitions, partially offset by increases in maturities and sales of marketable securities and decreases in purchases of non-marketable investments. Cash Used in Financing Activities Cash used in financing activities consists primarily of net proceeds or payments from issuance or repayments of debt, repurchases of capital stock, and net proceeds or payments from stock-based award activities. Net cash used in financing activities decreased slightly from 2016 to 2017 primarily driven by decreases in the net cash outflow from repayments and issuance of debt, offset by increases in the repurchases of capital stock. Net cash used in financing activities increased from 2015 to 2016 primarily driven by decreases in proceeds from issuance of debt, and increases in the repurchases of capital stock and net payments related to stock-based award activities, partially offset by a decrease in debt repayments. 40 Table of Contents Alphabet Inc.

(2) Represents non-cancelable contractual obligations primarily related to data center operations and build-outs; digital media content licensing arrangements; and purchases of inventory. The amounts included above represent the non-cancelable portion of agreements or the minimum cancellation fee. For those agreements with variable terms, we do not estimate the non-cancelable obligation beyond any minimum quantities and/or pricing as of December 31, 2017. Excluded from the table above are open orders for purchases that support normal operations. (3) Represents our principal and interest payments. For further information on long-term debt, refer to Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. (4) Represents one-time transition tax payable related to known amounts of cash taxes payable in future years as a result of the Tax Act. For further information, refer to Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Excluded from the table above are long-term taxes payable of $3.5 billion as of December 31, 2017 related to uncertain tax positions. At this time, we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments for uncertain tax positions in individual years beyond 12 months due to uncertainties in the timing of tax audit outcomes. (5) Represents cash obligations recorded on our consolidated balance sheets, including the short-term portion of these long-term liabilities, and consist primarily of facility build-outs and payments owed in connection with certain commercial agreements. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements As of December 31, 2017, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K, that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in our financial condition, revenues, or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources that is material to investors. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates We prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). In doing so, we have to make estimates and assumptions that affect our reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses, as well as related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. In some cases, we could reasonably have used different accounting policies and estimates. In some cases, changes in the accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period. Accordingly, actual results could differ materially from our estimates. To the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results, our financial condition or results of operations will be affected. We base our estimates on past experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, and we evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis. We refer to accounting estimates of this type as critical accounting policies and estimates, which we discuss further below. We have reviewed our critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors. Please see Note 1 of Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the summary of significant accounting policies. 41 Table of Contents Alphabet Inc. Revenues For the sale of third-party goods and services, we evaluate whether we are the principal, and report revenues on a gross basis, or an agent, and report revenues on a net basis. In this assessment, we consider if we obtain control of the specified goods or services before they are transferred to the customer, as well as other indicators such as the party primarily responsible for fulfillment, inventory risk, and discretion in establishing price. Income Taxes We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions, determining our provision for income taxes, and evaluating the impact of the Tax Act. The Tax Act was enacted on December 22, 2017 and introduces significant changes to U.S. income tax law. Effective in 2018, the Tax Act reduces the U.S. statutory tax rate from 35% to 21% and creates new taxes on certain foreign-sourced earnings and certain related-party payments, which are referred to as the global intangible low-taxed income tax and the base erosion tax, respectively. In addition, in 2017 we are subject to a one-time transition tax on accumulated foreign subsidiary earnings not previously subject to U.S. income tax. Accounting for the income tax effects of the Tax Act requires significant judgments and estimates in the interpretation and calculations of the provisions of the Tax Act. Due to the timing of the enactment and the complexity involved in applying the provisions of the Tax Act, we have made reasonable estimates of the effects and recorded provisional amounts in our financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2017. As we collect and prepare necessary data, and interpret any additional guidance issued by the U.S. Treasury Department, the IRS or other standard-setting bodies, we may make adjustments to the provisional amounts. Those adjustments may materially impact the provision for income taxes and the effective tax rate in the period in which the adjustments are made. The accounting for the tax effects of the enactment of the Tax Act will be completed in 2018. Although we believe we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences will impact the provision for income taxes and the effective tax rate in the period in which such determination is made. The provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate as well as the related net interest and penalties. In addition, we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the IRS and other tax authorities which may assert assessments against us. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations and assessments to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. Loss Contingencies We are regularly subject to claims, suits, government investigations, and other proceedings involving competition and antitrust, intellectual property, privacy, non-income taxes, labor and employment, commercial disputes, content generated by our users, goods and services offered by advertisers or publishers using our platforms, and other matters. Certain of these matters include speculative claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts of damages. We record a liability when we believe that it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If we determine that a loss is reasonably possible and the loss or range of loss can be estimated, we disclose the possible loss in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We evaluate, on a regular basis, developments in our legal matters that could affect the amount of liability that has been previously accrued, and the matters and related reasonably possible losses disclosed, and make adjustments and changes to our disclosures as appropriate. Significant judgment is required to determine both the likelihood of there being, and the estimated amount of, a loss related to such matters. Until the final resolution of such matters, there may be an exposure to loss in excess of the amount recorded, and such amounts could be material. Should any of our estimates and assumptions change or prove to have been incorrect, it could have a material impact on our business, consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. See Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding contingencies. Business Combinations We allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values. The excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. When determining the fair values 42 Table of Contents Alphabet Inc. of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, management makes significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets. Critical estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include but are not limited to future expected cash flows (primarily from customer relationships and acquired patents and developed technology) and discount rates. Management's estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from estimates. Other estimates associated with the accounting for acquisitions may change as additional information becomes available regarding the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, as more fully discussed in Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Goodwill Goodwill is allocated to reporting units expected to benefit from the business combination. We evaluate our reporting units when changes in our operating structure occur, and if necessary, reassign goodwill using a relative fair value allocation approach. We test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level at least annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired. Goodwill impairment tests require judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units, assignment of goodwill to reporting units, and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit. Long-lived Assets Long-lived assets, including property and equipment, long-term prepayments, and intangible assets, excluding goodwill, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. The evaluation is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows independent of other assets. An impairment loss would be recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash flows generated from the assets are less than their carrying amount. Measurement of an impairment loss would be based on the excess of the carrying amount of the asset group over its fair value. Impairment of Securities We periodically review our securities for impairment. If we conclude that any of these investments are impaired, we determine whether such impairment is other-than-temporary. Factors we consider to make such determination include the duration and severity of the impairment, the reason for the decline in value and the potential recovery period and our intent to sell. For marketable debt securities, we also consider whether (1) it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis, and (2) the amortized cost basis cannot be recovered as a result of credit losses. If any impairment is considered other-than-temporary, we will write down the asset to its fair value and record the corresponding charge as other income (expense), net.","ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We are exposed to financial market risks, including changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. Foreign Currency Exchange Risk We transact business globally in multiple currencies. Our international revenues, as well as costs and expenses denominated in foreign currencies, expose us to the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar. In general, we are a net receiver of foreign currencies and therefore benefit from a weakening of the U.S. dollar and are adversely affected by a strengthening of the U.S. dollar. Principal currencies hedged included the Australian dollar, British pound, Canadian dollar, Euro and Japanese yen. We use foreign currency forwards and option contracts, including collars (an option strategy comprised of a combination of purchased and written options) to protect our forecasted U.S. dollar-equivalent earnings from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. When the U.S. dollar strengthens, gains from foreign currency options and forwards reduce the foreign currency losses related to our earnings. When the U.S. dollar weakens, losses from foreign currency collars and forwards offset the foreign currency gains related to our earnings. These hedging contracts reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements. We designate these contracts as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes. We record the effective portion of these contracts as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) and subsequently reclassify them into revenues to offset the hedged exposures as they occur. For foreign currency collars, we include the change in time value in our assessment of hedge effectiveness. For forwards and all other option contracts, we exclude the change in the forward points and time value 43 Table of Contents Alphabet Inc. from our assessment of hedge effectiveness. We recognize changes of the excluded components in other income (expense), net. We considered the historical trends in foreign currency exchange rates and determined that it was reasonably possible that changes in exchange rates of 10% could be experienced in the near term. If the U.S. dollar weakened by 10% as of December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2017, the amount recorded in AOCI related to our foreign exchange contracts before tax effect would have been approximately $920 million and $950 million lower as of December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2017, respectively. The change in the value recorded in AOCI would be expected to offset a corresponding foreign currency change in forecasted hedged revenues when recognized. In addition, we use foreign exchange forward contracts to offset the foreign exchange risk on our assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the local currency of the subsidiary.  These forward contracts reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on our assets and liabilities. The foreign currency gains and losses on the assets and liabilities are recorded in other income (expense), net, which are offset by the gains and losses on the forward contracts. We considered the historical trends in foreign currency exchange rates and determined that it was reasonably possible that adverse changes in exchange rates of 10% for all currencies could be experienced in the near term. These reasonably possible adverse changes in exchange rates of 10% were applied to total monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the local currencies at the balance sheet dates to compute the adverse impact these changes would have had on our income before income taxes in the near term. These changes would have resulted in an adverse impact on income before income taxes of approximately $40 million and $52 million as of December 31, 2016 and 2017, respectively. The adverse impact as of December 31, 2016 and 2017 is after consideration of the offsetting effect of approximately $554 million and $374 million, respectively, from foreign exchange contracts in place for the months ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2017. Interest Rate Risk Our investment strategy is to achieve a return that will allow us to preserve capital and maintain liquidity requirements. We invest primarily in debt securities including those of the U.S. government and its agencies, corporate debt securities, mortgage-backed securities, money market and other funds, municipal securities, time deposits, asset backed securities, and debt instruments issued by foreign governments. By policy, we limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. Our investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning securities carry a degree of interest rate risk. Fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income than predicted if interest rates fall. Unrealized  gains or losses on our marketable debt securities are primarily due to interest rate fluctuations as a result of higher market interest rates compared to interest rates at the time of purchase. We account for both fixed and variable rate securities at fair value with changes on gains and losses recorded in AOCI until the securities are sold. To enhance our assessment of the interest rate risk associated with our investment portfolio, we use value-at-risk (VaR) analysis to determine the potential impact of fluctuations in interest rates on the value of our marketable debt security portfolio. The VaR is the expected loss in fair value, for a given confidence interval, for our investment portfolio due to adverse movements in interest rates. We use a variance/covariance VaR model with 95% confidence interval. The estimated one-day loss in fair value of our marketable debt securities as of December 31, 2016 and 2017 are shown below (in millions): As of December 31,   12-Month Average  As of December 31,   2016   2017   2016   2017 Risk Category - Interest Rate $ 107     $ 84     $ 99     $ 87 Actual future gains and losses associated with our marketable debt security portfolio may differ materially from the sensitivity analyses performed as of December 31, 2016 and 2017 due to the inherent limitations associated with predicting the timing and amount of changes in interest rates and our actual exposures and positions. VaR analysis is not intended to represent actual losses but is used as a risk estimation. 44 Table of Contents Alphabet Inc.","ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA Alphabet Inc.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of the Company at December 31, 2016 and 2017, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2017, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report February 5, 2018 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. /s/ Ernst & Young LLP       We have served as the Company's auditor since 1999.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2016 and 2017, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2017, and the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a)2, of the Company and our report dated February 5, 2018 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. Basis for Opinion The Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Definition and Limitation of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/ Ernst & Young LLP       San Jose, California   February 5, 2018 47 Table of Contents Alphabet Inc.

Alphabet Inc. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Note 1.    Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Nature of Operations Google was incorporated in California in September 1998 and re-incorporated in the State of Delaware in August 2003. In 2015, we implemented a holding company reorganization, and as a result, Alphabet Inc. (Alphabet) became the successor issuer to Google. We generate revenues primarily by delivering relevant, cost-effective online advertising. Basis of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements of Alphabet include the accounts of Alphabet and entities consolidated under the variable interest and voting models. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. Use of Estimates Preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP) requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported and disclosed in the financial statements and the accompanying notes. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to the accounts receivable and sales allowances, fair values of financial instruments, intangible assets and goodwill, useful lives of intangible assets and property and equipment, income taxes, and contingent liabilities, among others. We base our estimates on assumptions, both historical and forward looking, that are believed to be reasonable, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Revenue Recognition We recognize revenues when we transfer control of promised goods or services to our customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. See Note 2 for further discussion on Revenues. Cost of Revenues Cost of revenues consists of TAC and other costs of revenues. TAC represents the amounts paid to Google Network Members primarily for ads displayed on their properties and amounts paid to our distribution partners who make available our search access points and services. Our distribution partners include browser providers, mobile carriers, original equipment manufacturers, and software developers. Other costs of revenues (which is the cost of revenues excluding TAC) include the following:  Amortization of certain intangible assets;  Content acquisition costs primarily related to payments to content providers from whom we license video and other content for distribution on YouTube and Google Play (we pay fees to these content providers based on revenues generated or a flat fee);  Credit card and other transaction fees related to processing customer transactions;  Expenses associated with our data centers and other operations (including bandwidth, compensation expense (including SBC), depreciation, energy, and other equipment costs); and  Inventory related costs for hardware we sell. Stock-based Compensation Stock-based compensation primarily consists of Alphabet restricted stock units (RSUs). RSUs are equity classified and measured at the fair market value of the underlying stock at the grant date. We recognize RSU expense using the straight-line attribution method over the requisite service period and account for forfeitures as they occur. For RSUs, shares are issued on the vesting dates net of the applicable statutory tax withholding to be paid by us on behalf of our employees. As a result, fewer shares are issued than the number of RSUs outstanding. We record a liability for the tax withholding to be paid by us as a reduction to additional paid-in capital. Additionally, stock-based compensation includes other types of stock-based awards that may be settled in the stock of our subsidiaries or in cash. Certain awards are liability classified and are remeasured at fair value through settlement. Performance Fees We have compensation arrangements with payouts based on investment returns. We recognize compensation expense based on the estimated payouts. The amounts are recorded in general and administrative expenses and were not material for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2016, and 2017. Certain Risks and Concentrations Our revenues are primarily derived from online advertising, the market for which is highly competitive and rapidly changing. In addition, our revenues are generated from a multitude of vertical market segments in countries around the world. Significant changes in this industry or changes in customer buying or advertiser spending behavior could adversely affect our operating results. We are subject to concentrations of credit risk principally from cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, foreign exchange contracts, and accounts receivable. Cash equivalents and marketable securities consist primarily of time deposits, money market and other funds, highly liquid debt instruments of the U.S. government and its agencies, debt instruments issued by foreign governments, debt instruments issued by municipalities in the U.S., corporate debt securities, mortgage-backed securities, and asset-backed securities. Foreign exchange contracts are transacted with various financial institutions with high credit standing. Accounts receivable are typically unsecured and are derived from revenues earned from customers located around the world. We perform ongoing evaluations to determine customer credit and we limit the amount of credit we extend. We generally do not require collateral from our customers. We maintain reserves for estimated credit losses and these losses have generally been within our expectations. No individual customer or groups of affiliated customers represented more than 10% of our revenues in 2015, 2016, or 2017. In 2015, 2016, and 2017, we generated approximately 46%, 47%, and 47% of our revenues, respectively, from customers based in the U.S. See Note 2 for further details. Fair Value of Financial Instruments Our financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis include cash equivalents, marketable securities, derivative contracts, and non-marketable debt securities. Our financial assets that are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis when impairment is identified or assets are held for sale include long-lived assets and non-marketable equity securities. Other financial assets and liabilities are carried at cost with fair value disclosed, if required. Fair value is an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. As such, fair value is a market-based measurement that is determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or a liability. Assets and liabilities recorded at fair value are measured and classified in accordance with a three-tier fair value hierarchy based on the observability of the inputs available in the market used to measure fair value: Level 1 - Observable inputs that reflect quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets. Level 2 - Include other inputs that are based upon quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, and model-based valuation techniques for which all significant inputs are observable in the market or can be derived from observable market data. Where applicable, these models project future cash flows and discount the future amounts to a present value using market-based observable inputs including interest rate curves, foreign exchange rates, and credit ratings. Level 3 - Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activities. The fair value hierarchy requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Marketable Securities We invest all excess cash primarily in debt securities including those of the U.S. government and its agencies, corporate debt securities, mortgage-backed securities, money market and other funds, municipal securities, time deposits, asset backed securities, and debt instruments issued by foreign governments. 53 Table of Contents Alphabet Inc. We classify all investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and have stated maturities of three months or less from the date of purchase as cash equivalents and those with stated maturities of greater than three months as marketable securities. We determine the appropriate classification of our investments in marketable securities at the time of purchase and reevaluate such designation at each balance sheet date. We have classified and accounted for our marketable securities as available-for-sale. After consideration of our risk versus reward objectives, as well as our liquidity requirements, we may sell these securities prior to their stated maturities. As we view these securities as available to support current operations, we classify highly liquid securities with maturities beyond 12 months as current assets under the caption marketable securities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. We carry these securities at fair value, and report the unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, as a component of stockholders' equity, except for unrealized losses determined to be other-than-temporary, which we record within other income (expense), net. We determine any realized gains or losses on the sale of marketable securities on a specific identification method, and we record such gains and losses as a component of other income (expense), net. Non-Marketable Investments We account for non-marketable equity investments either under the equity or cost method. Investments through which we exercise significant influence but do not have control over the investee are accounted for under the equity method. Investments through which we are not able to exercise significant influence over the investee are accounted for under the cost method. We classify non-marketable investments as non-current assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as those investments do not have stated contractual maturity dates. We account for our non-marketable investments that meet the definition of a debt security as available-for-sale securities. Variable Interest Entities We determine at the inception of each arrangement whether an entity in which we have made an investment or in which we have other variable interests in is considered a Variable Interest Entity (VIE). We consolidate VIEs when we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary. The primary beneficiary of a VIE is the party that meets both of the following criteria: (1) has the power to make decisions that most significantly affect the economic performance of the VIE; and (2) has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that in either case could potentially be significant to the VIE. Periodically, we determine whether any changes in our interest or relationship with the entity impact our determination of whether the entity is still a VIE and, if so, whether we are the primary beneficiary. If we are not deemed to be the primary beneficiary in a VIE, we account for the investment or other variable interests in a VIE in accordance with applicable GAAP. Impairment of Investments We periodically review our investments for impairment. If we conclude that any of these investments are impaired, we determine whether such impairment is other-than-temporary. Factors we consider to make such determination include the duration and severity of the impairment, the reason for the decline in value and the potential recovery period and our intent to sell. For debt securities, we also consider whether (1) it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis, and (2) the amortized cost basis cannot be recovered as a result of credit losses. If any impairment is considered other-than-temporary, we will write down the asset to its fair value and record the corresponding charge as other income (expense), net. Accounts Receivable We record accounts receivable at the invoiced amount. We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts to reserve for potentially uncollectible receivables. We review the accounts receivable by amounts due by customers which are past due to identify specific customers with known disputes or collectability issues. In determining the amount of the reserve, we make judgments about the creditworthiness of significant customers based on ongoing credit evaluations. We also maintain a sales allowance to reserve for potential credits issued to customers. We determine the amount of the reserve based on historical credits issued. Property and Equipment We account for property and equipment at cost less accumulated depreciation. We compute depreciation using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. We depreciate buildings over periods up to 25 years. We generally depreciate information technology assets over periods up to 7 years. We depreciate leasehold improvements over the shorter of the remaining lease term or the estimated useful lives of the assets. Construction in progress is the construction or development of property and equipment that have not yet been placed in service for 54 Table of Contents Alphabet Inc. our intended use. Depreciation for equipment, buildings, and leasehold improvements commences once they are ready for our intended use. Land is not depreciated. Inventory Inventory consists primarily of finished goods and is stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value.  Cost is computed using the first-in, first-out method. Software Development Costs We expense software development costs, including costs to develop software products or the software component of products to be sold, leased, or marketed to external users, before technological feasibility is reached. Technological feasibility is typically reached shortly before the release of such products and as a result, development costs that meet the criteria for capitalization were not material for the periods presented. Software development costs also include costs to develop software to be used solely to meet internal needs and cloud based applications used to deliver our services. We capitalize development costs related to these software applications once the preliminary project stage is complete and it is probable that the project will be completed and the software will be used to perform the function intended. Costs capitalized for developing such software applications were not material for the periods presented. Business Combinations We include the results of operations of the businesses that we acquire as of the acquisition date. We allocate the purchase price of our acquisitions to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values. The excess of the purchase price over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. Acquisition-related expenses are recognized separately from the business combination and are expensed as incurred. Long-Lived Assets, Goodwill and Other Acquired Intangible Assets We review property and equipment, long-term prepayments and intangible assets, excluding goodwill, for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable. We measure recoverability of these assets by comparing the carrying amounts to the future undiscounted cash flows that the assets or the asset group are expected to generate. If the carrying value of the assets are not recoverable, the impairment recognized is measured as the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value. Intangible asset impairments were not material in 2015, 2016, or 2017. We allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the expected benefit from the business combination. We evaluate our reporting units when changes in our operating structure occur, and if necessary, reassign goodwill using a relative fair value allocation approach. We test our goodwill for impairment at least annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired. No goodwill impairment occurred in 2015, 2016, or 2017. Intangible assets with definite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives. We amortize intangible assets on a straight-line basis with definite lives over periods ranging from one to twelve years. Income Taxes We account for income taxes using the asset and liability method, under which we recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. We measure current and deferred tax assets and liabilities based on provisions of enacted tax law. We evaluate the realization of our deferred tax assets based on all available evidence and establish a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that they will not be realized. We recognize the financial statement effects of a tax position when it is more likely than not that, based on technical merits, the position will be sustained upon examination. The tax benefits of the position recognized in the financial statements are then measured based on the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely to be realized upon settlement with a taxing authority. In addition, we recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of the income tax provision. Foreign Currency Generally, the functional currency of our international subsidiaries is the local currency. We translate the financial statements of these subsidiaries to U.S. dollars using month-end exchange rates for assets and liabilities, and average rates for the annual period derived from month-end exchange rates for revenues, costs, and expenses. We record 55 Table of Contents Alphabet Inc. translation gains and losses in accumulated other comprehensive income as a component of stockholders' equity. We reflect net foreign exchange transaction gains and losses resulting from the conversion of the transaction currency to functional currency as a component of foreign currency exchange losses in other income (expense), net. Advertising and Promotional Expenses We expense advertising and promotional costs in the period in which they are incurred. For the years ended December 31, 2015, 2016 and 2017, advertising and promotional expenses totaled approximately $3.2 billion, $3.9 billion, and $5.1 billion, respectively. Recent Accounting Pronouncements Recently issued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted In January 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-01 (ASU 2016-01) ""Financial Instruments-Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities."" ASU 2016-01 amends various aspects of the recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of financial instruments. The most significant impact to our consolidated financial statements relates to the recognition and measurement of equity investments at fair value in our consolidated statements of income. We have elected to use the measurement alternative, defined as cost, less impairments, adjusted by observable price changes. We anticipate that the adoption of ASU 2016-01 will increase the volatility of our other income (expense), net, as a result of the remeasurement of our equity securities upon the occurrence of observable price changes and impairments. We will adopt ASU 2016-01 effective January 1, 2018. In February 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-02 (Topic 842) ""Leases."" Topic 842 supersedes the lease recognition requirements in Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 840, ""Leases."" Under Topic 842, lessees are required to recognize assets and liabilities on the balance sheet for most leases and provide enhanced disclosures. Leases will continue to be classified as either finance or operating. As currently issued, entities are required to use a modified retrospective approach for leases that exist or are entered into after the beginning of the earliest comparative period in the financial statements. There are additional optional practical expedients that an entity may elect to apply. We anticipate that the adoption of Topic 842 will materially affect our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We are in the process of implementing changes to our systems and processes in conjunction with our review of existing lease agreements. We will adopt Topic 842 effective January 1, 2019 and expect to elect certain available transitional practical expedients. In June 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-13 (ASU 2016-13) ""Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments"" which requires the measurement and recognition of expected credit losses for financial assets held at amortized cost. ASU 2016-13 replaces the existing incurred loss impairment model with an expected loss methodology, which will result in more timely recognition of credit losses. ASU 2016-13 is effective for annual reporting periods, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2019. We are currently in the process of evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2016-13 on our consolidated financial statements. In October 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-16 (ASU 2016-16) ""Income Taxes (Topic 740): Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other than Inventory."" ASU 2016-16 generally accelerates the recognition of income tax consequences for asset transfers between entities under common control. Entities are required to adopt using a modified retrospective approach with a cumulative adjustment to opening retained earnings in the year of adoption for previously unrecognized income tax expense. We anticipate a retained earnings adjustment of approximately $700 million upon adoption related to the unrecognized income tax effects of asset transfers that occurred prior to adoption. We will adopt ASU 2016-16 effective January 1, 2018. In January 2017, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2017-04 (ASU 2017-04) ""Intangibles-Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment."" ASU 2017-04 eliminates step two of the goodwill impairment test and specifies that goodwill impairment should be measured by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. Additionally, the amount of goodwill allocated to each reporting unit with a zero or negative carrying amount of net assets should be disclosed. ASU 2017-04 is effective for annual or interim goodwill impairment tests performed in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019; early adoption is permitted. We currently do not anticipate that the adoption of ASU 2017-04 will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. Recently adopted accounting pronouncements In May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09 (Topic 606) ""Revenue from Contracts with Customers."" Topic 606 supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in Topic 605 ""Revenue 56 Table of Contents Alphabet Inc. Recognition"" (Topic 605), and requires entities to recognize revenues when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to customers at an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. We adopted Topic 606 as of January 1, 2017 using the modified retrospective transition method. See Note 2 for further details. In January 2017, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2017-01 (ASU 2017-01) ""Business Combinations (Topic 805): Clarifying the Definition of a Business."" ASU 2017-01 provides guidance to evaluate whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions (or disposals) of assets or businesses. If substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired (or disposed of) is concentrated in a single asset or a group of similar assets, the assets acquired (or disposed of) are not considered a business. We adopted ASU 2017-01 as of January 1, 2017 on a prospective basis and there was no material impact to our consolidated financial statements. Prior Period Reclassifications Certain amounts in prior periods have been reclassified to conform with current period presentation. Note 2.    Revenues Adoption of ASC Topic 606, ""Revenue from Contracts with Customers"" On January 1, 2017, we adopted Topic 606 using the modified retrospective method applied to those contracts which were not completed as of January 1, 2017. Results for reporting periods beginning after January 1, 2017 are presented under Topic 606, while prior period amounts are not adjusted and continue to be reported in accordance with our historic accounting under Topic 605. We recorded a net reduction to opening retained earnings of $15 million, net of tax, as of January 1, 2017 due to the cumulative impact of adopting Topic 606, with the impact primarily related to our non-advertising revenues. The impact to revenues as a result of applying Topic 606 was an increase of $34 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017. Revenue Recognition Revenues are recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to our customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. The following table presents our revenues disaggregated by revenue source (in millions). Sales and usage-based taxes are excluded from revenues. Twelve Months Ended   December 31,   2015(1)   2016(1)   2017 Google properties $ 52,357     $ 63,785     $ 77,788   Google Network Members' properties 15,033     15,598     17,587   Google advertising revenues 67,390     79,383     95,375   Google other revenues 7,154     10,080     14,277   Other Bets revenues 445     809     1,203   Total revenues(2) $ 74,989     $ 90,272     $ 110,855 (1) As noted above, prior period amounts have not been adjusted under the modified retrospective method. (2) Revenues include hedging gains (losses) of $1.4 billion, $539 million, and $(169) million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2016, and 2017, respectively, which do not represent revenues recognized from contracts with customers. 57 Table of Contents Alphabet Inc. The following table presents our revenues disaggregated by geography, based on the billing addresses of our customers (in millions): Twelve Months Ended   December 31,   2015   2016   2017 United States $ 34,810     $ 42,781     $ 52,449   EMEA(1) 26,368     30,304     36,046   APAC(1) 9,887     12,559     16,235   Other Americas(1) 3,924     4,628     6,125   Total revenues(2) $ 74,989     $ 90,272     $ 110,855 (1) Regions represent Europe, the Middle East, and Africa (EMEA); Asia-Pacific (APAC); and Canada and Latin America (Other Americas). (2) Revenues include hedging gains (losses) for the the years ended December 31, 2015, 2016, and 2017. Advertising Revenues We generate revenues primarily by delivering advertising on Google properties and Google Network Members' properties. Google properties revenues consist primarily of advertising revenues generated on Google.com, the Google Search app, and other Google owned and operated properties like Gmail, Google Maps, Google Play, and YouTube. Google Network Members' properties revenues consist primarily of advertising revenues generated on Google Network Members' properties. Our customers generally purchase advertising inventory through AdWords, DoubleClick AdExchange, and DoubleClick Bid Manager, among others. Most of our customers pay us on a cost-per-click basis (CPC), which means that an advertiser pays us only when a user clicks on an ad on Google properties or Google Network Members' properties or views certain YouTube engagement ads. For these customers, we recognize revenue each time a user clicks on the ad or when a user views the ad for a specified period of time. We also offer advertising on other bases such as cost-per-impression (CPM), which means an advertiser pays us based on the number of times their ads are displayed on Google properties or Google Network Members' properties. For these customers, we recognize revenue each time an ad is displayed. Certain customers may receive cash-based incentives or credits, which are accounted for as variable consideration. We estimate these amounts based on the expected amount to be provided to customers and reduce revenues recognized. We believe that there will not be significant changes to our estimates of variable consideration. For ads placed on Google Network Members' properties, we evaluate whether we are the principal (i.e., report revenues on a gross basis) or agent (i.e., report revenues on a net basis). Generally, we report advertising revenues for ads placed on Google Network Members' properties on a gross basis, that is, the amounts billed to our customers are recorded as revenues, and amounts paid to Google Network Members are recorded as cost of revenues. Where we are the principal, we control the advertising inventory before it is transferred to our customers. Our control is evidenced by our sole ability to monetize the advertising inventory before it is transferred to our customers, and is further supported by us being primarily responsible to our customers and having a level of discretion in establishing pricing. Other Revenues Google other revenues and Other Bets revenues consist primarily of revenues from:  Apps, in-app purchases, and digital content in the Google Play store;  Google Cloud offerings;  Hardware; and  Other miscellaneous products and services. As it relates to Google other revenues, the most significant judgment is determining whether we are the principal or agent for app sales and in-app purchases through the Google Play store. We report revenues from these transactions on a net basis because our performance obligation is to facilitate a transaction between app developers and end users, 58 Table of Contents Alphabet Inc. for which we earn a commission. Consequently, the portion of the gross amount billed to end users that is remitted to app developers is not reflected as revenues. Arrangements with Multiple Performance Obligations Our contracts with customers may include multiple performance obligations. For such arrangements, we allocate revenues to each performance obligation based on its relative standalone selling price. We generally determine standalone selling prices based on the prices charged to customers or using expected cost plus margin. Deferred Revenues We record deferred revenues when cash payments are received or due in advance of our performance, including amounts which are refundable. The increase in the deferred revenue balance for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 is primarily driven by cash payments received or due in advance of satisfying our performance obligations, offset by $985 million of revenues recognized that were included in the deferred revenue balance as of December 31, 2016. Our payment terms vary by the type and location of our customer and the products or services offered. The term between invoicing and when payment is due is not significant. For certain products or services and customer types, we require payment before the products or services are delivered to the customer. Practical Expedients and Exemptions We generally expense sales commissions when incurred because the amortization period would have been one year or less. These costs are recorded within sales and marketing expenses. We do not disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for (i) contracts with an original expected length of one year or less and (ii) contracts for which we recognize revenue at the amount to which we have the right to invoice for services performed. Note 3.    Financial Instruments We classify our cash equivalents and marketable securities within Level 1 or Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy because we use quoted market prices or alternative pricing sources and models utilizing market observable inputs to determine their fair value. We classify our foreign currency and interest rate derivative contracts primarily within Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy as the valuation inputs are based on quoted prices and market observable data of similar instruments. 59 Table of Contents Alphabet Inc.

We recognized gross realized losses of $565 million, $482 million, and $287 million 60 Table of Contents Alphabet Inc. for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2016, and 2017, respectively. We reflect these gains and losses as a component of other income (expense), net, in the Consolidated Statements of Income.

During the year ended December 31, 2015, we recognized $281 million of other-than-temporary impairment losses related to our marketable equity securities and fixed-income bond funds. Those losses are included in gain (loss) on marketable securities, net as a component of other income (expense), net, in the Consolidated Statements of Income. See Note 7 for further details on other income (expense), net. Derivative Financial Instruments We recognize derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value. We record changes in the fair value (i.e., gains or losses) of the derivatives in the Consolidated Statements of 61 Table of Contents Alphabet Inc. Income as either other income (expense), net, or revenues, or in the Consolidated Balance Sheets in accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI), as discussed below. We enter into foreign currency contracts with financial institutions to reduce the risk that our cash flows and earnings will be adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. We also use interest rate derivative contracts to hedge interest rate exposures on our fixed income securities and debt issuances. Our program is not used for trading or speculative purposes. We enter into master netting arrangements, which reduce credit risk by permitting net settlement of transactions with the same counterparty. To further reduce credit risk, we enter into collateral security arrangements under which the counterparty is required to provide collateral when the net fair value of certain financial instruments fluctuates from contractually established thresholds. We can take possession of the collateral in the event of counterparty default.  As of December 31, 2016 and 2017, we received cash collateral related to the derivative instruments under our collateral security arrangements of $362 million and $15 million, respectively. Cash Flow Hedges We use foreign currency forwards and option contracts, including collars (an option strategy comprised of a combination of purchased and written options), designated as cash flow hedges to hedge certain forecasted revenue transactions denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar and at times we use interest rate swaps to effectively lock interest rates on anticipated debt issuances. These transactions are designated as cash flow hedges. The notional principal of these contracts was approximately $10.7 billion and $11.7 billion as of December 31, 2016 and 2017, respectively. These contracts have maturities of 2 years or less. We reflect the gains or losses on the effective portion of a cash flow hedge as a component of AOCI and subsequently reclassify cumulative gains and losses to revenues or interest expense when the hedged transactions are recorded. If the hedged transactions become probable of not occurring, the corresponding amounts in AOCI are immediately reclassified to other income (expense), net. For foreign currency collars, we include the change in time value in our assessment of hedge effectiveness. For other foreign currency options and forward contracts, we exclude the change in the forward points and time value from our assessment of hedge effectiveness. We recognize changes of the excluded components in other income (expense), net. As of December 31, 2017, the effective portion of our cash flow hedges before tax effect was a net accumulated loss of $187 million, of which a net loss of $219 million is expected to be reclassified from AOCI into earnings within the next 12 months. Fair Value Hedges We use forward contracts designated as fair value hedges to hedge foreign currency risks for our investments denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. We exclude changes in forward points for forward contracts from the assessment of hedge effectiveness. The notional principal of these contracts was $2.4 billion and $2.9 billion as of December 31, 2016 and 2017, respectively. Gains and losses on these forward contracts are recognized in other income (expense), net, along with the offsetting gains and losses of the related hedged items. Other Derivatives Other derivatives not designated as hedging instruments consist of foreign currency forward contracts that we use to hedge intercompany transactions and other monetary assets or liabilities denominated in currencies other than the local currency of a subsidiary. We recognize gains and losses on these contracts, as well as the related costs in other income (expense), net, along with the foreign currency gains and losses on monetary assets and liabilities. The notional principal of the outstanding foreign exchange contracts was $7.9 billion and $15.2 billion as of December 31, 2016 and 2017, respectively. 62 Table of Contents Alphabet Inc.

Note 4.    Non-Marketable Investments Our non-marketable investments include non-marketable equity investments and non-marketable debt securities. Non-Marketable Equity Investments Our non-marketable equity investments are investments in privately-held companies accounted for under the equity or cost method and are not required to be consolidated under the variable interest or voting models. As of December 31, 2016 and 2017, investments accounted for under the equity method had a carrying value of approximately $1.7 billion and $1.4 billion, respectively. Our share of gains and losses in equity method investments including impairment was a net loss of $227 million, $202 million, and $156 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2016, and 2017, respectively. As of December 31, 2016 and 2017, investments accounted for under the cost method had a carrying value of $3.0 billion and $4.5 billion, respectively, and a fair value of approximately $8.1 billion and $8.8 billion, respectively. The fair value of the cost method investments are primarily determined from data leveraging private-market transactions and are classified within Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. We reflect our share of equity 65 Table of Contents Alphabet Inc. method investee earnings and losses and impairments of non-marketable equity investments as a component of other income (expense), net, in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Non-Marketable Debt Securities Our non-marketable debt securities are primarily preferred stock that are redeemable at our option and convertible notes issued by private companies and measured at fair value as available for sale debt securities. The cost of these securities was $1.1 billion as of December 31, 2016 and 2017. These debt securities do not have readily determinable market values and are categorized accordingly as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. To estimate the fair value of these securities, we use a combination of valuation methodologies, including market and income approaches based on prior transaction prices; estimated timing, probability, and amount of cash flows; and illiquidity considerations. Financial information of private companies may not be available and consequently we estimate the value based on the best available information at the measurement date. The following table presents a reconciliation for our non-marketable debt securities measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis, using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2016   2017 Beginning balance $ 1,024     $ 1,165   Total net gains (losses)           Included in earnings 0     (10 )     Included in other comprehensive income 106     707   Purchases 78     88   Sales (18 )   (2 ) Settlements (25 )   (54 ) Ending balance $ 1,165     $ 1,894 Note 5.    Variable Interest Entities (VIEs) Consolidated VIEs We consolidate VIEs in which we hold a variable interest and are the primary beneficiary. The results of operations and statements of financial position of these VIEs are included in our consolidated financial statements. For certain consolidated VIEs, their assets are not available to us and their creditors do not have recourse to us. As of December 31, 2016 and 2017, assets that can only be used to settle obligations of these VIEs were $1.1 billion and $1.7 billion, respectively, and the liabilities for which creditors do not have recourse to us were $668 million and $997 million, respectively. Calico Calico is a life science company with a mission to harness advanced technologies to increase our understanding of the biology that controls lifespan. As of December 31, 2017, we have contributed $240 million to Calico in exchange for Calico convertible preferred units and are committed to fund an additional $490 million on an as-needed basis. In September 2014, AbbVie Inc. (AbbVie) and Calico announced a research and development collaboration agreement intended to help both companies discover, develop, and bring to market new therapies for patients with age-related diseases, including neurodegeneration and cancer. As of December 31, 2017, AbbVie has contributed $750 million to fund the collaboration pursuant to the agreement, which reflects its total commitment. As of December 31, 2017, Calico has contributed $250 million and committed up to an additional $500 million. Calico has used its scientific expertise to establish a world-class research and development facility, with a focus on drug discovery and early drug development; and AbbVie provides scientific and clinical development support and its commercial expertise to bring new discoveries to market. Both companies share costs and profits equally. AbbVie's contribution has been recorded as a liability on Calico's financial statements, which is reduced and reflected as a reduction to research and development expense as eligible research and development costs are incurred by Calico. Verily Verily is a life science company with a mission to make the world's health data useful so that people enjoy healthier lives. 66 Table of Contents Alphabet Inc. In January 2017, Temasek, a Singapore-based investment company, signed a binding commitment to purchase a noncontrolling interest in Verily for an aggregate of $800 million in cash. In February 2017, the first tranche of the investment closed and we received $480 million. The second and final tranche of the investment closed in July 2017 and we received the remaining $320 million. The transaction is accounted for as an equity transaction and no gain or loss was recognized. Of the $800 million received, $78 million was recorded as noncontrolling interest and $722 million was recorded as additional paid-in capital. Noncontrolling interest and net loss attributable to noncontrolling interest were not separately presented on our consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2017 as the amounts were not material. Unconsolidated VIEs Certain renewable energy investments included in our non-marketable equity investments accounted for under the equity method are VIEs. These entities' activities involve power generation using renewable sources. We have determined that the governance structures of these entities do not allow us to direct the activities that would significantly impact their economic performance such as setting operating budgets. Therefore, we do not consolidate these VIEs in our consolidated financial statements. The carrying value and maximum exposure of these VIEs were $1.2 billion and $0.9 billion as of December 31, 2016 and 2017, respectively. The maximum exposure is based on current investments to date.  We have determined the single source of our exposure to these VIEs is our capital investment in them. Other unconsolidated VIEs were not material as of December 31, 2016 and 2017. Note 6.    Debt Short-Term Debt We have a debt financing program of up to $5.0 billion through the issuance of commercial paper. Net proceeds from this program are used for general corporate purposes. We had no commercial paper outstanding as of December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2017, respectively. Long-Term Debt Google issued $3.0 billion of senior unsecured notes in three tranches (collectively, 2011 Notes) in May 2011, due in 2014, 2016, and 2021, as well as $1.0 billion of senior unsecured notes (2014 Notes) in February 2014 due in 2024. In April 2016, we completed an exchange offer with eligible holders of Google's 2011 Notes due 2021 and 2014 Notes due 2024 (collectively, the Google Notes). An aggregate principal amount of approximately $1.7 billion of the Google Notes was exchanged for approximately $1.7 billion of Alphabet notes with identical interest rate and maturity. Because the exchange was between a parent and the subsidiary company and for substantially identical notes, the change was treated as a debt modification for accounting purposes with no gain or loss recognized. In August 2016, Alphabet issued $2.0 billion of senior unsecured notes (2016 Notes) due 2026. The net proceeds from the issuance of the 2016 Notes were used for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of outstanding commercial paper. The Alphabet notes due in 2021, 2024, and 2026 rank equally with each other and are structurally subordinate to the outstanding Google Notes. The total outstanding long-term debt is summarized below (in millions): As of  December 31, 2016   As of December 31, 2017 3.625% Notes due on May 19, 2021 $ 1,000     $ 1,000   3.375% Notes due on February 25, 2024 1,000     1,000   1.998% Notes due on August 15, 2026 2,000     2,000   Unamortized discount for the Notes above (65 )   (57 ) Subtotal(1) $ 3,935     $ 3,943   Capital lease obligation 0     26   Total long-term debt $ 3,935     $ 3,969 (1)  Includes the outstanding (and unexchanged) Google Notes issued in 2011 and 2014 and the Alphabet notes exchanged in 2016. The effective interest yields based on proceeds received from the outstanding notes due in 2021, 2024, and 2026 were 3.734%, 3.377%, and 2.231%, respectively, with interest payable semi-annually.  We may redeem these notes at any time in whole or in part at specified redemption prices. The total estimated fair value of all outstanding notes 67 Table of Contents Alphabet Inc. was approximately $3.9 billion as of December 31, 2016 and $4.0 billion as of December 31, 2017. The fair value was determined based on observable market prices of identical instruments in less active markets and is categorized accordingly as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. As of December 31, 2017, the aggregate future principal payments for long-term debt including long-term capital leases for each of the next five years and thereafter are as follows (in millions): 2018   $ 0   2019   1   2020   1   2021   1,001   2022   1   Thereafter   3,022   Total   $ 4,026 Credit Facility We have a $4.0 billion revolving credit facility which expires in February 2021. The interest rate for the credit facility is determined based on a formula using certain market rates. No amounts were outstanding under the credit facility as of December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2017. Note 7.

Note Receivable In connection with the sale of our Motorola Mobile business to Lenovo Group Limited (Lenovo) in October 2014, we received an interest-free, three-year prepayable promissory note (Note Receivable) due October 2017. The Note Receivable was included on our Consolidated Balance Sheets in other current assets as of December 31, 2016. Based on the general market conditions and the credit quality of Lenovo at the time of the sale, we discounted the Note Receivable at an effective interest rate of 4.5%. As of December 31, 2016, the outstanding principal was $1.4 billion with an unamortized discount of $51 million, and we did not recognize a valuation allowance. The Note Receivable was fully repaid in May 2017. 68 Table of Contents Alphabet Inc.

(2) Our foreign currency exchange losses, net, are related to the option premium costs and forward points for our foreign currency hedging contracts, our foreign exchange transaction gains and losses from the conversion of the transaction currency to the functional currency, offset by the foreign currency hedging contract losses and gains. The net foreign currency transaction losses were $123 million, $112 million, and $226 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2016, and 2017, respectively. Note 8.    Acquisitions 2017 Acquisitions During the year ended December 31, 2017, we completed various acquisitions and purchases of intangible assets for total consideration of approximately $322 million. In aggregate, $12 million was cash acquired, $117 million was attributed to intangible assets, $221 million was attributed to goodwill, and $28 million was attributed to net liabilities assumed. These acquisitions generally enhance the breadth and depth of our offerings and expand our expertise in engineering and other functional areas. The amount of goodwill expected to be deductible for tax purposes is approximately $60 million. Pro forma results of operations for these acquisitions have not been presented because they are not material to the consolidated results of operations, either individually or in aggregate. For all intangible assets acquired and purchased during the year ended December 31, 2017, patents and developed technology have a weighted-average useful life of 3.7 years, customer relationships have a weighted-average useful life of 2.0 years, and trade names and other have a weighted-average useful life of 8.8 years. Agreement with HTC Corporation (HTC) In January 2018, we completed the acquisition of a team of engineers and a non-exclusive license of intellectual property from HTC for $1.1 billion in cash. The transaction will be accounted for as a business combination. We expect this transaction to accelerate Google's ongoing hardware efforts. We are currently in the process of valuing the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction. We will provide all required disclosures upon the completion of the valuation in the first quarter of 2018. 2016 Acquisitions Apigee In October 2016, we completed the acquisition of Apigee Corp., a provider of application programming interface (API) management, for approximately $571 million in cash. We expect the acquisition to accelerate our Google Cloud customers' move to supporting their businesses with high quality digital interactions. Of the total purchase price of $571 million, $41 million was cash acquired, $127 million was attributed to intangible assets, $376 million was attributed to goodwill, and $27 million was attributed to net assets acquired. Goodwill, which was recorded in the Google segment, is primarily attributable to synergies expected to arise after the acquisition and is not deductible for tax purposes. Other Acquisitions During the year ended December 31, 2016, we completed other acquisitions and purchases of intangible assets for total consideration of approximately $448 million. In aggregate, $12 million was cash acquired, $143 million was attributed to intangible assets, $288 million was attributed to goodwill, and $5 million was attributed to net assets acquired. These acquisitions generally enhance the breadth and depth of our offerings, as well as expanding our 70 Table of Contents Alphabet Inc. expertise in engineering and other functional areas. The amount of goodwill expected to be deductible for tax purposes is approximately $67 million. Pro forma results of operations for these acquisitions have not been presented because they are not material to the consolidated results of operations, either individually or in aggregate. For all intangible assets acquired and purchased during the year ended December 31, 2016, patents and developed technology have a weighted-average useful life of 4.5 years, customer relationships have a weighted-average useful life of 3.4 years, and trade names and other have a weighted-average useful life of 6.2 years.

Amortization expense relating to purchased intangible assets was $892 million, $833 million, and $796 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2016, and 2017, respectively. 71 Table of Contents Alphabet Inc. As of December 31, 2017, expected amortization expense relating to purchased intangible assets for each of the next five years and thereafter are as follows (in millions): 2018 $ 728   2019 615   2020 493   2021 459   2022 212   Thereafter 185     $ 2,692 Note 10.    Commitments and Contingencies Operating Leases We have entered into various non-cancelable operating lease agreements for certain of our offices, facilities, land, and data centers throughout the world with lease periods expiring between 2018 and 2063. We are committed to pay a portion of the actual operating expenses under certain of these lease agreements. These operating expenses are not included in the table below. Certain of these arrangements have free or escalating rent payment provisions. We recognize rent expense on a straight-line basis. As of December 31, 2017, future minimum payments under operating leases having initial or remaining non-cancelable lease terms in excess of one year, net of sublease income amounts, were as follows (in millions): Operating Leases(1)   Sub-lease Income   Net Operating Leases 2018 $ 1,175     $ 15     $ 1,160   2019 1,133     13     1,120   2020 1,073     11     1,062   2021 975     7     968   2022 831     3     828   Thereafter 3,616     1     3,615   Total minimum payments $ 8,803     $ 50     $ 8,753 (1) Includes future minimum payments for leases which have not yet commenced. We have entered into certain non-cancelable lease agreements with lease periods expiring between 2021 and 2044 where we are the deemed owner for accounting purposes of new construction projects. Excluded from the table above are future minimum lease payments under such leases totaling approximately $2.1 billion, for which a $1.3 billion liability is included on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2017. Rent expense under operating leases was $734 million, $897 million, and $1.1 billion for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2016, and 2017, respectively. Purchase Obligations As of December 31, 2017, we had $7.2 billion of other non-cancelable contractual obligations, primarily related to data center operations and build-outs, digital media content licensing, and purchases of inventory. Indemnifications In the normal course of business, to facilitate transactions in our services and products, we indemnify certain parties, including advertisers, Google Network Members, and lessors with respect to certain matters. We have agreed to hold certain parties harmless against losses arising from a breach of representations or covenants, or out of intellectual property infringement or other claims made against certain parties. Several of these agreements limit the time within which an indemnification claim can be made and the amount of the claim. In addition, we have entered into indemnification agreements with our officers and directors, and our bylaws contain similar indemnification obligations to our agents. It is not possible to make a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential amount under these indemnification agreements due to the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement. Additionally, we have 72 Table of Contents Alphabet Inc. a limited history of prior indemnification claims and the payments we have made under such agreements have not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows, or financial position. However, to the extent that valid indemnification claims arise in the future, future payments by us could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows in a particular period. As of December 31, 2017, we did not have any material indemnification claims that were probable or reasonably possible. Legal Matters Antitrust Investigations On November 30, 2010, the European Commission's (EC) Directorate General for Competition opened an investigation into various antitrust-related complaints against us. On April 15, 2015, the EC issued a Statement of Objections (SO) regarding the display and ranking of shopping search results and ads, to which we responded on August 27, 2015. On July 14, 2016, the EC issued a Supplementary SO regarding shopping search results and ads. On June 27, 2017, the EC announced its decision that certain actions taken by Google regarding its display and ranking of shopping search results and ads infringed European competition law. The EC decision imposed a 2.42 billion (approximately $2.74 billion as of June 27, 2017) fine. On September 11, 2017, we appealed the EC decision and on September 27, 2017, we implemented product changes to bring shopping ads into compliance with the EC's decision. We recognized a charge of approximately $2.74 billion for the fine in the second quarter of 2017. The fine is included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as we provided bank guarantees in lieu of a cash payment for the fine. On April 20, 2016, the EC issued an SO regarding certain Android distribution practices. On July 14, 2016, the EC issued an SO regarding the syndication of AdSense for Search. We responded to the SOs and continue to respond to the EC's informational requests. There is significant uncertainty as to the outcomes of these investigations; however, adverse decisions could result in fines and directives to alter or terminate certain conduct. Given the nature of these cases, we are unable to estimate the reasonably possible loss or ranges of loss, if any.  We remain committed to working with the EC to resolve these matters. The Comision Nacional de Defensa de la Competencia in Argentina, the Competition Commission of India (CCI), Brazil's Council for Economic Defense (CADE), and the Korean Fair Trade Commission have also opened investigations into certain of our business practices. In November 2016, we responded to the CCI Director General's report with interim findings of competition law infringements regarding search and ads. Patent and Intellectual Property Claims We have had patent, copyright, and trademark infringement lawsuits filed against us claiming that certain of our products, services, and technologies infringe the intellectual property rights of others. Adverse results in these lawsuits may include awards of substantial monetary damages, costly royalty or licensing agreements, or orders preventing us from offering certain features, functionalities, products, or services, and may also cause us to change our business practices, and require development of non-infringing products or technologies, which could result in a loss of revenues for us and otherwise harm our business. In addition, the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) has increasingly become an important forum to litigate intellectual property disputes because an ultimate loss for a company or its suppliers in an ITC action could result in a prohibition on importing infringing products into the U.S. Because the U.S. is an important market, a prohibition on importation could have an adverse effect on us, including preventing us from importing many important products into the U.S. or necessitating workarounds that may limit certain features of our products. Furthermore, many of our agreements with our customers and partners require us to indemnify them for certain intellectual property infringement claims against them, which would increase our costs as a result of defending such claims, and may require that we pay significant damages if there were an adverse ruling in any such claims. Our customers and partners may discontinue the use of our products, services, and technologies, as a result of injunctions or otherwise, which could result in loss of revenues and adversely impact our business. Oracle America, Inc. (Oracle) brought a copyright lawsuit against Google in the Northern District of California, alleging that Google's Android operating system infringes Oracle's copyrights related to certain Java application programming interfaces. After trial, final judgment was entered by the district court in favor of Google on June 8, 2016, and the court decided post-trial motions in favor of Google. Oracle has appealed. We believe this lawsuit is without merit and are defending ourselves vigorously. Given the nature of this case, we are unable to estimate the reasonably possible loss or range of loss, if any, arising from this matter. 73 Table of Contents Alphabet Inc. Other We are also regularly subject to claims, suits, regulatory and government investigations, and other proceedings involving competition (such as the pending EC investigations described above), intellectual property, privacy, tax, labor and employment, commercial disputes, content generated by our users, goods and services offered by advertisers or publishers using our platforms, personal injury, consumer protection, and other matters. Such claims, suits, regulatory and government investigations, and other proceedings could result in fines, civil or criminal penalties, or other adverse consequences. Certain of our outstanding legal matters include speculative claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts of damages. We record a liability when we believe that it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If we determine that a loss is reasonably possible and the loss or range of loss can be estimated, we disclose the reasonably possible loss. We evaluate developments in our legal matters that could affect the amount of liability that has been previously accrued, and the matters and related reasonably possible losses disclosed, and make adjustments as appropriate. Significant judgment is required to determine both likelihood of there being, and the estimated amount of, a loss related to such matters. With respect to our outstanding legal matters, based on our current knowledge, we believe that the amount or range of reasonably possible loss will not, either individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. However, the outcome of such legal matters is inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties. We expense legal fees in the period in which they are incurred. Non-Income Taxes We are under audit by various domestic and foreign tax authorities with regards to non-income tax matters. The subject matter of non-income tax audits primarily arises from disputes on the tax treatment and tax rate applied to the sale of our products and services in these jurisdictions and the tax treatment of certain employee benefits. We accrue non-income taxes that may result from examinations by, or any negotiated agreements with, these tax authorities when a loss is probable and reasonably estimable. If we determine that a loss is reasonably possible and the loss or range of loss can be estimated, we disclose the reasonably possible loss. We believe these matters are without merit and we are defending ourselves vigorously. Due to the inherent complexity and uncertainty of these matters and judicial process in certain jurisdictions, the final outcome may be materially different from our expectations. For information regarding income tax contingencies, see Note 14. Note 11.    Stockholders' Equity Convertible Preferred Stock Our board of directors has authorized 100 million shares of convertible preferred stock, $0.001 par value, issuable in series. As of December 31, 2016 and 2017, no shares were issued or outstanding. Class A and Class B Common Stock and Class C Capital Stock Our board of directors has authorized three classes of stock, Class A and Class B common stock, and Class C capital stock. The rights of the holders of each class of our common and capital stock are identical, except with respect to voting. Each share of Class A common stock is entitled to one vote per share. Each share of Class B common stock is entitled to 10 votes per share. Class C capital stock has no voting rights, except as required by applicable law. Shares of Class B common stock may be converted at any time at the option of the stockholder and automatically convert upon sale or transfer to Class A common stock. Share Repurchases In October 2015, the board of directors of Alphabet authorized the company to repurchase up to $5.1 billion of its Class C capital stock, commencing in the fourth quarter of 2015. In January 2016, the board of directors of Alphabet authorized the company to repurchase an additional amount of approximately 514,000 shares. The repurchases were executed, subject to general business and market conditions and other investment opportunities, through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions, including through the use of 10b5-1 plans. During 2016, we repurchased and subsequently retired 5.2 million shares of Alphabet Class C capital stock for an aggregate amount of $3.7 billion. We completed all authorized share repurchases under this repurchase program as of June 2016. In October 2016, the board of directors of Alphabet authorized the company to repurchase up to $7.0 billion of its Class C capital stock. The repurchases are being executed from time to time, subject to general business and market conditions and other investment opportunities, through open market purchases or privately negotiated 74 Table of Contents Alphabet Inc. transactions, including through Rule 10b5-1 plans. The repurchase program does not have an expiration date. During 2017, we repurchased and subsequently retired 5.2 million shares of Alphabet Class C capital stock for an aggregate amount of $4.8 billion. Note 12.    Net Income Per Share We compute net income per share of Class A and Class B common stock and Class C capital stock using the two-class method. Basic net income per share is computed using the weighted-average number of shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net income per share is computed using the weighted-average number of shares and the effect of potentially dilutive securities outstanding during the period. Potentially dilutive securities consist of restricted stock units and other contingently issuable shares. The dilutive effect of outstanding restricted stock units and other contingently issuable shares is reflected in diluted earnings per share by application of the treasury stock method. The computation of the diluted net income per share of Class A common stock assumes the conversion of Class B common stock, while the diluted net income per share of Class B common stock does not assume the conversion of those shares. The rights, including the liquidation and dividend rights, of the holders of our Class A and Class B common stock and Class C capital stock are identical, except with respect to voting. Furthermore, there are a number of safeguards built into our certificate of incorporation, as well as Delaware law, which preclude our board of directors from declaring or paying unequal per share dividends on our Class A and Class B common stock and Class C capital stock. Specifically, Delaware law provides that amendments to our certificate of incorporation which would have the effect of adversely altering the rights, powers, or preferences of a given class of stock must be approved by the class of stock adversely affected by the proposed amendment. In addition, our certificate of incorporation provides that before any such amendment may be put to a stockholder vote, it must be approved by the unanimous consent of our board of directors. As a result, the undistributed earnings for each year are allocated based on the contractual participation rights of the Class A and Class B common shares and Class C capital stock as if the earnings for the year had been distributed. As the liquidation and dividend rights are identical, the undistributed earnings are allocated on a proportionate basis. Furthermore, as we assume the conversion of Class B common stock in the computation of the diluted net income per share of Class A common stock, the undistributed earnings are equal to net income for that computation. In the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2017, the net income per share amounts are the same for Class A and Class B common stock and Class C capital stock because the holders of each class are legally entitled to equal per share dividends or distributions in liquidation in accordance with the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of Alphabet Inc. In the year ended December 31, 2015, the Class C Adjustment Payment was allocated to the numerator for calculating net income per share of Class C capital stock from net income available to all stockholders and the remaining undistributed earnings were allocated on a pro rata basis to Class A and Class B common stock and Class C capital stock based on the number of shares used in the per share computation for each class of stock. The weighted-average share impact of the Class C Adjustment Payment is included in the denominator of both basic and diluted net income per share computations for the year ended December 31, 2015. The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted net income per share of Class A and Class B common stock and Class C capital stock (in millions, except share amounts which are reflected in thousands and per share amounts): 75 Table of Contents Alphabet Inc.

Compensation Plans Stock Plans Under our 2012 Stock Plan, RSUs or stock options may be granted. An RSU award is an agreement to issue shares of our publicly traded stock at the time the award vests. Incentive and non-qualified stock options, or rights to purchase common stock, are generally granted for a term of 10 years. RSUs granted to participants under the 2012 Stock Plan generally vest over four years contingent upon employment or service with us on the vesting date. As of December 31, 2017, there were 38,505,768 shares of stock reserved for future issuance under our Stock Plan. Stock-Based Compensation For the years ended December 31, 2015, 2016 and 2017, total stock-based compensation expense was $5.3 billion, $6.9 billion and $7.9 billion, including amounts associated with awards we expect to settle in Alphabet stock of $5.2 billion, $6.7 billion, and $7.7 billion, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2015, 2016 and 2017, we recognized tax benefits on total stock-based compensation expense, which are reflected in the provision for income taxes in the Consolidated Statements of Income, of $1.1 billion, $1.5 billion, and $1.6 billion, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2015, 2016 and 2017, tax benefit realized related to awards vested or exercised during the period was $1.5 billion, $2.1 billion and $2.7 billion, respectively. These amounts do not include the indirect effects of stock-based awards, which primarily relate to the research and development tax credit. 78 Table of Contents Alphabet Inc.

Total fair value of RSUs, as of their respective vesting dates, during the years ended December 31, 2015, 2016, and 2017 were $6.9 billion, $9.0 billion, and $11.3 billion, respectively. As of December 31, 2017, there was $12.9 billion of unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested employee RSUs. This amount is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.4 years. 401(k) Plans We have two 401(k) Savings Plans that qualify as deferred salary arrangements under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. Under these 401(k) Plans, matching contributions are based upon the amount of the employees' contributions subject to certain limitations. We contributed approximately $309 million, $385 million, and $448 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2016, and 2017, respectively. Note 14.    Income Taxes Income from continuing operations before income taxes included income from domestic operations of $8.3 billion, $12.0 billion, and $10.7 billion for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2016, and 2017, and income from foreign operations of $11.4 billion, $12.1 billion, and $16.5 billion for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2016, and 2017. The provision for income taxes consists of the following (in millions): Year Ended December 31,   2015   2016   2017 Current:           Federal and state $ 2,838     $ 3,826     $ 12,608   Foreign 723     966     1,746   Total 3,561     4,792     14,354   Deferred:           Federal and state (241 )   (70 )   220   Foreign (17 )   (50 )   (43 ) Total (258 )   (120 )   177   Provision for income taxes $ 3,303     $ 4,672     $ 14,531 The U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Tax Act) was enacted on December 22, 2017 and introduces significant changes to U.S. income tax law. Effective in 2018, the Tax Act reduces the U.S. statutory tax rate from 35% to 21% and creates new taxes on certain foreign-sourced earnings and certain related-party payments, which are referred to as the global intangible low-taxed income tax and the base erosion tax, respectively. In addition, in 2017 we were subject to a one-time transition tax on accumulated foreign subsidiary earnings not previously subject to U.S. income tax. Due to the timing of the enactment and the complexity involved in applying the provisions of the Tax Act, we have made reasonable estimates of the effects and recorded provisional amounts in our financial statements as of December 31, 2017. As we collect and prepare necessary data, and interpret the Tax Act and any additional guidance issued by the U.S. Treasury Department, the IRS, and other standard-setting bodies, we may make adjustments to the provisional amounts. Those adjustments may materially impact our provision for income taxes and effective tax rate in the period in which the adjustments are made. The accounting for the tax effects of the Tax Act will be completed in 2018. 79 Table of Contents Alphabet Inc. Provisional amounts for the following income tax effects of the Tax Act have been recorded as of December 31, 2017 and are subject to change during 2018. One-time transition tax The Tax Act requires us to pay U.S. income taxes on accumulated foreign subsidiary earnings not previously subject to U.S. income tax at a rate of 15.5% to the extent of foreign cash and certain other net current assets and 8% on the remaining earnings. We recorded a provisional amount for our one-time transitional tax liability and income tax expense of $10.2 billion. We have recorded provisional amounts based on estimates of the effects of the Tax Act as the analysis requires significant data from our foreign subsidiaries that is not regularly collected or analyzed. Deferred tax effects The Tax Act reduces the U.S. statutory tax rate from 35% to 21% for years after 2017. Accordingly, we have remeasured our deferred taxes as of December 31, 2017 to reflect the reduced rate that will apply in future periods when these deferred taxes are settled or realized. We recognized a deferred tax benefit of $376 million to reflect the reduced U.S. tax rate and other effects of the Tax Act. Although the tax rate reduction is known, we have not collected the necessary data to complete our analysis of the effect of the Tax Act on the underlying deferred taxes and as such, the amounts recorded as of December 31, 2017 are provisional. The net tax expense recognized in 2017 related to the Tax Act was $9.9 billion. As we complete our analysis of the Tax Act and incorporate additional guidance that may be issued by the U.S. Treasury Department, the IRS or other standard-setting bodies, we may identify additional effects not reflected as of December 31, 2017. The reconciliation of federal statutory income tax rate to our effective income tax rate is as follows: Year Ended December 31,   2015   2016   2017 U.S. federal statutory tax rate 35.0  %   35.0  %   35.0  % Foreign income taxed at different rates (13.4 )%   (11.0 )%   (14.2 )% Impact of the Tax Act                 One-time transition tax 0.0  %   0.0  %   37.6  % Deferred tax effects 0.0  %   0.0  %   (1.4 )% Federal research credit (2.1 )%   (2.0 )%   (1.8 )% Stock-based compensation expense 0.3  %   (3.4 )%   (4.5 )% European Commission Fine 0.0  %   0.0  %   3.5  % Other adjustments (3.0 )%   0.7  %   (0.8 )% Effective tax rate 16.8  %   19.3  %   53.4  % Our effective tax rate for each of the years presented was impacted by earnings realized in foreign jurisdictions with statutory tax rates lower than the federal statutory tax rate. Substantially all of the income from foreign operations was earned by an Irish subsidiary. Beginning in 2018, earnings realized in foreign jurisdictions will be subject to U.S. tax in accordance with the Tax Act. On July 27, 2015, the United States Tax Court, in an opinion in Altera Corp. v. Commissioner, invalidated the portion of the Treasury regulations issued under IRC Section 482 requiring related-party participants in a cost sharing arrangement to share stock-based compensation costs. The U.S. Tax Court issued the final decision on December 28, 2015. The IRS served a Notice of Appeal on February 22, 2016 and the case is being heard by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. At this time, the U.S. Treasury has not withdrawn the requirement to include stock-based compensation from its regulations. We have evaluated the opinion and continue to record a tax benefit related to reimbursement of cost share payments for the previously shared stock-based compensation costs. In accordance with the Tax Act, the Altera tax benefit was remeasured from 35% to 21%.  We also remeasured the tax benefit expected to be realized upon settlement including the expected future new taxes enacted by the Tax Act due upon resolution of the matter. The tax liability recorded as of December 31, 2016 for the U.S. tax cost of the potential repatriation associated with the contingent foreign earnings was reversed due to the Tax Act introducing a territorial tax system and providing a 100% dividend received deduction on certain qualified dividends from foreign subsidiaries. We will continue to monitor developments related to the case and the potential impact on our consolidated financial statements. 80 Table of Contents Alphabet Inc. Deferred Income Taxes Deferred income taxes reflect the net effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. We recorded a provisional adjustment to our U.S. deferred income taxes as of December 31, 2017 to reflect the reduction in the U.S. statutory tax rate from 35% to 21% resulting from the Tax Act. Significant components of our deferred tax assets and liabilities are as follows (in millions): As of December 31,   2016   2017 Deferred tax assets:       Stock-based compensation expense $ 574     $ 251   Accrued employee benefits 939     285   Accruals and reserves not currently deductible 500     717   Tax credits 631     1,187   Basis difference in investment of Arris 1,327     849   Prepaid cost sharing 4,409     498   Net Operating Losses 305     320   Other 621     379   Total deferred tax assets 9,306     4,486   Valuation allowance (2,076 )   (2,531 ) Total deferred tax assets net of valuation allowance 7,230     1,955   Deferred tax liabilities:       Depreciation and amortization (877 )   (551 ) Identified intangibles (844 )   (419 ) Renewable energy investments (788 )   (531 ) Foreign earnings (4,409 )   (68 ) Other (155 )   (136 ) Total deferred tax liabilities (7,073 )   (1,705 ) Net deferred tax assets $ 157     $ 250 As of December 31, 2017, our federal and state net operating loss carryforwards for income tax purposes were approximately $931 million and $785 million, respectively. If not utilized, the federal net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in 2021 and the state net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in 2018. It is more likely than not that certain federal net operating loss carryforwards and our state net operating loss carryforwards will not be realized; therefore, we have recorded a valuation allowance against them. The net operating loss carryforwards are subject to various annual limitations under the tax laws of the different jurisdictions. Our foreign net operating loss carryforwards for income tax purposes were $327 million that will begin to expire in 2021. As of December 31, 2017, our California research and development credit carryforwards for income tax purposes were approximately $1.8 billion that can be carried over indefinitely. We believe the state tax credit is not likely to be realized. As of December 31, 2017, we maintained a valuation allowance with respect to certain of our deferred tax assets relating primarily to investment losses that are capital in nature, California deferred tax assets, certain federal net operating losses, and certain foreign net operating losses that we believe are not likely to be realized. We established a deferred tax asset for the book-to-tax basis difference in our investments in Arris shares received from the sale of the Motorola Home business to Arris in 2013. Since any future losses to be recognized upon the sale of Arris shares will be capital losses, a valuation allowance has been recorded against this deferred tax asset to the extent such deferred tax asset is not likely to be covered by capital gains generated as of December 31, 2017. We reassess the valuation allowance quarterly and if future evidence allows for a partial or full release of the valuation allowance, a tax benefit will be recorded accordingly. 81 Table of Contents Alphabet Inc. Uncertain Tax Positions The following table summarizes the activity related to our gross unrecognized tax benefits from January 1, 2015 to December 31, 2017 (in millions): 2015   2016   2017 Beginning gross unrecognized tax benefits $ 3,294     $ 4,167     $ 5,393   Increases related to prior year tax positions 224     899     685   Decreases related to prior year tax positions (176 )   (157 )   (257 ) Decreases related to settlement with tax authorities (27 )   (196 )   (1,875 ) Increases related to current year tax positions 852     680     750   Ending gross unrecognized tax benefits $ 4,167     $ 5,393     $ 4,696 The total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was $4.2 billion, $5.4 billion, and $4.7 billion as of December 31, 2015, 2016, and 2017, respectively, of which, $3.6 billion, $4.3 billion, and $3.0 billion if recognized, would affect our effective tax rate. The decrease in gross unrecognized tax benefits in 2017 was primarily as a result of the resolution of a multi-year U.S. audit. As of December 31, 2016 and 2017, we had accrued $493 million and $362 million in interest and penalties in provision for income taxes, respectively. We file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and in many state and foreign jurisdictions, our two major tax jurisdictions are the U.S. federal and Ireland. We are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the IRS and other tax authorities. The IRS completed its examination through our 2012 tax years; all issues have been concluded except for one which is currently under review in the U.S. Tax Court. The IRS is currently examining our 2013 through 2015 tax returns. We have also received tax assessments in multiple foreign jurisdictions asserting transfer pricing adjustments or permanent establishment. We continue to defend any and all such claims as presented. Our 2016 tax year remains subject to examination by the IRS for U.S. federal tax purposes, and our 2011 through 2016 tax years remain subject to examination by the appropriate governmental agencies for Irish tax purposes. There are other ongoing audits in various other jurisdictions that are not material to our financial statements. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. We continue to monitor the progress of ongoing discussions with tax authorities and the impact, if any, of the expected expiration of the statute of limitations in various taxing jurisdictions. We believe that an adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations. However, the outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty. If any issues addressed in our tax audits are resolved in a manner not consistent with management's expectations, we could be required to adjust our provision for income taxes in the period such resolution occurs. Although the timing of resolution, settlement, closure of audits is not certain, it is reasonably possible that certain U.S. federal and non-U.S. tax audits may be concluded within the next 12 months, which could significantly increase or decrease the balance of our gross unrecognized tax benefits. We estimate that our unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2017 could possibly decrease by approximately $500 million in the next 12 months. Positions that may be resolved include various U.S. and non-U.S. matters. Note 15.    Information about Segments and Geographic Areas We operate our business in multiple operating segments. Google is our only reportable segment. None of our other segments meet the quantitative thresholds to qualify as reportable segments; therefore, the other operating segments are combined and disclosed as Other Bets. Our reported segments are:  Google  -  Google includes our main products such as Ads, Android, Chrome, Commerce, Google Cloud, Google Maps, Google Play, Hardware, Search, and YouTube. Our technical infrastructure and some newer efforts like virtual reality are also included in Google. Google generates revenues primarily from advertising; sales of apps, in-app purchases, digital content products, and hardware; and licensing and service fees, including fees received for Google Cloud offerings.  Other Bets  -  Other Bets is a combination of multiple operating segments that are not individually material. Other Bets includes businesses such as Access, Calico, CapitalG, GV, Nest, Verily, Waymo, and X. Revenues 82 Table of Contents Alphabet Inc. from the Other Bets are derived primarily through the sales of internet and TV services through Fiber, sales of Nest products and services, and licensing and R&D services through Verily.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Our management, with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act, as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Based on this evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that, as of December 31, 2017, our disclosure controls and procedures are designed at a reasonable assurance level and are effective to provide reasonable assurance that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2017 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 84 Table of Contents Alphabet Inc. Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act. Our management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework). Based on this evaluation, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2017. Management reviewed the results of its assessment with our Audit Committee. The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017 has been audited by Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in its report which is included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs.","https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1652044/0001652044-18-000007-index.html"
"JPMORGAN CHASE & CO","10-K","2018","1","Item 1. Business. Overview JPMorgan Chase & Co. (""JPMorgan Chase"" or the ""Firm""), a financial holding company incorporated under Delaware law in 1968, is a leading global financial services firm and one of the largest banking institutions in the United States of America (""U.S.""), with operations worldwide; the Firm had $2.5 trillion in assets and $255.7 billion in stockholders' equity as of December 31, 2017. The Firm is a leader in investment banking, financial services for consumers and small businesses, commercial banking, financial transaction processing and asset management. Under the J.P. Morgan and Chase brands, the Firm serves millions of customers in the U.S. and many of the world's most prominent corporate, institutional and government clients. JPMorgan Chase's principal bank subsidiaries are JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association (""JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.""), a national banking association with U.S. branches in 23 states, and Chase Bank USA, National Association (""Chase Bank USA, N.A.""), a national banking association that is the Firm's principal credit card-issuing bank. JPMorgan Chase's principal nonbank subsidiary is J.P. Morgan Securities LLC (""JPMorgan Securities""), a U.S. broker-dealer. The bank and non-bank subsidiaries of JPMorgan Chase operate nationally as well as through overseas branches and subsidiaries, representative offices and subsidiary foreign banks. The Firm's principal operating subsidiary in the U.K. is J.P. Morgan Securities plc, a subsidiary of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. The Firm's website is www.jpmorganchase.com. JPMorgan Chase makes available free of charge, through its website, annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K pursuant to Section 13(a) or Section 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as soon as reasonably practicable after it electronically files such material with, or furnishes such material to, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the ""SEC"") at www.sec.gov. The Firm has adopted, and posted on its website, a Code of Conduct for all employees of the Firm and a Code of Ethics for its Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Principal Accounting Officer and all other professionals of the Firm worldwide serving in a finance, accounting, tax or investor relations role. Business segments JPMorgan Chase's activities are organized, for management reporting purposes, into four major reportable business segments, as well as a Corporate segment. The Firm's consumer business is the Consumer & Community Banking (""CCB"") segment. The Firm's wholesale business segments are Corporate & Investment Bank (""CIB""), Commercial Banking (""CB""), and Asset & Wealth Management (""AWM""). A description of the Firm's business segments and the products and services they provide to their respective client bases is provided in the ""Business segment results"" section of Management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (""MD&A""), beginning on page 40 and in Note 31. Competition JPMorgan Chase and its subsidiaries and affiliates operate in a highly competitive environment. Competitors include other banks, brokerage firms, investment banking companies, merchant banks, hedge funds, commodity trading companies, private equity firms, insurance companies, mutual fund companies, investment managers, credit card companies, mortgage banking companies, trust companies, securities processing companies, automobile financing companies, leasing companies, e-commerce and other Internet-based companies, financial technology companies, and other companies engaged in providing similar products and services. The Firm's businesses generally compete on the basis of the quality and variety of the Firm's products and services, transaction execution, innovation, reputation and price. Competition also varies based on the types of clients, customers, industries and geographies served. With respect to some of its geographies and products, JPMorgan Chase competes globally; with respect to others, the Firm competes on a national or regional basis. The Firm's ability to compete also depends on its ability to attract and retain professional and other personnel, and on its reputation. It is likely that competition in the financial services industry will continue to be intense as the Firm's businesses compete with other financial institutions that may have a stronger local presence in certain geographies or that operate under different rules and regulatory regimes than the Firm, or with companies that provide new or innovative products or services that the Firm does not provide. Supervision and regulation The Firm is subject to extensive and comprehensive regulation under state and federal laws in the U.S., as well as the applicable laws of each of the various jurisdictions outside the U.S. in which the Firm does business. The Firm has experienced an extended period of significant change in regulation which has had and could continue to have significant consequences for how the Firm conducts business in the U.S. and abroad. The Firm devotes substantial resources to complying with existing and new laws, rules and regulations, while, at the same time, endeavoring to best meet the needs and expectations of its customers, clients and shareholders. As a result of legislative and regulatory changes and expanded supervision, the Firm has implemented and refined policies, procedures and controls, and made adjustments to its business and operations, legal entity structure, and capital and liquidity management. The combined effect of numerous rule-makings by multiple governmental agencies and regulators, and the potential conflicts or inconsistencies among such rules, continue to present challenges and risks to the Firm's business and operations. 1","Item 1A. Risk Factors. The following discussion sets forth the material risk factors that could affect JPMorgan Chase's financial condition and operations. Readers should not consider any descriptions of these factors to be a complete set of all potential risks that could affect the Firm. Regulatory JPMorgan Chase's businesses are highly regulated, and the laws and regulations that apply to JPMorgan Chase have a significant impact on its operations. JPMorgan Chase is a financial services firm with operations worldwide. JPMorgan Chase must comply with the laws and regulations that apply to its operations in all of the jurisdictions around the world in which it does business. The regulation of financial services activities is typically extensive and comprehensive. In recent years, legislators and regulators adopted a wide range of new laws and regulations affecting the financial services industry, both within and outside the U.S. The supervision of financial services firms also expanded significantly during this period. The wave of increased regulation and supervision of JPMorgan Chase has affected the way that it conducts and structures its operations. Existing and new laws and regulations and expanded supervision could require JPMorgan Chase to make further changes to its operations. These changes could result in JPMorgan Chase incurring additional costs for complying with laws and regulations or losing a significant amount of revenue, and could reduce JPMorgan Chase's profitability. More specifically, existing and new laws and regulations could require JPMorgan Chase to:  limit the products and services that it offers  reduce the liquidity that it can provide through its market-making activities  stop or discourage it from engaging in business opportunities that it might otherwise pursue  recognize losses in the value of assets that it holds 8  pay higher assessments, levies or other governmental charges  dispose of certain assets, and do so at times or prices that are disadvantageous  impose restrictions on certain business activities, or  increase the prices that it charges for products and services, which could reduce the demand for them. Differences in financial services regulation can be disadvantageous for JPMorgan Chase's business. The content and application of laws and regulations affecting financial services firms sometimes vary according to factors such as the size of the firm, the jurisdiction in which it is organized or operates, or other criteria. For example:  larger firms are often subject to more stringent supervision and regulation  financial technology companies and other competitors may not be subject to banking regulation, or may be supervised by a national or state regulatory agency that does not have the same resources or regulatory priorities as the regulatory agencies which supervise more diversified financial services firms, or  the financial services regulatory framework in a particular jurisdiction may favor financial institutions that are based in that country. There can also be significant differences in the ways that similar regulatory initiatives affecting the financial services industry are implemented in the U.S. and in different countries and regions in which JPMorgan Chase does business. For example, legislative and regulatory initiatives within the EU could require JPMorgan Chase to make significant modifications to its operations and legal entity structure in that region in order to comply with those requirements. These include laws and regulations that have been adopted or proposed relating to:  the resolution of financial institutions  the establishment by non-EU financial institutions of intermediate holding companies in the EU  the separation of trading activities from core banking services  mandatory on-exchange trading  position limits and reporting rules for derivatives  governance and accountability regimes  conduct of business requirements, and  restrictions on compensation. These types of differences in financial services regulation, or inconsistencies or conflicts between laws and regulations between different jurisdictions, could require JPMorgan Chase to, among other things:  divest assets or restructure its operations  absorb increased operational, capital and liquidity costs  change the prices that it charges for its products and services  curtail the products and services that it offers to its customers and clients, or  incur higher costs for complying with different legal and regulatory frameworks. Any or all of these factors could harm JPMorgan Chase's ability to compete against other firms that are not subject to the same laws and regulations or supervisory oversight, or harm JPMorgan Chase's businesses, results of operations and profitability. Governments in some countries in which JPMorgan Chase does business have adopted laws or regulations which require that JPMorgan Chase subsidiaries which operate in those countries maintain minimum amounts of capital or liquidity on a stand-alone basis. Some regulators outside the U.S. have also proposed that large banks which conduct certain businesses in their jurisdictions operate through separate subsidiaries located in those countries. These requirements, and any future laws or regulations that impose restrictions on the way JPMorgan Chase organizes its businesses or increase the capital or liquidity requirements that would apply to JPMorgan Chase subsidiaries, could hinder JPMorgan Chase's ability to efficiently manage its operations, increase its funding and liquidity costs, and result in lower profitability. Heightened regulatory scrutiny of JPMorgan Chase's businesses has increased its compliance costs and could result in restrictions on its operations. JPMorgan Chase's operations are subject to heightened oversight and scrutiny from regulatory authorities in many jurisdictions where JPMorgan Chase does business. JPMorgan Chase has paid significant fines or provided other monetary relief in connection with resolving several investigations and enforcement actions by governmental agencies. JPMorgan Chase could become subject to similar regulatory settlements or other actions in the future, and addressing the requirements of any such settlement could result in JPMorgan Chase incurring higher operational and compliance costs. In connection with resolving specific regulatory investigations or enforcement actions, certain regulators have required JPMorgan Chase and other financial institutions to admit wrongdoing with respect to the activities that gave rise to the settlement. These types of admissions can lead to:  greater exposure in civil litigation  damage to reputation  disqualification from doing business with certain clients or customers, or in specific jurisdictions, or 9","Item 7.

The internal control framework promulgated by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (""COSO""), ""Internal Control  -  Integrated Framework"" (""COSO 2013"") provides guidance for designing, implementing and conducting internal control and assessing its effectiveness. The Firm used the COSO 2013 framework to assess the effectiveness of the Firm's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017. See ""Management's report on internal control over financial reporting"" on page 146. As of the end of the period covered by this report, an evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of the Firm's management, including its Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and its Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of its disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934). Based on that evaluation, the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer concluded that these disclosure controls and procedures were effective. See Exhibits 31.1 and 31.2 for the Certifications issued by the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. The Firm is committed to maintaining high standards of internal control over financial reporting. Nevertheless, because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. In addition, in a firm as large and complex as JPMorgan Chase, lapses or deficiencies in internal controls may occur from time to time, and there can be no assurance that any such deficiencies will not result in significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in internal control in the future. For further information, see ""Management's report on internal control over financial reporting"" on page 146. There was no change in the Firm's internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) that occurred during the three months ended December 31, 2017, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Firm's internal control over financial reporting.","https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/19617/0000019617-18-000057-index.html"

Through our operations, authorized bottlers, contract manufacturers and other third parties, we make, market, distribute and sell a wide variety of convenient and enjoyable beverages, foods and snacks, serving customers and consumers in more than 200 countries and territories. Our Operations We are organized into six reportable segments (also referred to as divisions), as follows: 1) Frito-Lay North America (FLNA), which includes our branded food and snack businesses in the United States and Canada; 2) Quaker Foods North America (QFNA), which includes our cereal, rice, pasta and other branded food businesses in the United States and Canada; 3) North America Beverages (NAB), which includes our beverage businesses in the United States and Canada; 4) Latin America, which includes all of our beverage, food and snack businesses in Latin America; 5) Europe Sub-Saharan Africa (ESSA), which includes all of our beverage, food and snack businesses in Europe and Sub-Saharan Africa; and 2 Table of Contents 6) Asia, Middle East and North Africa (AMENA), which includes all of our beverage, food and snack businesses in Asia, Middle East and North Africa.

Further, we license the Tropicana brand for use in China on co-branded juice products in connection with a strategic alliance with Tingyi (Cayman Islands) Holding Corp. (Tingyi). Our Distribution Network Our products are primarily brought to market through direct-store-delivery (DSD), customer warehouse and distributor networks. The distribution system used depends on customer needs, product characteristics and local trade practices. Direct-Store-Delivery We, our independent bottlers and our distributors operate DSD systems that deliver beverages, foods and snacks directly to retail stores where the products are merchandised by our employees or our independent bottlers. DSD enables us to merchandise with maximum visibility and appeal. DSD is especially well-suited 4 Table of Contents to products that are restocked often and respond to in-store promotion and merchandising. Customer Warehouse Some of our products are delivered from our manufacturing plants and warehouses to customer warehouses. These less costly systems generally work best for products that are less fragile and perishable, and have lower turnover. Distributor Networks We distribute many of our products through third-party distributors. Third-party distributors are particularly effective when greater distribution reach can be achieved by including a wide range of products on the delivery vehicles. For example, our foodservice and vending business distributes beverages, foods and snacks to restaurants, businesses, schools and stadiums through third-party foodservice and vending distributors and operators. Our products are also available on a growing number of e-commerce websites and mobile commerce applications as consumer consumption patterns continue to change and retail increasingly expands online. Ingredients and Other Supplies The principal ingredients we use in our beverage, food and snack products are apple, orange and pineapple juice and other juice concentrates, aspartame, corn, corn sweeteners, flavorings, flour, grapefruit, oranges and other fruits, oats, potatoes, raw milk, rice, seasonings, sucralose, sugar, vegetable and essential oils, and wheat. We also use water in the manufacturing of our products. Our key packaging materials include plastic resins, including polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and polypropylene resins used for plastic beverage bottles and film packaging used for snack foods, aluminum used for cans, glass bottles, closures, cardboard and paperboard cartons. Fuel, electricity and natural gas are also important commodities for our businesses due to their use in our and our business partners' facilities and the vehicles delivering our products. We employ specialists to secure adequate supplies of many of these items and have not experienced any significant continuous shortages that would prevent us from meeting our requirements. Many of these ingredients, raw materials and commodities are purchased in the open market. The prices we pay for such items are subject to fluctuation, and we manage this risk through the use of fixed-price contracts and purchase orders, pricing agreements and derivative instruments, including swaps and futures. In addition, risk to our supply of certain raw materials is mitigated through purchases from multiple geographies and suppliers. When prices increase, we may or may not pass on such increases to our customers. In addition, we continue to make investments to improve the sustainability and resources of our agricultural supply chain, including the development of our initiative to advance sustainable farming practices by our suppliers and expanding it globally. See Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on how we manage our exposure to commodity costs. Our Brands and Intellectual Property Rights We own numerous valuable trademarks which are essential to our worldwide businesses, including Agusha, Amp Energy, Aquafina, Aquafina Flavorsplash, Aunt Jemima, Cap'n Crunch, Cheetos, Chester's, Chipsy, Chokis, Chudo, Cracker Jack, Crunchy, Diet Mist Twst, Diet Mountain Dew, Diet Mug, Diet Pepsi, Diet 7UP (outside the United States), Domik v Derevne, Doritos, Duyvis, Elma Chips, Emperador, Frito-Lay, Fritos, Fruktovy Sad, G2, Gamesa, Gatorade, Grandma's, H2oh!, Imunele, Izze, J-7 Tonus, Kas, KeVita, Kurkure, Lay's, Life, Lifewtr, Lifewater, Lubimy, Manzanita Sol, Marias Gamesa, Matutano, Mirinda, Miss Vickie's, Mist Twst, Mother's, Mountain Dew, Mountain Dew Code Red, Mountain Dew Kickstart, Mug, Munchies, Naked, Near East, O.N.E., Paso de los Toros, Pasta Roni, Pepsi, Pepsi Max, Pepsi Next, Pepsi Zero Sugar, Propel, Quaker, Quaker Chewy, Rice-A-Roni, Rold Gold, Rosquinhas Mabel, Ruffles, Sabritas, Sakata, Saladitas, Sandora, Santitas, 7UP (outside the United States), 7UP Free (outside the United States), Simba, Smartfood, Smith's, Snack a Jacks, SoBe, SoBe Lifewater, Sonric's, Stacy's, Sting, SunChips, Toddy, 5 Table of Contents Toddynho, Tostitos, Trop 50, Tropicana, Tropicana Farmstand, Tropicana Pure Premium, Tropicana Twister, V Water, Vesely Molochnik, Walkers and Ya. We also hold long-term licenses to use valuable trademarks in connection with our products in certain markets, including Dole and Ocean Spray. We also distribute Rockstar Energy drinks, Muscle Milk protein shakes and various DPSG brands, including Dr Pepper in certain markets, Crush and Schweppes. Joint ventures in which we have an ownership interest either own or have the right to use certain trademarks, such as Lipton, Sabra and Starbucks. Trademarks remain valid so long as they are used properly for identification purposes, and we emphasize correct use of our trademarks. We have authorized, through licensing arrangements, the use of many of our trademarks in such contexts as snack food joint ventures and beverage bottling appointments. In addition, we license the use of our trademarks on merchandise that is sold at retail, which enhances brand awareness. We either own or have licenses to use a number of patents which relate to certain of our products, their packaging, the processes for their production and the design and operation of various equipment used in our businesses. Some of these patents are licensed to others. Seasonality Our businesses are affected by seasonal variations. For instance, our beverage sales are higher during the warmer months and certain food and dairy sales are higher in the cooler months. Weekly beverage and snack sales are generally highest in the third quarter due to seasonal and holiday-related patterns, and generally lowest in the first quarter. However, taken as a whole, seasonality has not had a material impact on our consolidated financial results. Our Customers Our customers include wholesale and other distributors, foodservice customers, grocery stores, drug stores, convenience stores, discount/dollar stores, mass merchandisers, membership stores, hard discounters, e-commerce retailers and authorized independent bottlers, among others. We normally grant our independent bottlers exclusive contracts to sell and manufacture certain beverage products bearing our trademarks within a specific geographic area. These arrangements provide us with the right to charge our independent bottlers for concentrate, finished goods and Aquafina royalties and specify the manufacturing process required for product quality. We also grant distribution rights to our independent bottlers for certain beverage products bearing our trademarks for specified geographic areas. We rely on and provide financial incentives to our customers to assist in the distribution and promotion of our products to the consumer. For our independent distributors and retailers, these incentives include volume-based rebates, product placement fees, promotions and displays. For our independent bottlers, these incentives are referred to as bottler funding and are negotiated annually with each bottler to support a variety of trade and consumer programs, such as consumer incentives, advertising support, new product support, and vending and cooler equipment placement. Consumer incentives include coupons, pricing discounts and promotions, and other promotional offers. Advertising support is directed at advertising programs and supporting independent bottler media. New product support includes targeted consumer and retailer incentives and direct marketplace support, such as point-of-purchase materials, product placement fees, media and advertising. Vending and cooler equipment placement programs support the acquisition and placement of vending machines and cooler equipment. The nature and type of programs vary annually. Changes to the retail landscape, including increased consolidation of retail ownership, the rapid growth of sales through e-commerce websites and mobile commerce applications, the integration of physical and digital operations among retailers, as well as the growth in hard discounters, and the current economic environment continue to increase the importance of major customers. In 2017, sales to Walmart Inc. (Walmart), including Sam's Club (Sam's), represented approximately 13% of our consolidated net revenue. Our top five retail customers represented approximately 33% of our 2017 net revenue in North America, with Walmart (including 6 Table of Contents Sam's) representing approximately 19%. These percentages include concentrate sales to our independent bottlers, which were used in finished goods sold by them to these retailers. See ""Off-Balance-Sheet Arrangements"" in ""Our Financial Results  -  Our Liquidity and Capital Resources"" in Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for more information on our independent bottlers. Our Competition Our beverage, food and snack products are in highly competitive categories and markets and compete against products of international beverage, food and snack companies that, like us, operate in multiple geographies, as well as regional, local and private label manufacturers, economy brands and other competitors. In many countries in which our products are sold, including the United States, The Coca-Cola Company is our primary beverage competitor. Other beverage, food and snack competitors include, but are not limited to, DPSG, Kellogg Company, The Kraft Heinz Company, Mondelez International, Inc., Monster Beverage Corporation, Nestlé S.A., Red Bull GmbH and Snyder's-Lance, Inc. Many of our food and snack products hold significant leadership positions in the food and snack industry in the United States and worldwide. In 2017, we and The Coca-Cola Company represented approximately 23% and 20%, respectively, of the U.S. liquid refreshment beverage category by estimated retail sales in measured channels, according to Information Resources, Inc. However, The Coca-Cola Company has significant carbonated soft drink (CSD) share advantage in many markets outside the United States. Our beverage, food and snack products compete primarily on the basis of brand recognition and loyalty, taste, price, value, quality, product variety, innovation, distribution, advertising, marketing and promotional activity, packaging, convenience, service and the ability to anticipate and effectively respond to consumer preferences and trends, including increased consumer focus on health and wellness and the continued acceleration of e-commerce and other methods of distributing and purchasing products. Success in this competitive environment is dependent on effective promotion of existing products, effective introduction of new products and reformulations of existing products, the effectiveness of our advertising campaigns, marketing programs, product packaging, pricing, increased efficiency in production techniques, new vending and dispensing equipment and brand and trademark development and protection. We believe that the strength of our brands, innovation and marketing, coupled with the quality of our products and flexibility of our distribution network, allows us to compete effectively. Research and Development We engage in a variety of research and development activities and invest in innovation globally with the goal of meeting changing consumer demands and preferences and accelerating sustainable growth. These activities principally involve: development of new ingredients, flavors and products; reformulation and improvement in the quality and appeal of existing products; improvement and modernization of manufacturing processes, including cost reduction; improvements in product quality, safety and integrity; development of, and improvements in, dispensing equipment, packaging technology, package design and portion sizes; efforts focused on identifying opportunities to transform, grow and broaden our product portfolio, including by developing products with improved nutrition profiles that reduce added sugars, sodium or saturated fat, including through the use of sweetener alternatives and flavor modifiers and innovation in existing sweeteners, and by offering more products with positive nutrition including whole grains, fruits and vegetables, dairy, protein and hydration; investments in building our capabilities to support our global e-commerce business; and improvements in energy efficiency and efforts focused on reducing our impact on the environment. Our research centers are located around the world, including in Brazil, China, India, Ireland, Mexico, Russia, the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom and the United States, and leverage nutrition science, food 7 Table of Contents science, engineering and consumer insights to meet our strategy to continue to develop nutritious and convenient beverages, foods and snacks. In 2017, we continued to refine our beverage, food and snack portfolio to meet changing consumer demands by reducing added sugars in many of our beverages and sodium and saturated fat in many of our foods and snacks, and by developing a broader portfolio of product choices, including: continuing to expand our beverage options that contain no high-fructose corn syrup and that are made with natural flavors; expanding our state-of-the-art food and beverage healthy vending initiative to increase the availability of convenient, affordable and enjoyable nutrition; further expanding our portfolio of nutritious products by building on our important nutrition platforms and brands  -  Quaker (grains), Tropicana (juices, lemonades, fruit and vegetable drinks), Gatorade (sports nutrition for athletes), Naked Juice (cold-pressed juices and smoothies) and KeVita (probiotics, tonics and fermented teas); further expanding our whole grain products globally; and further expanding our portfolio of nutritious products in growing categories, such as dairy, hummus and other refrigerated dips, and baked grain snacks. In addition, we continued to make investments to reduce our impact on the environment, including: efforts to conserve raw materials and energy, such as by working to achieve reductions in greenhouse gas emissions across our global businesses, by helping to protect and conserve global water supply especially in high-water-risk locations (including replenishing watersheds that source our operations in high-water-risk locations and promoting the efficient use of water use in our agricultural supply chain), and by incorporating into our operations, improvements in the sustainability and resources of our agricultural supply chain; efforts to reduce waste generated by our operations and disposed of in landfills; efforts to support increased packaging recovery and recycling rates; efforts to increase energy efficiency, including the increased use of renewable energy and resources; efforts to support sustainable agriculture by expanding best practices with our growers and suppliers; and efforts to optimize packaging technology and design to make our packaging increasingly recoverable or recyclable with lower environmental impact, including continuing to invest in developing compostable and biodegradable packaging. Research and development costs were $737 million, $760 million and $754 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and are reported within selling, general and administrative expenses. Consumer research is excluded from such research and development costs and included in other marketing costs. Regulatory Matters The conduct of our businesses, including the production, storage, distribution, sale, display, advertising, marketing, labeling, content, quality, safety, transportation, disposal, recycling and use of our products, as well as our occupational health and safety practices and protection of personal information, are subject to various laws and regulations administered by federal, state and local governmental agencies in the United States, as well as to laws and regulations administered by government entities and agencies in the more than 200 other countries and territories in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold. It is our policy to abide by the laws and regulations around the world that apply to our businesses. The U.S. laws and regulations that we are subject to include: the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and various state laws governing food safety; the Food Safety Modernization Act; the Occupational Safety and Health Act; various federal, state and local environmental protection laws, as discussed below; the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Act; the Federal Trade Commission Act; the Lanham Act; various federal and state laws and regulations governing competition and trade practices; various federal and state laws and regulations governing our employment practices, including those related to equal employment opportunity, such as the Equal Employment Opportunity Act and the National Labor Relations Act and those related to overtime compensation, such as the Fair Labor Standards Act; customs and foreign trade laws and regulations; laws regulating the sale of certain of our products in schools; and laws relating to the payment of taxes. We are also required to comply with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act. We are also subject to various state and local statutes and regulations, including state consumer protection laws such as Proposition 65 in California, which requires that a specific warning appear 8 Table of Contents on any product that contains a substance listed by the State of California as having been found to cause cancer or birth defects, unless the amount of such substance in the product is below a safe harbor level. We are also subject to numerous similar and other laws and regulations outside the United States, including but not limited to laws and regulations governing food safety, occupational health and safety, competition, anti-corruption and data privacy. In many jurisdictions, compliance with competition laws is of special importance to us due to our competitive position in those jurisdictions, as is compliance with anti-corruption laws, including the U.K. Bribery Act. We rely on legal and operational compliance programs, as well as in-house and outside counsel and other experts, to guide our businesses in complying with the laws and regulations around the world that apply to our businesses. In addition, certain jurisdictions have either imposed, or are considering imposing, new or increased taxes on the manufacture, distribution or sale of our products, ingredients or substances contained in, or attributes of, our products or commodities used in the production of our products. These taxes vary in scope and form: some apply to all beverages, including non-caloric beverages, while others apply only to beverages with a caloric sweetener (e.g., sugar). Similarly, some measures apply a single tax rate per liquid ounce while others apply a graduated tax rate depending upon the amount of added sugar in the beverage and some apply a flat tax rate on beverages containing a particular substance or ingredient. In addition, certain jurisdictions have either imposed, or are considering imposing, product labeling or warning requirements or other limitations on the marketing or sale of certain of our products as a result of ingredients or substances contained in such products or the audience to whom products are marketed. These types of provisions have required that we provide a label that highlights perceived concerns about a product or warns consumers to avoid consumption of certain ingredients or substances present in our products. It is possible that similar or more restrictive requirements may be proposed or enacted in the future. Regulators may also restrict consumers' ability to use benefit programs, such as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program in the United States, to purchase certain beverages and foods. In addition, legislation has been enacted in certain U.S. states and in certain other countries where our products are sold that requires collection and recycling of containers or that prohibits the sale of our beverages in certain non-refillable containers, unless a deposit, ecotax or other fee is charged. It is possible that similar or more restrictive requirements may be proposed or enacted in the future. We are also subject to national and local environmental laws in the United States and in foreign countries in which we do business, including laws related to water consumption and treatment, wastewater discharge and air emissions. In the United States, our facilities must comply with the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and other federal and state laws regarding handling, storage, release and disposal of wastes generated on-site and sent to third-party owned and operated off-site licensed facilities and our facilities outside the United States must comply with similar laws and regulations. In addition, continuing concern over climate change may result in new or increased legal and regulatory requirements (in or outside of the United States) to reduce or mitigate the potential effects of greenhouse gases, or to limit or impose additional costs on commercial water use due to local water scarcity concerns. Our policy is to abide by all applicable environmental laws and regulations, and we have internal programs in place with respect to our global environmental compliance. We have made, and plan to continue making, necessary expenditures for compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations. While these expenditures have not had a material impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations to date, changes in environmental compliance requirements, and any expenditures necessary to comply with such requirements, could adversely affect our financial performance. In addition, we and our subsidiaries are subject to environmental remediation obligations arising in the normal course of business, as well as remediation and related indemnification obligations in connection with certain historical activities and contractual obligations, including those of businesses acquired by us or our subsidiaries. While these environmental remediation and indemnification 9 Table of Contents obligations cannot be predicted with certainty, such obligations have not had, and are not expected to have, a material impact on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position. In addition to the discussion in this section, see also ""Item 1A. Risk Factors."" Employees As of December 30, 2017, we and our consolidated subsidiaries employed approximately 263,000 people worldwide, including approximately 113,000 people within the United States. In certain countries, our employment levels are subject to seasonal variations. We or our subsidiaries are party to numerous collective bargaining agreements. We expect that we will be able to renegotiate these collective bargaining agreements on satisfactory terms when they expire. We believe that relations with our employees are generally good.

The information on our website is not, and shall not be deemed to be, a part hereof or incorporated into this or any of our other filings with the SEC.","Item 1A.  Risk Factors. You should carefully consider the risks described below in addition to the other information set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Any of the factors described below could occur or continue to occur and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or the price of our publicly traded securities. The risks below are not the only risks we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us, or that we currently deem to be immaterial, may occur or become material in the future and may also adversely affect our business, reputation, financial condition, results of operations or the price of our publicly traded securities. Therefore, historical operating results, financial and business performance, events and trends may not be a reliable indicator of future operating results, financial and business performance, events or trends. 10 Table of Contents Demand for our products may be adversely affected by changes in consumer preferences or any inability on our part to innovate, market or distribute our products effectively, and any significant reduction in demand could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. We are a global food and beverage company operating in highly competitive categories and markets. To generate revenues and profits, we rely on continued demand for our products and therefore must understand our customers and consumers and sell products that appeal to them in the sales channel in which they prefer to shop or browse for such products. In general, changes in consumption in our product categories or consumer demographics could result in reduced demand for our products. Demand for our products depends in part on our ability to anticipate and effectively respond to shifts in consumer trends and preferences, including increased demand for products that meet the needs of consumers who are concerned with: health and wellness (including products that have less added sugars, sodium and saturated fat); convenience (including responding to changes in in-home and on-the-go consumption patterns and methods of distribution of our products to customers and consumers); or the location of origin or source of the ingredients and products (including the environmental impact related to the production of our products). Consumer preferences have been evolving, and are expected to continue to evolve, due to a variety of factors, including: changes in consumer demographics, including the aging of the general population and the emergence of the millennial and younger generations who have differing spending and consumption habits; consumer concerns or perceptions regarding the nutrition profile of certain of our products, including the presence of added sugar, sodium and saturated fat in certain of our products; growing demand for organic or locally sourced ingredients, or consumer concerns or perceptions (whether or not valid) regarding the health effects of ingredients or substances present in certain of our products, such as 4-MeI, acrylamide, artificial flavors and colors, artificial sweeteners, aspartame, caffeine, furfuryl alcohol, high-fructose corn syrup, partially hydrolyzed oils, saturated fat, sodium, sugar, trans fats or other product ingredients, substances or attributes, including genetically engineered ingredients; taxes or other restrictions, including labeling requirements, imposed on our products; consumer concerns or perceptions regarding packaging materials, including their environmental impact; changes in package or portion size; changes in social trends that impact travel, vacation or leisure activity patterns; changes in weather patterns or seasonal consumption cycles; the continued acceleration of e-commerce and other methods of purchasing products; negative publicity (whether or not valid) resulting from regulatory actions, litigation against us or other companies in our industry or negative or inaccurate posts or comments in the media, including social media, about us, our employees, our products or advertising campaigns and marketing programs; perception of social media posts or other information disseminated by us or our employees and agents, customers, suppliers, bottlers, distributors, joint venture partners or other third parties; perception of our employees, agents, customers, suppliers, bottlers, distributors, joint venture partners or other third parties or the business practices of such parties; product boycotts; or a downturn in economic conditions. Any of these factors may reduce consumers' willingness to purchase our products and any inability on our part to anticipate or react to such changes could result in reduced demand for our products and erosion of our competitive and financial position and could adversely affect our business, reputation, financial condition or results of operations. Demand for our products is also dependent in part on product quality, product and marketing innovation and production and distribution, including our ability to: maintain a robust pipeline of new products; improve the quality of existing products; extend our portfolio of products in growing markets and categories; respond to cultural differences and regional consumer preferences (whether through developing or acquiring new products that are responsive to such preferences); monitor and adjust our use of ingredients (including to respond to applicable regulations); develop or acquire a broader portfolio of product choices, including by continuing to increase non-carbonated beverage offerings and other alternatives to traditional carbonated beverage offerings and, in some cases, reformulations of our traditional carbonated beverage offerings; develop sweetener alternatives and innovation; improve the production, packaging and distribution of our 11 Table of Contents products; respond to competitive product and pricing pressures and changes in distribution channels, including in the rapidly growing e-commerce channel; and implement effective advertising campaigns and marketing programs, including successfully adapting to a rapidly changing media environment through the use of social media and online advertising campaigns and marketing programs. Although we devote significant resources to the items mentioned above, there can be no assurance as to our continued ability to develop, launch, maintain or distribute successful new products or variants of existing products in a timely manner (including to correctly anticipate or effectively react to changes in consumer preferences) or to develop and effectively execute advertising and marketing campaigns that appeal to customers and consumers. Our failure to make the right strategic investments to drive innovation or successfully launch new products or variants of existing products or effectively distribute our products could decrease demand for our existing products by negatively affecting consumer perception of our existing brands and may result in inventory write-offs and other costs that could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. Changes in, or failure to comply with, laws and regulations applicable to our products or our business operations could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. The conduct of our business is subject to various laws and regulations administered by federal, state and local governmental agencies in the United States, as well as government entities and agencies outside the United States, including laws and regulations relating to the production, storage, distribution, sale, display, advertising, marketing, labeling, content, quality, safety, transportation, disposal, recycling and use of our products, as well as our employment and occupational health and safety practices and protection of personal information. In addition, in many jurisdictions, compliance with competition laws is of special importance to us due to our competitive position in those jurisdictions, as is compliance with anti-corruption laws. Many of these laws and regulations have differing or conflicting legal standards across the various markets where our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold and, in certain markets, such as developing and emerging markets, may be less developed or certain. For example, products containing genetically engineered ingredients are subject to varying regulations and restrictions in the jurisdictions in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold. In addition, these laws and regulations and related interpretations may change, sometimes dramatically and unexpectedly, as a result of a variety of factors, including political, economic or social events. Such changes may include changes in: food and drug laws; laws related to product labeling, advertising and marketing practices; laws and treaties related to international trade, including laws regarding the import or export of our products or ingredients used in our products and tariffs; laws and programs restricting the sale and advertising of certain of our products, including restrictions on the audience to whom products are marketed; laws and programs aimed at reducing, restricting or eliminating ingredients or substances in, or attributes of, certain of our products; laws and programs aimed at discouraging the consumption or altering the package or portion size of certain of our products, including laws imposing restrictions on the use of government funds or programs, such as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (included within the Farm Bill in the United States), to purchase certain of our products; increased regulatory scrutiny of, and increased litigation involving product claims and concerns (whether or not valid) regarding the effects on health of ingredients or substances in, or attributes of, certain of our products, including without limitation those found in energy drinks; state consumer protection laws; laws regulating the protection of personal information; cyber-security regulations; regulatory initiatives, including the imposition or proposed imposition of new or increased taxes or other measures impacting the manufacture, distribution or sale of our products; accounting rules and interpretations; employment laws; privacy laws; laws regulating the price we may charge for our products; laws regulating water rights and access to and use of water or utilities; environmental laws, including laws relating to the regulation of water treatment and discharge of wastewater and air emissions and laws relating to the disposal, recovery or recycling of our products and their packaging. Changes in regulatory requirements, and competing regulations and standards, where our 12 Table of Contents products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold, may result in higher compliance costs, capital expenditures and higher production costs, which could adversely affect our business, reputation, financial condition or results of operations. The imposition by any jurisdiction in the United States or outside the United States of new laws, regulations or governmental policy and their related interpretations, or changes in any of the foregoing, including taxes, labeling, product or production requirements or other limitations on, or pertaining to, the sale or advertisement of certain of our products, ingredients or substances contained in, or attributes of, our products or commodities used in the production of our products, may further alter the way in which we do business and, therefore, may continue to increase our costs or liabilities or reduce demand for our products, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. If one jurisdiction imposes or proposes to impose new requirements or restrictions, other jurisdictions may follow and the requirements or restrictions, or proposed requirements or restrictions, may also result in adverse publicity (whether or not valid). For example, if one jurisdiction imposes a tax on sugar-sweetened beverages or foods, or imposes a specific labeling or warning requirement, other jurisdictions may impose similar or other measures that impact the manufacture, distribution or sale of our products. The foregoing may result in decreased demand for our products, adverse publicity or increased concerns about the health implications of consumption of ingredients or substances in our products (whether or not valid). In addition, studies (whether or not scientifically valid) are underway by third parties purporting to assess the health implications of consumption of certain ingredients or substances present in certain of our products, such as 4-MeI, acrylamide, caffeine, furfuryl alcohol, added sugars, sodium and saturated fat. Third parties have also published documents or studies claiming (whether or not valid) that taxes can address consumer consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages and other foods high in sugar, sodium or saturated fat. If, as a result of these studies and documents or otherwise, there is an increase in consumer concerns (whether or not valid) about the health implications of consumption of our products, an increase in the number of jurisdictions that impose taxes on our products, or an increase in new labeling, product or production requirements or other restrictions on the manufacturing, sale or display of our products, demand for our products could decline, or we could be subject to lawsuits or new regulations that could affect sales of our products, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. Although we have policies and procedures in place that are designed to promote legal and regulatory compliance, our employees, suppliers, or other third parties with whom we do business could take actions, intentional or not, that violate these policies and procedures or applicable laws or regulations or could fail to maintain required documentation sufficient to evidence our compliance with applicable laws or regulations. Violations of laws or regulations could subject us to criminal or civil enforcement actions, including fines, penalties, disgorgement of profits or activity restrictions, any of which could result in adverse publicity or affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, regulatory authorities under whose laws we operate may have enforcement powers that can subject us to actions such as product recall, seizure of products or assets or other sanctions, which could have an adverse effect on the sales of products in our portfolio or could lead to damage to our reputation. In addition, we and our subsidiaries are party to a variety of legal and environmental remediation obligations arising in the normal course of business, as well as environmental remediation, product liability, toxic tort and related indemnification proceedings in connection with certain historical activities and contractual obligations, including those of businesses acquired by us or our subsidiaries. Due to regulatory complexities, uncertainties inherent in litigation and the risk of unidentified contaminants on current and former properties of ours and our subsidiaries, the potential exists for remediation, liability and indemnification costs to differ materially from the costs we have estimated. We cannot guarantee that our costs in relation to these matters 13 Table of Contents will not exceed our estimates or otherwise have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. The imposition or proposed imposition of new or increased taxes aimed at our products could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. Certain jurisdictions in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold have either imposed, or are considering imposing, new or increased taxes on the manufacture, distribution or sale of our products, ingredients or substances contained in, or attributes of, our products or commodities used in the production of our products. These taxes vary in scope and form: some apply to all beverages, including non-caloric beverages, while others apply only to beverages with a caloric sweetener (e.g., sugar). Similarly, some measures apply a single tax rate per liquid ounce while others apply a graduated tax rate depending upon the amount of added sugar in the beverage and some apply a flat tax rate on beverages containing a particular substance or ingredient. For example, effective January 2018, the City of Seattle, Washington in the United States enacted a per-ounce surcharge on all sugar-sweetened beverages. By contrast, the United Kingdom enacted a graduated tax, effective April 2018, in which the per-ounce tax rate is tied to the amount of added sugar present in the beverage: the higher the amount of added sugar, the higher the per-ounce tax rate and Saudi Arabia enacted, effective June 2017, a flat tax rate of 50% on the retail price of carbonated soft drinks. These tax measures, whatever their scope or form, could increase the cost of our products, reduce overall consumption of our products, lead to negative publicity (whether based on scientific fact or not) or leave consumers with the perception (whether or not valid) that our products do not meet their health and wellness needs. Such factors could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. Significant additional labeling or warning requirements or limitations on the marketing or sale of our products may reduce demand for such products and could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. Certain jurisdictions in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold have either imposed, or are considering imposing, product labeling or warning requirements or limitations on the marketing or sale of certain of our products as a result of ingredients or substances contained in such products. These types of provisions have required that we provide a label that highlights perceived concerns about a product or warns consumers to avoid consumption of certain ingredients or substances present in our products. For example, in California in the United States, Proposition 65 requires a specific warning on or relating to any product that contains a substance listed by the State of California as having been found to cause cancer or birth defects or other reproductive harm, unless the level of such substance in the product is below a safe harbor level established by the State of California. In addition, a number of jurisdictions, both in and outside the United States, have imposed or are considering imposing labeling requirements, including color-coded labeling of certain food and beverage products where colors such as red, yellow and green are used to indicate various levels of a particular ingredient, such as sugar, sodium or saturated fat. The imposition or proposed imposition of additional product labeling or warning requirements could reduce overall consumption of our products, lead to negative publicity (whether based on scientific fact or not) or leave consumers with the perception (whether or not valid) that our products do not meet their health and wellness needs. Such factors could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. Changes in laws and regulations relating to packaging or disposal of our products could continue to increase our costs and reduce demand for our products or otherwise have an adverse impact on our business, reputation, financial condition or results of operations. Certain of our products are sold in packaging designed to be recoverable for recycling but not all packaging 14 Table of Contents is recovered, whether due to low value, lack of infrastructure or otherwise. The United States and many other jurisdictions have imposed or are considering imposing regulations or policies designed to encourage recycling, including requiring that deposits or certain taxes or fees be charged in connection with the sale, distribution, marketing and use of certain packaging; extended producer responsibility policies which makes brand owners responsible for the costs of recycling products after consumers have used them; and adopting or extending product stewardship policies which could require brand owners to plan for and, if necessary, pay for the recycling or disposal of packaging after consumers have used them. In addition, these jurisdictions may elect to impose regulations or policies to ban the use of certain packaging, such as plastic beverage bottles. Compliance with these laws and regulations could continue to affect our costs or require changes in our distribution model, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. Further, our reputation could be damaged if we or others in our industry do not act, or are perceived not to act, responsibly with respect to packaging or disposal of our products. Our business, financial condition or results of operations could suffer if we are unable to compete effectively. Our beverage, food and snack products are in highly competitive categories and markets and compete against products of international beverage, food and snack companies that, like us, operate in multiple geographies, as well as regional, local, and private label manufacturers, economy brands and other competitors. In many countries in which our products are sold, including the United States, The Coca-Cola Company is our primary beverage competitor. Other beverage, food and snack competitors include, but are not limited to, DPSG, Kellogg Company, The Kraft Heinz Company, Mondelez International, Inc., Monster Beverage Corporation, Nestlé S.A., Red Bull GmbH and Snyder's-Lance, Inc. Our beverage, food and snack products compete primarily on the basis of brand recognition and loyalty, taste, price, value, quality, product variety, innovation, distribution, advertising, marketing and promotional activity, packaging, convenience, service and the ability to anticipate and effectively respond to consumer preferences and trends, including increased consumer focus on health and wellness and the continued acceleration of e-commerce and other methods of distributing and purchasing products. If we are unable to effectively promote our existing products or introduce new products, if our advertising or marketing campaigns are not effective or if we are otherwise unable to effectively respond to pricing pressure or compete effectively (including in distributing our products effectively and cost efficiently through all existing and emerging channels of trade, including through e-commerce and hard discounters), we may be unable to grow or maintain sales or category share or we may need to increase capital, marketing or other expenditures, which may adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. Our business, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected as a result of political conditions in the markets in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold. Political conditions in the markets in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold may be difficult to predict and may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. The results of elections, referendums or other political conditions in the markets in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold could create uncertainty regarding how existing laws and regulations may change, including with respect to sanctions, climate change regulation, taxes, the movement of goods, services and people between countries and other matters, and could result in exchange rate fluctuation, volatility in global stock markets and global economic uncertainty. For example, there is continued uncertainty surrounding the United Kingdom's pending withdrawal from the European Union, including how the United Kingdom will interact with other European Union countries following its departure. Any changes in, or the imposition of new laws, regulations or governmental policy and their related interpretations due to elections, 15 Table of Contents referendums or other political conditions could have an adverse impact on our business, financial conditions and results of operations. Our business, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected if we are unable to grow our business in developing and emerging markets. Our success depends in part on our ability to grow our business in developing and emerging markets, including Mexico, Russia, the Middle East, Brazil, China and India. However, there can be no assurance that our existing products, variants of our existing products or new products that we make, manufacture, distribute or sell will be accepted or be successful in any particular developing or emerging market, due to local or global competition, product price, cultural differences, consumer preferences or otherwise. The following factors could reduce demand for our products or otherwise impede the growth of our business in developing and emerging markets: unstable economic, political or social conditions; acts of war, terrorist acts, and civil unrest; increased competition; volatility in the economic growth of certain of these markets and the related impact on developed countries who export to these markets; volatile oil prices and the impact on the local economy in certain of these markets; our inability to acquire businesses, form strategic business alliances or to make necessary infrastructure investments; our inability to complete divestitures or refranchisings; imposition of new or increased labeling, product or production requirements, or other restrictions; imposition of new or increased sanctions against, or other regulations restricting contact with, certain countries in these markets, or imposition of new or increased sanctions against U.S. multinational corporations operating in these markets; actions, such as removing our products from shelves, taken by retailers in response to U.S. trade sanctions or other governmental action or policy; foreign ownership restrictions; nationalization of our assets or the assets of our suppliers, bottlers, distributors, joint venture partners or other third parties; imposition of taxes on our products or the ingredients or substances used in our products; government-mandated closure, or threatened closure, of our operations or the operations of our suppliers, bottlers, distributors, joint venture partners, customers or other third parties; restrictions on the import or export of our products or ingredients or substances used in our products; regulations relating to the repatriation of funds currently held in foreign jurisdictions to the United States; highly-inflationary economies, devaluation or fluctuation, such as the devaluation of the Egyptian pound, Turkish lira, Pound sterling, Argentine peso and the Mexican peso, or demonetization of currency; regulations on the transfer of funds to and from foreign countries, currency controls or other currency exchange restrictions, which result in significant cash balances in foreign countries, from time to time, or could significantly affect our ability to effectively manage our operations in certain of these markets and could result in the deconsolidation of such businesses; the lack of well-established or reliable legal systems; increased costs of doing business due to compliance with complex foreign and U.S. laws and regulations that apply to our international operations, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act and the Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act; and adverse consequences, such as the assessment of fines or penalties, for any failure to comply with these laws and regulations. If we are unable to expand our businesses in developing and emerging markets, effectively operate, or manage the risks associated with operating, in these markets, or achieve the return on capital we expect from our investments in these markets, our reputation, business, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected. Uncertain or unfavorable economic conditions may have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Many of the countries in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed and sold have experienced and may, from time to time, continue to experience uncertain or unfavorable economic conditions, such as recessions or economic slowdowns. Our business or financial results may be adversely impacted by uncertain or unfavorable economic conditions in the United States and globally, including: adverse changes in interest rates, tax laws or tax rates; volatile commodity markets, including speculative influences; highly-inflationary 16 Table of Contents economies, devaluation, fluctuation or demonetization; contraction in the availability of credit in the marketplace due to legislation or economic conditions; the effects of government initiatives, including demonetization, austerity or stimulus measures to manage economic conditions and any changes to or cessation of such initiatives; the effects of any default by or deterioration in the creditworthiness of the countries in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold or of countries that may then impact countries in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold; reduced demand for our products resulting from volatility in general global economic conditions or a shift in consumer preferences for economic reasons or otherwise to regional, local or private label products or other lower-cost products, or to less profitable sales channels; or a decrease in the fair value of pension or post-retirement assets that could increase future employee benefit costs and/or funding requirements of our pension or post-retirement plans. In addition, we cannot predict how current or future economic conditions will affect our customers, consumers, suppliers, bottlers, distributors, joint venture partners or other third parties and any negative impact on any of the foregoing may also have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, some of the major financial institutions with which we execute transactions, including U.S. and non-U.S. commercial banks, insurance companies, investment banks and other financial institutions, may be exposed to a ratings downgrade, bankruptcy, liquidity events, default or similar risks as a result of unfavorable economic conditions, changing regulatory requirements or other factors beyond our control. A ratings downgrade, bankruptcy, receivership, default or similar event involving a major financial institution, or changes in the regulatory environment, may limit the ability or willingness of financial institutions to enter into financial transactions with us, including to provide banking or related cash management services, or to extend credit on terms commercially acceptable to us or at all; may leave us with reduced borrowing capacity or exposed to certain currencies or price risk associated with forecasted purchases of raw materials, including through our use of fixed-price contracts and purchase orders, pricing agreements and derivative instruments, including swaps and futures; or may result in a decline in the market value of our investments in debt securities, which could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Similar risks exist with respect to our customers, suppliers, bottlers, distributors and joint venture partners and could result in their inability to obtain credit to purchase our products or to finance the manufacture and distribution of our products resulting in canceled orders and/or product delays, which could also have an adverse impact on our reputation, business, financial condition or results of operations. Our business and reputation could suffer if we are unable to protect our information systems against, or effectively respond to, cyberattacks or other cyber incidents or if our information systems, or those of our customers, suppliers, bottlers, contract manufacturers, distributors, joint venture partners or other third parties, are otherwise disrupted. We depend on information systems and technology, some of which are provided by third parties, including public websites and cloud-based services, for many activities important to our business, including: to interface with our customers and consumers; to engage in marketing activities; to enable and improve the effectiveness of our operations; to order and manage materials from suppliers; to manage inventory; to manage our facilities; to conduct research and development; to maintain accurate financial records; to achieve operational efficiencies; to comply with regulatory, financial reporting, legal and tax requirements; to collect and store sensitive data and confidential information; to communicate electronically among our global operations and with our employees and the employees of our customers, suppliers, bottlers, contract manufacturers, distributors, joint venture partners and other third parties; and to communicate with our investors. As with other global companies, we are regularly subject to cyberattacks. Cyberattacks and other cyber incidents are occurring more frequently, are constantly evolving in nature, are becoming more sophisticated and are being made by groups and individuals (including criminal hackers, hacktivists, state-sponsored 17 Table of Contents institutions, terrorist organizations and individuals or groups participating in organized crime) with a wide range of expertise and motives (including monetization of corporate, payment or other internal or personal data, theft of trade secrets and intellectual property for competitive advantage and leverage for political, social, economic and environmental reasons). Such cyberattacks and cyber incidents can take many forms including cyber extortion, denial of service, social engineering, such as impersonation attempts to fraudulently induce employees or others to disclose information or unwittingly provide access to systems or data, introduction of viruses or malware, such as ransomware through phishing emails, website defacement or theft of passwords and other credentials. Although we may incur significant costs in protecting against or remediating cyberattacks or other cyber incidents, no cyberattack or other cyber incident has, to our knowledge, had a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations to date. If we do not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build and maintain our information technology infrastructure, including monitoring networks and systems, upgrading our security policies and the skills and training of our employees, and requiring our third-party service providers, customers, suppliers, bottlers, contract manufacturers, distributors, joint venture partners or other third parties to do the same, if we or they fail to timely identify or appropriately respond to cyberattacks or other cyber incidents, or if our or their information systems are damaged, compromised, destroyed or shut down (whether as a result of natural disasters, fires, power outages, acts of terrorism or other catastrophic events, network outages, software, equipment or telecommunications failures, technology development defects, user errors, or from deliberate cyberattacks such as malicious or disruptive software, denial of service attacks, malicious social engineering, hackers or otherwise), our business could be disrupted and we could, among other things, be subject to: transaction errors; processing inefficiencies; the loss of, or failure to attract, new customers and consumers; lost revenues resulting from the disruption or shutdown of computer systems or other information technology systems at our offices, plants, warehouses, distribution centers or other facilities, or the loss of a competitive advantage due to the unauthorized use, acquisition or disclosure of, or access to, confidential information; the incurrence of costs to restore data and to safeguard against future extortion attempts; the loss of, or damage to, intellectual property or trade secrets, including the loss or unauthorized disclosure of sensitive data or other assets; alteration, corruption or loss of accounting, financial or other data on which we rely for financial reporting and other purposes, which could cause delays in our financial reporting; damage to our reputation or brands; damage to employee, customer and consumer relations; litigation; regulatory enforcement actions or fines; unauthorized disclosure of confidential personal information of our employees, customers or consumers; the loss of information and/or supply chain disruption resulting from the failure of security patches to be developed and installed on a timely basis; violation of data privacy, security or other laws and regulations; and remediation costs. Further, our information systems and the information stored therein could be compromised by, and we could experience similar adverse consequences due to, unauthorized outside parties accessing or extracting sensitive data or confidential information, corrupting information or disrupting business processes (or demonstrating an ability to do so) or by inadvertent or intentional actions by our employees, agents or third parties. We continue to devote significant resources to network security, backup and disaster recovery, and other security measures, including training, to protect our systems and data, but these security measures cannot provide absolute security or guarantee that we will be successful in preventing or responding to every such breach or disruption. In addition, due to the constantly evolving nature of these security threats, the form and impact of any future incident cannot be predicted. Similar risks exist with respect to the cloud-based service providers and other third-party vendors that we rely upon for aspects of our information technology support services and administrative functions, including payroll processing, health and benefit plan administration and certain finance and accounting functions, and systems managed, hosted, provided and/or used by third parties and their vendors. The need to coordinate with various third-party vendors may complicate our efforts to resolve any issues that may arise. As a result, 18 Table of Contents we are subject to the risk that the activities associated with our third-party vendors may adversely affect our business even if the attack or breach does not directly impact our systems or information. Moreover, our increased use of mobile and cloud technologies could heighten these and other operational risks, as certain aspects of the security of such technologies may be complex, unpredictable or beyond our control. While we currently maintain insurance coverage that, subject to its terms and conditions, is intended to address costs associated with certain aspects of cyber incidents, network failures and data privacy-related concerns, this insurance coverage may not, depending on the specific facts and circumstances surrounding an incident, cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise from an incident, or the damage to our reputation or brands that may result from an incident. Our business, financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected by increased costs, disruption of supply or shortages of raw materials, energy, water and other supplies. We and our business partners use various raw materials, energy, water and other supplies in our business. The principal ingredients we use in our beverage, food and snack products are apple, orange and pineapple juice and other juice concentrates, aspartame, corn, corn sweeteners, flavorings, flour, grapefruit, oranges and other fruits, oats, potatoes, raw milk, rice, seasonings, sucralose, sugar, vegetable and essential oils, and wheat. We also use water in the manufacturing of our products. Our key packaging materials include plastic resins, including PET and polypropylene resins used for plastic beverage bottles and film packaging used for snack foods, aluminum used for cans, glass bottles, closures, cardboard and paperboard cartons. Fuel, electricity and natural gas are also important commodities for our businesses due to their use in our and our business partners' facilities and the vehicles delivering our products. Some of these raw materials and supplies are sourced from countries experiencing civil unrest, political instability or unfavorable economic conditions, and some are available from a limited number of suppliers or a sole supplier or are in short supply when seasonal demand is at its peak. We cannot assure that we will be able to maintain favorable arrangements and relationships with these suppliers or that our contingency plans, including development of ingredients, materials or supplies to replace ingredients, materials or supplies sourced from such suppliers, will be effective in preventing disruptions that may arise from shortages or discontinuation of any ingredient that is sourced from such suppliers. In addition, increasing focus on climate change, deforestation, water, animal welfare and human rights concerns and other risks associated with the global food system may lead to increased activism focusing on consumer goods companies, governmental intervention and consumer response, and could adversely affect our or our suppliers' reputation and business and our ability to procure the materials we need to operate our business. The raw materials and energy, including fuel, that we use for the manufacturing, production and distribution of our products are largely commodities that are subject to price volatility and fluctuations in availability caused by many factors, including changes in global supply and demand, weather conditions (including any potential effects of climate change), fire, natural disasters (such as a hurricane, tornado, earthquake or flooding), disease or pests, agricultural uncertainty, health epidemics or pandemics, governmental incentives and controls (including import/export restrictions), political uncertainties, acts of terrorism, governmental instability or currency exchange rates. Shortage of some of these raw materials and other supplies, sustained interruption in their supply or an increase in their costs could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. Many of our ingredients, raw materials and commodities are purchased in the open market. The prices we pay for such items are subject to fluctuation, and we manage this risk through the use of fixed-price contracts and purchase orders, pricing agreements and derivative instruments, including swaps and futures. If commodity price changes result in unexpected or significant increases in raw materials and energy costs, we may be unwilling or unable to increase our product prices or unable to effectively hedge against commodity price increases to offset these increased costs without suffering reduced volume, revenue, margins and operating results. In addition, certain of the derivatives used to hedge price risk do not qualify for hedge 19 Table of Contents accounting treatment and, therefore, can result in increased volatility in our net earnings in any given period due to changes in the spot prices of the underlying commodities. Water is a limited resource in many parts of the world. The lack of available water of acceptable quality and increasing pressure to conserve water in areas of scarcity and stress may lead to: supply chain disruption; adverse effects on our operations; higher compliance costs; capital expenditures (including additional investments in the development of technologies to enhance water efficiency and reduce water consumption); higher production costs; the cessation of operations at, or relocation of, our facilities or the facilities of our suppliers, bottlers, contract manufacturers, distributors, joint venture partners or other third parties; or damage to our reputation, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. Business disruptions could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Our ability, and that of our suppliers and other third parties, including our bottlers, contract manufacturers, joint venture partners, distributors and customers, to make, manufacture, transport, distribute and sell products in our portfolio is critical to our success. Damage or disruption to our or their operations due to any of the following factors could impair the ability to make, manufacture, transport, distribute or sell products in our portfolio: adverse weather conditions (including any potential effects of climate change) or natural disasters, such as a hurricane, tornado, earthquake or flooding; government action; economic or political uncertainties or instability in countries in which such products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold, which may also affect our ability to protect the security of our assets and employees; fire; terrorism; outbreak or escalation of armed hostilities; food safety warnings or recalls, whether related to products in our portfolio or otherwise; health epidemics or pandemics; supply and commodity shortages; unplanned delays or unexpected problems associated with repairs or enhancements of facilities in which such products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold; loss or impairment of key manufacturing sites; cyber incidents, including the disruption or shutdown of computer systems or other information technology systems at our offices, plants, warehouses, distribution centers or other facilities or those of our suppliers and other third parties who make, manufacture, transport, distribute and sell products in our portfolio; industrial accidents or other occupational health and safety issues; telecommunications failures; power or water shortages; strikes and other labor disputes; or other reasons beyond our control or the control of our suppliers and other third parties. Failure to take adequate steps to mitigate the likelihood or potential impact of such events, or to effectively manage such events if they occur, could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations, as well as require additional resources to restore operations. Product contamination or tampering or issues or concerns with respect to product quality, safety and integrity could adversely affect our business, reputation, financial condition or results of operations. Product contamination or tampering, the failure to maintain high standards for product quality, safety and integrity, including with respect to raw materials and ingredients obtained from suppliers, or allegations (whether or not valid) of product quality issues, mislabeling, misbranding, spoilage, allergens, adulteration or contamination with respect to products in our portfolio may reduce demand for such products, and cause production and delivery disruptions or increase costs, which could adversely affect our business, reputation, financial condition or results of operations. If any of the products in our portfolio are mislabeled or become unfit for consumption or cause injury, illness or death, or if appropriate resources are not devoted to product quality and safety (particularly as we expand our portfolio into new categories) or to comply with changing food safety requirements, we could decide to, or be required to, recall products in our portfolio and/or we may be subject to liability or government action, which could result in payment of damages or fines, cause certain products in our portfolio to be unavailable for a period of time, result in destruction of product inventory, or result in adverse publicity (whether or not valid), which could reduce consumer demand and 20 Table of Contents brand equity. Moreover, even if allegations of product contamination or tampering or suggestions that our products were not fit for consumption are meritless, the negative publicity surrounding assertions against us or products in our portfolio or processes could adversely affect our reputation or brands. Our business could also be adversely affected if consumers lose confidence in product quality, safety and integrity generally, even if such loss of confidence is unrelated to products in our portfolio. Any of the foregoing could adversely affect our business, reputation, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, if we do not have adequate insurance, if we do not have enforceable indemnification from suppliers, bottlers, contract manufacturers, distributors, joint venture partners or other third parties or if indemnification is not available, the liability relating to such product claims or disruption as a result of recall efforts could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. Any damage to our reputation or brand image could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. We are a leading global beverage, food and snack company with brands that are respected household names throughout the world. Maintaining a good reputation globally is critical to selling our branded products. Our reputation or brand image could be adversely impacted by any of the following, or by adverse publicity (whether or not valid) relating thereto: the failure to maintain high ethical, social and environmental practices for all of our operations and activities, including with respect to human rights, child labor laws and workplace conditions and safety, or failure to require our suppliers or other third parties to do so; the failure to achieve our goals of reducing added sugars, sodium and saturated fat in certain of our products and of growing our portfolio of product choices; the failure to achieve our other sustainability goals or to be perceived as appropriately addressing matters of social responsibility; the failure to protect our intellectual property, including in the event our brands are used without our authorization; health concerns (whether or not valid) about our products or particular ingredients or substances in, or attributes of, our products, including concerns regarding whether certain of our products contribute to obesity; the imposition or proposed imposition of new or increased taxes, labeling requirements or other limitations on, or pertaining to, the sale, display or advertising of our products; any failure to comply, or perception of a failure to comply, with our policies and goals, including those regarding advertising to children and reducing calorie consumption from sugar-sweetened beverages; our research and development efforts; the recall (voluntary or otherwise) of any products in our portfolio; our environmental impact, including use of agricultural materials, packaging, water, energy use and waste management; any failure to achieve our goals with respect to reducing our impact on the environment, or perception of a failure to act responsibly with respect to water use and the environment; any failure to achieve our goals with respect to human rights throughout our value chain; the practices of our employees, agents, customers, distributors, suppliers, bottlers, contract manufacturers, joint venture partners or other third parties (including others in our industry) with respect to any of the foregoing, actual or perceived; consumer perception of our industry; consumer perception of our advertising campaigns, sponsorship arrangements or marketing programs; consumer perception of our use of social media; consumer perception of statements made by us, our employees and executives, agents, customers, suppliers, bottlers, distributors, joint venture partners or other third parties (including others in our industry); or our responses or the responses of others in our industry to any of the foregoing. In addition, we operate globally, which requires us to comply with numerous local regulations, including, without limitation, anti-corruption laws, competition laws and tax laws and regulations of the jurisdictions in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold. In the event that we or our employees engage in or are believed to have engaged in improper activities, we may be subject to regulatory proceedings, including enforcement actions, litigation, loss of sales or other consequences, which may cause us to suffer damage to our reputation in the United States or abroad. Failure to comply with local laws and regulations, to maintain an effective system of internal control or to provide accurate and timely financial information could also hurt our reputation. In addition, water is a limited resource in many parts of the world and demand 21 Table of Contents for water continues to rise. Our reputation could be damaged if we or others in our industry do not act, or are perceived not to act, responsibly with respect to water use. Further, the popularity of social media and other consumer-oriented technologies has increased the speed and accessibility of information dissemination. As a result, negative or inaccurate posts or comments about us, our products, policies, practices, advertising campaigns and marketing programs or sponsorship arrangements; our use of social media or of posts or other information disseminated by us or our employees, agents, customers, suppliers, bottlers, distributors, joint venture partners or other third parties; consumer perception of any of the foregoing, or failure by us to respond effectively to any of the foregoing, may also generate adverse publicity (whether or not valid) that could damage our reputation. Damage to our reputation or brand image or loss of consumer confidence in our products or employees for any of these or other reasons could result in decreased demand for our products and could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations, as well as require additional resources to rebuild our reputation. Failure to successfully complete or integrate acquisitions and joint ventures into our existing operations, or to complete or effectively manage divestitures or refranchisings, could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. We regularly review our portfolio of businesses and evaluate potential acquisitions, joint ventures, divestitures, refranchisings and other strategic transactions. Potential issues associated with these activities could include, among other things: our ability to realize the full extent of the expected returns, benefits, cost savings or synergies as a result of a transaction, within the anticipated time frame, or at all; receipt of necessary consents, clearances and approvals in connection with a transaction; and diversion of management's attention from day-to-day operations. With respect to acquisitions, the following factors also pose potential risks: our ability to successfully combine our businesses with the business of the acquired company, including integrating the acquired company's manufacturing, distribution, sales, accounting, financial reporting and administrative support activities and information technology systems with our company; our ability to successfully operate in new categories or territories; motivating, recruiting and retaining executives and key employees; conforming standards, controls (including internal control over financial reporting, environmental compliance, health and safety compliance and compliance with other laws and regulations), procedures and policies, business cultures and compensation structures between us and the acquired company; consolidating and streamlining corporate and administrative infrastructures and avoiding increased operating expenses; consolidating sales and marketing operations; retaining existing customers and attracting new customers; retaining existing distributors; identifying and eliminating redundant and underperforming operations and assets; coordinating geographically dispersed organizations; managing tax costs or inefficiencies associated with integrating our operations following completion of an acquisition; and other unanticipated problems or liabilities, such as contingent liabilities and litigation. With respect to joint ventures, we share ownership and management responsibility with one or more parties who may or may not have the same goals, strategies, priorities, resources or values as we do. Joint ventures are intended to be operated for the benefit of all co-owners, rather than for our exclusive benefit. Business decisions or other actions or omissions of our joint venture partners may adversely affect the value of our investment, result in litigation or regulatory action against us or otherwise damage our reputation and brands and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, acquisitions and joint ventures outside of the United States increase our exposure to risks associated with operations outside of the United States, including fluctuations in exchange rates and 22 Table of Contents compliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws and laws and regulations outside the United States. With respect to divestitures and refranchisings, we may not be able to complete or effectively manage such transactions on terms commercially favorable to us or at all and may fail to achieve the anticipated benefits or cost savings from the divestiture or refranchising. Further, as divestitures and refranchisings may reduce our direct control over certain aspects of our business, any failure to maintain good relations with divested or refranchised businesses in our supply or sales chain may adversely impact our sales or business performance. If an acquisition or joint venture is not successfully completed or integrated into our existing operations, or if a divestiture or refranchising is not successfully completed or managed or does not result in the benefits or cost savings we expect, our business, financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected. A change in our estimates and underlying assumptions regarding the future performance of our businesses could result in an impairment charge, which could materially affect our results of operations. We conduct impairment tests on our goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets, as well as other investments and other long-lived assets annually, during our third quarter, or more frequently, if circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable or that an other-than-temporary impairment exists. Any changes in our estimates or underlying assumptions regarding the future performance of our reporting units or in determining the fair value of any such reporting unit, including goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets, as well as other investments and other long-lived assets, could adversely affect our results of operations. Factors that could result in an impairment include, but are not limited to: significant negative economic or industry trends or competitive operating conditions; significant macroeconomic conditions that may result in a future increase in the weighted-average cost of capital used to estimate fair value; and significant changes in the nature and timing of decisions regarding assets or markets that do not perform consistent with our expectations, including factors we use to estimate future levels of sales, operating profit or cash flows. Future impairment charges could have a significant adverse effect on our results of operations in the periods recognized. Increases in income tax rates, changes in income tax laws or disagreements with tax authorities could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. We are subject to income taxes in the United States and in certain foreign jurisdictions in which we operate. Increases in income tax rates or other changes in income tax laws in any particular jurisdiction could reduce our after-tax income from such jurisdiction and could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. Our operations outside the United States generate a significant portion of our income. In addition, the United States and many of the other countries in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold, including countries in which we have significant operations, have recently made or are actively considering changes to existing tax laws. For example, on December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJ Act) was signed into law in the United States. The changes in the TCJ Act are broad and complex and we continue to examine the impact the TCJ Act may have on our business and financial results. Among its many provisions, the TCJ Act imposed a mandatory one-time transition tax on undistributed international earnings regardless of whether they are repatriated, reduced the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, imposed limitations on the deductibility of interest and certain other corporate deductions, and moved from a ""worldwide"" system of taxation that generally allows deferral of U.S. tax on international earnings until repatriated to a ""territorial""/dividend exemption system with a minimum tax that will subject international earnings to U.S. tax when earned. In accordance with applicable SEC guidance, we recorded a provisional net tax expense in the fourth quarter of 2017 resulting from the enactment of the TCJ Act. This provisional expense is subject to change, possibly materially, due to, among other things, changes in estimates, 23 Table of Contents interpretations and assumptions we have made, changes in Internal Revenue Service (IRS) interpretations, the issuance of new guidance, legislative actions, changes in accounting standards or related interpretations in response to the TCJ Act and future actions by states within the United States that have not currently adopted the TCJ Act. For further information regarding the potential impact of the TCJ Act, see ""Our Liquidity and Capital Resources"" and ""Our Critical Accounting Policies"" in Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements. Additional changes in the U.S. tax regime or in how U.S. multinational corporations are taxed on foreign earnings, including changes in how existing tax laws are interpreted or enforced, could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. We are also subject to regular reviews, examinations and audits by the IRS and other taxing authorities with respect to income and non-income based taxes both within and outside the United States. Economic and political pressures to increase tax revenues in jurisdictions in which we operate, or the adoption of new or reformed tax legislation or regulation, may make resolving tax disputes more difficult and the final resolution of tax audits and any related litigation could differ from our historical provisions and accruals, resulting in an adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, in connection with the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development Base Erosion and Profit Shifting project, companies are required to disclose more information to tax authorities on operations around the world, which may lead to greater audit scrutiny of profits earned in various countries. Failure to realize anticipated benefits from our productivity initiatives or global operating model could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Our future success and earnings growth depend, in part, on our ability to continue to reduce costs and improve efficiencies. Our productivity initiatives help support our growth initiatives and contribute to our results of operations. We continue to implement strategic plans that we believe will position our business for future success and long-term sustainable growth by allowing us to achieve a lower cost structure and operate more efficiently in the highly competitive beverage, food and snack categories and markets. We are also continuing to implement our global operating model to improve efficiency, decision making, innovation and brand management across the global PepsiCo organization to enable us to compete more effectively. Further, in order to continue to capitalize on our cost reduction efforts and our global operating model, it will be necessary to make certain investments in our business, which may be limited due to capital constraints. Some of these measures could yield unintended consequences, such as business disruptions, distraction of management and employees, reduced employee morale and productivity, and unexpected additional employee attrition, including the inability to attract or retain key personnel. It is critical that we have the appropriate personnel in place to continue to lead and execute our plans, including to effectively manage personnel adjustments and transitions resulting from these initiatives and increased competition for employees with the skills necessary to implement our plans. If we are unable to successfully implement our productivity initiatives and global operating model as planned, fail to implement these initiatives as timely as we anticipate, do not achieve expected savings as a result of these initiatives or incur higher than expected or unanticipated costs in implementing these initiatives, fail to identify and implement additional productivity opportunities in the future, or fail to successfully manage business disruptions or unexpected employee consequences on our workforce, morale or productivity, we may not realize all or any of the anticipated benefits, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. If we are unable to recruit, hire or retain key employees or a highly skilled and diverse workforce, it could have a negative impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Our continued growth requires us to recruit, hire, retain and develop our leadership bench and a highly skilled and diverse workforce. We compete to recruit and hire new employees and then must train them and develop 24 Table of Contents their skills and competencies. Our employees are highly sought after by our competitors and other companies and our continued ability to compete effectively depends on our ability to retain, develop and motivate highly skilled personnel for all areas of our organization. Any unplanned turnover or unsuccessful implementation of our succession plans to backfill current leadership positions, including the Chief Executive Officer, or to hire and retain a highly skilled and diverse workforce could deplete our institutional knowledge base and erode our competitive advantage or result in increased costs due to increased competition for employees, higher employee turnover or increased employee benefit costs. Any of the foregoing could adversely affect our reputation, business, financial condition or results of operations. The loss of, or a significant reduction in sales to, any key customer or disruption in the retail landscape, including rapid growth in hard discounters and the e-commerce channel, could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. Our customers include wholesale and other distributors, foodservice customers, grocery stores, drug stores, convenience stores, discount/dollar stores, mass merchandisers, membership stores, hard discounters, e-commerce retailers and authorized independent bottlers, among others. We must maintain mutually beneficial relationships with our key customers, including Wal-Mart, to compete effectively. Any inability to resolve a significant dispute with any of our key customers, a change in the business condition (financial or otherwise) of any of our key customers, even if unrelated to us, a significant reduction in sales to any key customer, or the loss of any of our key customers could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, our industry has been affected by changes to the retail landscape, including the rapid growth in sales through e-commerce websites and mobile commerce applications as well as the integration of physical and digital operations among retailers. We are making significant investments in attracting talent to and building our global e-commerce capabilities. Although we are engaged in e-commerce with respect to many of our products, if we are unable to maintain and develop successful relationships with existing and new e-commerce retailers or otherwise adapt to the growing e-commerce landscape, while simultaneously maintaining relationships with our key customers operating in traditional retail channels, we may be disadvantaged in certain channels and with certain customers and consumers, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, the growth in e-commerce may result in consumer price deflation, which may affect our relationships with key retail customers. If these e-commerce retailers were to take significant market share away from traditional retailers and/or we fail to adapt to the rapidly changing retail and e-commerce landscapes, our ability to maintain and grow our share of sales or volume and our business, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected. Further, the retail landscape continues to be impacted by the increased consolidation of retail ownership and purchasing power, particularly in North America, Europe and Latin America, resulting in large retailers with increased purchasing power, which may impact our ability to compete in these areas. Such retailers may demand improved efficiency, lower pricing and increased promotional programs. Further, should larger retailers increase utilization of their own distribution networks, other distribution channels such as e-commerce, or private label brands, the competitive advantages we derive from our go-to-market systems and brand equity may be eroded. In addition, the growth of hard discounters that are focused on limiting the number of items they sell and selling predominantly private label brands may reduce our ability to sell our products through such retailers. Failure to appropriately respond to any of the foregoing, including failure to offer effective sales incentives and marketing programs to our customers, could reduce our ability to secure adequate shelf space and product availability at our retailers, adversely affect our ability to maintain or grow our share of sales or volume, and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. 25 Table of Contents Our borrowing costs and access to capital and credit markets may be adversely affected by a downgrade or potential downgrade of our credit ratings. Rating agencies routinely evaluate us, and their ratings of our long-term and short-term debt are based on a number of factors, including our cash generating capability, levels of indebtedness, policies with respect to shareholder distributions and our financial strength generally, as well as factors beyond our control, such as the then-current state of the economy and our industry generally. Any downgrade of our credit ratings by a credit rating agency, especially any downgrade to below investment grade, whether as a result of our actions or factors which are beyond our control, could increase our future borrowing costs, impair our ability to access capital and credit markets on terms commercially acceptable to us or at all, and result in a reduction in our liquidity. We expect to maintain Tier 1 commercial paper access, which we believe will facilitate appropriate financial flexibility and ready access to global credit markets at favorable interest rates. However, any downgrade of our current short-term credit ratings could impair our ability to access the commercial paper market with the same flexibility that we have experienced historically, and therefore require us to rely more heavily on more expensive types of debt financing. Our borrowing costs and access to the commercial paper market could also be adversely affected if a credit rating agency announces that our ratings are under review for a potential downgrade. An increase in our borrowing costs, limitations on our ability to access the global capital and credit markets or a reduction in our liquidity could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. If we are not able to successfully implement shared services or utilize information technology systems and networks effectively, our ability to conduct our business may be negatively impacted. We have entered into agreements with third-party service providers to utilize certain information technology support services and administrative functions, including payroll processing, health and benefit plan administration and certain finance and accounting functions, and may enter into agreements for shared services in other functions in the future to achieve cost savings and efficiencies. In addition, we utilize cloud-based services and systems and networks managed by third-party vendors to process, transmit and store information and to conduct certain of our business activities and transactions with employees, customers, consumers and other third parties. If any of these third-party service providers or vendors do not perform effectively, or if we fail to adequately monitor their performance, we may not be able to achieve the expected cost savings or we may have to incur additional costs to correct errors made by such service providers and our reputation could be harmed. Depending on the function involved, such errors may also lead to business disruption, processing inefficiencies, the loss of or damage to intellectual property or sensitive data through security breaches or otherwise, adverse effects on financial reporting, litigation or remediation costs, or damage to our reputation, which could have a negative impact on employee morale. We continue on our multi-year business transformation initiative to migrate certain of our systems, including our financial processing systems, to enterprise-wide systems solutions. These systems implementations are part of our ongoing global business transformation initiative, and we plan to continue implementing such systems throughout other parts of our businesses. If we do not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build and sustain the proper information technology infrastructure, or if we fail to achieve the expected benefits from this initiative, it may impact our ability to process transactions accurately and efficiently, and remain in step with the changing needs of our business, which could result in the loss of customers or consumers and revenue. In addition, the failure to either deliver the applications on time, or anticipate the necessary readiness and training needs, could lead to business disruption and loss of customers or consumers and revenue. In connection with these implementations and resulting business process changes, we continue to enhance the design and documentation of business processes and controls, including our internal control over financial reporting processes, to maintain effective controls over our financial reporting. To date, this transition has not materially affected, and we do not expect it to materially affect, our internal 26 Table of Contents control over financial reporting. Fluctuations in exchange rates impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. We hold assets, incur liabilities, earn revenues and pay expenses in a variety of currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Because our consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars, the financial statements of our subsidiaries outside the United States, where the functional currency is other than the U.S. dollar, are translated into U.S. dollars. Our operations outside of the United States, particularly in Mexico, Russia, Canada, the United Kingdom and Brazil, generate a significant portion of our net revenue. In addition, we purchase many of the ingredients, raw materials and commodities used in our business in numerous markets and in numerous currencies. Fluctuations in exchange rates, including as a result of currency controls or other currency exchange restrictions have had, and may continue to have, an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Climate change, water scarcity or legal, regulatory or market measures to address climate change or water scarcity may negatively affect our business and operations or damage our reputation. There is concern that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere have an adverse impact on global temperatures, weather patterns and the frequency and severity of extreme weather and natural disasters. In the event that such climate change has a negative effect on agricultural productivity, we may be subject to decreased availability or less favorable pricing for certain commodities that are necessary for our products, such as sugar cane, corn, wheat, rice, oats, oranges and other fruits and potatoes. Natural disasters and extreme weather conditions, such as a hurricane, earthquake or flooding, may disrupt the productivity of our facilities or the operation of our supply chain and unfavorably impact the demand for, or our consumer's ability to purchase, our products. The predicted effects of climate change may also exacerbate challenges regarding the availability and quality of water. As demand for water access continues to increase around the world, we may be subject to decreased availability of water, deteriorated quality of water or less favorable pricing for water, which could adversely impact our manufacturing and distribution operations. Concern over climate change may result in new or increased regional, federal and/or global legal and regulatory requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of greenhouse gases, or to limit or impose additional costs on commercial water use due to local water scarcity concerns. In the event that such regulation is more stringent than current regulatory obligations or the measures that we are currently undertaking to monitor and improve our energy efficiency and water conservation, we may experience disruptions in, or significant increases in our costs of, operation and delivery and we may be required to make additional investments in facilities and equipment or relocate our facilities. In particular, increasing regulation of fuel emissions could substantially increase the cost of energy, including fuel, required to operate our facilities or transport and distribute our products, thereby substantially increasing the distribution and supply chain costs associated with our products. As a result, the effects of climate change or water scarcity could negatively affect our business and operations. In addition, any failure to achieve our goals with respect to reducing our impact on the environment or perception (whether or not valid) of our failure to act responsibly with respect to water use and the environment or to effectively respond to new, or changes in, legal or regulatory requirements concerning climate change or water scarcity could result in adverse publicity and could adversely affect our business, reputation, financial condition or results of operations. There is also increased focus, including by governmental and non-governmental organizations, investors, customers and consumers on these and other environmental sustainability matters, including deforestation, land use, climate impact and water use. Our reputation could be damaged if we or others in our industry do not act, or are perceived not to act, responsibly with respect to our impact on the environment. 27 Table of Contents A portion of our workforce is represented by unions. Failure to successfully negotiate collective bargaining agreements, or strikes or work stoppages, could cause our business to suffer. Many of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements, and other employees may seek to be covered by collective bargaining agreements. Strikes or work stoppages or other business interruptions could occur if we are unable to renew these agreements on satisfactory terms or enter into new agreements on satisfactory terms or if we are unable to otherwise manage changes in, or that affect, our workforce, which could impair manufacturing and distribution of our products or result in a loss of sales, which could adversely impact our business, financial condition or results of operations. The terms and conditions of existing, renegotiated or new collective bargaining agreements could also increase our costs or otherwise affect our ability to fully implement future operational changes to enhance our efficiency or to adapt to changing business needs or strategy. If we are not able to adequately protect our intellectual property rights or if we are found to infringe the intellectual property rights of others, the value of our products or brands, or our competitive position, could be reduced, which could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations. We possess intellectual property rights that are important to our business. These intellectual property rights include ingredient formulas, trademarks, copyrights, patents, business processes and other trade secrets that are important to our business and relate to a variety of our products, their packaging, the processes for their production and the design and operation of various equipment used in our businesses. We protect our intellectual property rights globally through a combination of trademark, copyright, patent and trade secret laws, third-party assignment and nondisclosure agreements and monitoring of third-party misuses of our intellectual property. If we fail to obtain or adequately protect our trademarks, copyrights, patents, business processes and trade secrets, including our ingredient formulas, or if there is a change in law that limits or removes the current legal protections of our intellectual property, the value of our products and brands, or our competitive position, could be reduced and there could be an adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, if, in the course of developing new products or improving the quality of existing products, we are found to have infringed the intellectual property rights of others, directly or indirectly, such finding could have an adverse impact on our reputation, business, financial condition or results of operations and may limit our ability to introduce new products or improve the quality of existing products. Potential liabilities and costs from litigation, claims, legal or regulatory proceedings, inquiries or investigations could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations. We and our subsidiaries are party to a variety of litigation, claims, legal or regulatory proceedings, inquiries and investigations, including but not limited to matters related to our advertising, marketing or commercial practices, product labels, claims and ingredients including sugar, sodium and saturated fat, our intellectual property rights, alleged infringement or misappropriation by us of intellectual property rights of others, environmental, privacy, employment, tax and insurance matters and matters relating to our compliance with applicable laws and regulations. We evaluate such matters to assess the likelihood of unfavorable outcomes and estimate, if possible, the amount of potential losses and establish reserves as appropriate. These matters are inherently uncertain and there is no guarantee that we will be successful in defending ourselves in these matters, or that our assessment of the materiality of these matters and the likely outcome or potential losses and established reserves will be consistent with the ultimate outcome of such matters. In the event that management's assessment of actual or potential claims and proceedings proves inaccurate or litigation, claims, proceedings, inquiries or investigations that are material arise in the future, there may be a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Responding to litigation, claims, 28 Table of Contents proceedings, inquiries, and investigations, even those that are ultimately non-meritorious, may also require us to incur significant expense and devote significant resources, and may generate adverse publicity that may damage our reputation or brand image, which could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Many factors may adversely affect the price of our publicly traded securities. Many factors may adversely affect the price of our common stock and publicly traded debt. Such factors, some of which are beyond our control, may include, but are not limited to: unfavorable economic conditions; changes in financial or tax reporting and changes in accounting principles or practices that materially affect our reported financial condition and results; investor perceptions of our business, strategies and performance or those of our competitors; actions by shareholders or others seeking to influence our business strategies; speculation by the media or investment community regarding our business, strategies and performance or those of our competitors; developments relating to pending litigation, claims, investigations or inquiries; trading activity in our securities or trading activity in derivative instruments with respect to our securities; changes in our credit ratings; the impact of our share repurchase programs or dividend policy; and the outcome of referenda and elections. In addition, corporate actions, such as those we may or may not take from time to time as part of our continuous review of our corporate structure and our strategy, including as a result of business, legal, regulatory and tax considerations, may not have the impact we intend and may adversely affect the price of our securities. The above factors, as well as the other risks included in this ""Item 1A. Risk Factors,"" could adversely affect the price of our securities.","Item 7.

OUR BUSINESS Executive Overview We are a leading global food and beverage company with a complementary portfolio of enjoyable brands, including Frito-Lay, Gatorade, Pepsi-Cola, Quaker and Tropicana. Through our operations, authorized bottlers, contract manufacturers and other third parties, we make, market, distribute and sell a wide variety of convenient and enjoyable beverages, foods and snacks, serving customers and consumers in more than 200 countries and territories. At PepsiCo, we are focused on operating our company in a way that generates sustained financial growth and consistently strong returns and is also responsive to the needs of the world around us. We call this approach Performance with Purpose  -  it is embedded into our business and our strategy  -  and it enabled us to deliver another year of strong performance in 2017. As we look to 2018 and beyond, we believe our Performance with Purpose strategy will enable us to continue delivering strong performance while positioning our Company for long-term sustainable growth. Our strategies are designed to address key challenges facing our Company, including: macroeconomic and political volatility and the continued rebalancing of the economic world; shifting consumer preferences and increasing demand for more nutritious foods and beverages; the disruption of retail; the expansion of hard discounters; and the emergence of niche brands laying claim to large consumer segments, particularly in developed markets. We intend to focus on the following areas to address and adapt to these challenges:  Utilizing the strength of our distribution system to offer consumers a wide array of choices, from ""fun-for-you"" to ""better-for-you"" to ""good-for-you"" products to meet consumers' demand for more nutritious foods and beverages;  Continuing to strengthen our retail and foodservice relationships to sell our products faster, increase cash flow and engage consumers;  Minimizing our environmental footprint to streamline costs and mitigate our operational impact on the communities in which we operate;  Continuing to invest in our associates so that we have the best talent to position our company for continued growth; and  Continuing our investments in e-commerce and digital solutions to meet changing consumer consumption patterns and capture cost savings while streamlining our operations. See also ""Item 1A. Risk Factors"" for additional information about risks and uncertainties that the Company faces. Our Operations See ""Item 1. Business"" for information on our divisions and a description of our distribution network, ingredients and other supplies, brands and intellectual property rights, seasonality, customers and competition. In addition, see Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements for financial information about our divisions 45 Table of Contents and geographic areas. Other Relationships Certain members of our Board of Directors also serve on the boards of certain vendors and customers. These Board members do not participate in our vendor selection and negotiations nor in our customer negotiations. Our transactions with these vendors and customers are in the normal course of business and are consistent with terms negotiated with other vendors and customers. In addition, certain of our employees serve on the boards of Pepsi Bottling Ventures LLC and other affiliated companies of PepsiCo and do not receive incremental compensation for such services. Our Business Risks We are subject to risks in the normal course of business. During 2017 and 2016, certain jurisdictions in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold operated in a challenging environment, experiencing unstable economic, political and social conditions, civil unrest, natural disasters, debt and credit issues, and currency fluctuations. We continue to monitor the economic, operating and political environment in these markets closely and to identify actions to potentially mitigate any unfavorable impacts on our future results. The hurricanes and earthquakes which occurred in the third and fourth quarters of 2017 in North and Central America did not materially impact our consolidated financial results in 2017. In addition, certain jurisdictions in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold have either imposed, or are considering imposing, new or increased taxes on the manufacture, distribution or sale of our products, ingredients or substances contained in, or attributes of, our products or commodities used in the production of our products. These taxes vary in scope and form: some apply to all beverages, including non-caloric beverages, while others apply only to beverages with a caloric sweetener (e.g., sugar). Similarly, some measures apply a single tax rate per liquid ounce while others apply a graduated tax rate depending upon the amount of added sugar in the beverage and some apply a flat tax rate on beverages containing a particular substance or ingredient. We sell a wide variety of beverages, foods and snack in more than 200 countries and territories and the profile of the products we sell, and the amount of revenue attributable to such products, varies by jurisdiction. Because of this, we cannot predict the scope or form potential taxes or other potential limitations on our products may take, and therefore cannot predict the impact of such taxes or limitations on our financial results. In addition, taxes and limitations may impact us and our competitors differently. We continue to monitor existing and proposed taxes in the jurisdictions in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed and sold and to consider actions we may take to potentially mitigate the unfavorable impact, if any, of such taxes or limitations, including advocating alternative measures with respect to the imposition, form and scope of any such taxes or limitations. In addition, our industry has been affected by disruption of the retail landscape, including the rapid growth in sales through e-commerce websites and mobile commerce applications, the integration of physical and digital operations among retailers and the international expansion of hard discounters. We continue to monitor changes in the retail landscape and to identify actions we may take to build our global e-commerce capabilities, distribute our products effectively through all existing and emerging channels of trade and potentially mitigate any unfavorable impacts on our future results. During the fourth quarter of 2017, the TCJ Act was enacted in the United States. The changes in the TCJ Act are broad and complex and we continue to examine the impact the TCJ Act may have on our business and financial results. Among its many provisions, the TCJ Act imposed a mandatory one-time transition tax on undistributed international earnings and reduced the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%. As a result of the enactment of the TCJ Act, we recognized a provisional net tax expense of $2.5 billion in the fourth quarter of 2017. See further information in ""Items Affecting Comparability."" The recorded impact of 46 Table of Contents the TCJ Act is provisional and the final amount may differ from the above estimate, possibly materially, due to, among other things, changes in estimates, interpretations and assumptions we have made, changes in IRS interpretations, the issuance of new guidance, legislative actions, changes in accounting standards or related interpretations in response to the TCJ Act and future actions by states within the United States that have not currently adopted the TCJ Act. For additional information, see ""Our Liquidity and Capital Resources,"" ""Our Critical Accounting Policies"" and Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements. See also ""Item 1A. Risk Factors,"" ""Executive Overview"" above and ""Market Risks"" below for more information about these risks and the actions we have taken to address key challenges. Risk Management Framework The achievement of our strategic and operating objectives involves taking risks and that those risks may evolve over time. To identify, assess, prioritize, address, manage, monitor and communicate these risks across the Company's operations, we leverage an integrated risk management framework. This framework includes the following:  PepsiCo's Board of Directors has oversight responsibility for PepsiCo's integrated risk management framework. One of the Board's primary responsibilities is overseeing and interacting with senior management with respect to key aspects of the Company's business, including risk assessment and risk mitigation of the Company's top risks. The Board receives updates on key risks throughout the year. In addition, the Board has tasked designated Committees of the Board with oversight of certain categories of risk management, and the Committees report to the Board regularly on these matters. <U+25E6> The Audit Committee of the Board reviews and assesses the guidelines and policies governing PepsiCo's risk management and oversight processes, and assists the Board's oversight of financial, compliance and employee safety risks facing PepsiCo; <U+25E6> The Compensation Committee of the Board reviews PepsiCo's employee compensation policies and practices to assess whether such policies and practices could lead to unnecessary risk-taking behavior; <U+25E6> The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee assists the Board in its oversight of the Company's governance structure and other corporate governance matters, including succession planning; and <U+25E6> The Public Policy and Sustainability Committee of the Board assists the Board in its oversight of PepsiCo's policies, programs and related risks that concern key public policy and sustainability matters.  The PepsiCo Risk Committee (PRC), which is comprised of a cross-functional, geographically diverse, senior management group, including PepsiCo's Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, meets regularly to identify, assess, prioritize and address top strategic, financial, operating, compliance, safety, reputational and other risks. The PRC is also responsible for reporting progress on our risk mitigation efforts to the Board;  Division and key country risk committees, comprised of cross-functional senior management teams, meet regularly to identify, assess, prioritize and address division and country-specific business risks;  PepsiCo's Risk Management Office, which manages the overall risk management process, provides ongoing guidance, tools and analytical support to the PRC and the division and key country risk committees, identifies and assesses potential risks and facilitates ongoing communication between the parties, as well as with PepsiCo's Board of Directors and the Audit Committee of the Board; 47 Table of Contents  PepsiCo's Corporate Audit Department evaluates the ongoing effectiveness of our key internal controls through periodic audit and review procedures; and  PepsiCo's Compliance & Ethics Department leads and coordinates our compliance policies and practices. Market Risks We are exposed to market risks arising from adverse changes in:  commodity prices, affecting the cost of our raw materials and energy;  foreign exchange rates and currency restrictions; and  interest rates. In the normal course of business, we manage commodity price, foreign exchange and interest rate risks through a variety of strategies, including productivity initiatives, global purchasing programs and hedging. Ongoing productivity initiatives involve the identification and effective implementation of meaningful cost-saving opportunities or efficiencies, including the use of derivatives. Our global purchasing programs include fixed-price contracts and purchase orders and pricing agreements. See ""Uncertain or unfavorable economic conditions may have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations."" and ""Our business, financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected by increased costs, disruption of supply or shortages of raw materials, energy, water and other supplies."" in ""Item 1A. Risk Factors."" See ""Our Liquidity and Capital Resources"" for further information on our non-cancelable purchasing commitments. The fair value of our derivatives fluctuates based on market rates and prices. The sensitivity of our derivatives to these market fluctuations is discussed below. See Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of these derivatives and our hedging policies. See ""Our Critical Accounting Policies"" for a discussion of the exposure of our pension and retiree medical plan assets and liabilities to risks related to market fluctuations. Inflationary, deflationary and recessionary conditions impacting these market risks also impact the demand for and pricing of our products. See ""Item 1A. Risk Factors"" for further discussion. Commodity Prices Our commodity derivatives had a total notional value of $0.9 billion as of December 30, 2017 and $0.8 billion as of December 31, 2016. At the end of 2017, the potential change in fair value of commodity derivative instruments, assuming a 10% decrease in the underlying commodity price, would have decreased our net unrealized gains in 2017 by $96 million. Foreign Exchange Our operations outside of the United States generated 42% of our net revenue in 2017, with Mexico, Russia, Canada, the United Kingdom and Brazil comprising approximately 20% of our net revenue in 2017. As a result, we are exposed to foreign exchange risks in the international markets in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold. During 2017, unfavorable foreign exchange had a net nominal impact on net revenue growth due to declines in the Egyptian pound, Turkish lira and Pound sterling, offset by appreciation in the Russian ruble, Brazilian real and euro. Currency declines against the U.S. dollar which are not offset could adversely impact our future financial results. In addition, volatile economic, political and social conditions and civil unrest in certain markets in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold, including in Brazil, China, India, Mexico, the 48 Table of Contents Middle East, Russia and Turkey, and currency fluctuations in certain of these international markets continue to result in challenging operating environments. We also continue to monitor the economic and political developments related to the United Kingdom's pending withdrawal from the European Union, including how the United Kingdom will interact with other European Union countries following its departure, and the potential impact for the ESSA segment and our other businesses. Starting in 2014, Russia announced economic sanctions against the United States and other nations that include a ban on imports of certain ingredients and finished goods from specific countries. These sanctions have not had and are not expected to have a material impact on the results of our operations in Russia or our consolidated results or financial position, and we will continue to monitor the economic, operating and political environment in Russia closely. For the years ended December 30, 2017, December 31, 2016 and December 26, 2015, net revenue generated by our operations in Russia represented 5%, 4% and 4% of our consolidated net revenue, respectively. As of December 30, 2017, our long-lived assets in Russia were $4.7 billion. Our foreign currency derivatives had a total notional value of $1.6 billion as of December 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016. The total notional amount of our debt instruments designated as net investment hedges was $1.5 billion as of December 30, 2017 and $0.8 billion as of December 31, 2016. At the end of 2017, we estimate that an unfavorable 10% change in the underlying exchange rates would have increased our net unrealized losses in 2017 by $125 million. Due to exchange restrictions and other conditions that significantly impact our ability to effectively manage our businesses in Venezuela and realize earnings generated by our Venezuelan businesses, effective at the end of the third quarter of 2015, we deconsolidated our Venezuelan subsidiaries and began accounting for our investments in our Venezuelan subsidiaries and joint venture using the cost method of accounting. In 2015, we recorded pre- and after-tax charges of $1.4 billion in our income statement to reduce the value of the cost method investments to their estimated fair values, resulting in a full impairment. The factors that led to our conclusions at the end of the third quarter of 2015 continued to exist through the end of 2017, and we expect these conditions will continue for the foreseeable future. We do not have any guarantees related to our Venezuelan entities, and our ongoing contractual commitments to our Venezuelan businesses are not material. We will recognize income from dividends and sales of inventory to our Venezuelan entities, which have not been and are not expected to be material, to the extent cash in U.S. dollars is received. We have not received any cash in U.S. dollars from our Venezuelan entities since our deconsolidation at the end of the third quarter of 2015. We continue to monitor the conditions in Venezuela and their impact on our accounting and disclosures. For further information, please refer to Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements and ""Items Affecting Comparability."" Interest Rates Our interest rate derivatives had a total notional value of $14.2 billion as of December 30, 2017 and $11.2 billion as of December 31, 2016. Assuming year-end 2017 investment levels and variable rate debt, a 1-percentage-point increase in interest rates would have decreased our net interest expense in 2017 by $25 million due to higher cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments levels as compared with our variable rate debt. 49 Table of Contents OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS Results of Operations  -  Consolidated Review In the discussions of net revenue and operating profit below, ""effective net pricing"" reflects the year-over-year impact of discrete pricing actions, sales incentive activities and mix resulting from selling varying products in different package sizes and in different countries and ""net pricing"" reflects the year-over-year combined impact of list price changes, weight changes per package, discounts and allowances. Additionally, ""acquisitions and divestitures,"" except as otherwise noted, reflect all mergers and acquisitions activity, including the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and changes in ownership or control in consolidated subsidiaries and nonconsolidated equity investees. The impact of the structural change related to the deconsolidation of our Venezuelan businesses is presented separately. Volume Our beverage volume in the NAB, Latin America, ESSA and AMENA segments reflects sales to authorized bottlers, independent distributors and retailers, as well as the sale of beverages bearing Company-owned or licensed trademarks that have been sold through our authorized independent bottlers. Bottler case sales (BCS) and concentrate shipments and equivalents (CSE) are not necessarily equal during any given period due to seasonality, timing of product launches, product mix, bottler inventory practices and other factors. While our beverage revenues are not entirely based on BCS volume, as there are independent bottlers in the supply chain, we believe that BCS is a valuable measure as it quantifies the sell-through of our beverage products at the consumer level. Sales of products from our unconsolidated joint ventures are reflected in our reported volume. NAB, Latin America, ESSA and AMENA, either independently or in conjunction with third parties, make, market, distribute and sell ready-to-drink tea products through a joint venture with Unilever (under the Lipton brand name), and NAB further, either independently or in conjunction with third parties, makes, markets, distributes and sells ready-to-drink coffee products through a joint venture with Starbucks. In addition, AMENA licenses the Tropicana brand for use in China on co-branded juice products in connection with a strategic alliance with Tingyi. Our food and snacks volume in the FLNA, QFNA, Latin America, ESSA and AMENA segments is reported on a system-wide basis, which includes our own sales and the sales by our noncontrolled affiliates of snacks bearing Company-owned or licensed trademarks. Servings Since our divisions each use different measures of physical unit volume (i.e., kilos, gallons, pounds and case sales), a common servings metric is necessary to reflect our consolidated physical unit volume. Our divisions' physical volume measures are converted into servings based on U.S. Food and Drug Administration guidelines for single-serving sizes of our products. In 2017, total servings decreased 1% compared to 2016. In 2016, total servings increased 3% compared to 2015. Excluding the impact of the 53rd reporting week in 2016, total servings in 2017 was even with the prior year and total servings in 2016 increased 2% compared to 2015. Servings growth reflects adjustments to the prior year results for divestitures and other structural changes, including the deconsolidation of our Venezuelan businesses effective as of the end of the third quarter of 2015. 50 Table of Contents Consolidated Net Revenue and Operating Profit Change   2017   2016   2015   2017   2016 Net revenue $ 63,525     $ 62,799     $ 63,056     1 %    -   % Operating profit $ 10,509     $ 9,785     $ 8,353     7 %   17  % Operating profit margin 16.5 %   15.6 %   13.2 %   1.0     2.3 See ""Results of Operations  -  Division Review"" for a tabular presentation and discussion of key drivers of net revenue. 2017 Operating profit increased 7% and operating margin improved 1.0 percentage points. Operating profit growth was driven by the benefit of actions associated with our productivity initiatives, which contributed more than $1 billion in cost reductions across a number of expense categories, as well as effective net pricing. Items affecting comparability (see ""Items Affecting Comparability"") also contributed 4 percentage points to operating profit growth and increased operating profit margin by 0.5 percentage points, primarily reflecting a prior-year impairment charge to reduce the value of our 5% indirect equity interest in TAB to its estimated fair value. Additionally, the impact of refranchising our beverage business in Jordan and a gain associated with the sale of our minority stake in Britvic each contributed 1 percentage point to operating profit growth. These impacts were partially offset by certain operating cost increases, higher commodity costs and unfavorable foreign exchange. Commodity inflation reduced operating profit growth by 6 percentage points, primarily attributable to inflation in the AMENA, Latin America, ESSA, NAB and FLNA segments. Corporate unallocated expenses (see Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements) decreased 9%, reflecting the impact of higher prior-year contributions to The PepsiCo Foundation, Inc. to fund charitable and social programs. 2016 Operating profit increased 17% and operating margin increased 2.3 percentage points. Operating profit growth was driven by the benefit of actions associated with our productivity initiatives, which contributed more than $1 billion in cost reductions across a number of expense categories, effective net pricing and volume growth. Additionally, the impact of recording an impairment charge in 2015 and ceasing the operations of our MQD joint venture contributed 1 percentage point to operating profit growth. These impacts were partially offset by certain operating cost increases, higher advertising and marketing expenses, unfavorable foreign exchange and higher commodity costs, as well as the deconsolidation of our Venezuelan businesses, which reduced operating profit growth by 2 percentage points. Items affecting comparability (see ""Items Affecting Comparability"") contributed 13 percentage points to operating profit growth and increased operating profit margin by 1.5 percentage points, primarily reflecting a 17-percentage-point contribution from the 2015 Venezuela impairment charges. Higher commodity inflation reduced operating profit growth by 1 percentage point, primarily attributable to inflation in the Latin America, ESSA and AMENA segments, partially offset by deflation in the NAB, FLNA and QFNA segments. The impact of our 53rd reporting week was fully offset by incremental investments we made in our business. Corporate unallocated expenses (see Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements) decreased 1%, driven by lower pension expense reflecting the change to the full yield curve approach, lower foreign exchange transaction losses and decreases in other corporate expenses, partially offset by increased contributions to The PepsiCo Foundation, Inc. to fund charitable and social programs and the net impact of items affecting comparability mentioned above included in corporate unallocated expenses. 51 Table of Contents Other Consolidated Results Change     2017   2016   2015   2017   2016 Net interest expense   $ (907 )   $ (1,232 )   $ (911 )   $ 325     $ (321 ) Annual tax rate (a)   48.9 %   25.4 %   26.1 %         Net income attributable to PepsiCo   $ 4,857     $ 6,329     $ 5,452     (23 )%   16 % Net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share  -  diluted   $ 3.38     $ 4.36     $ 3.67     (23 )%   19 % Mark-to-market net impact   (0.01 )   (0.08 )    -            Restructuring and impairment charges   0.16     0.09     0.12           Provisional net tax expense related to the TCJ Act (a)   1.70      -       -            Charges related to the transaction with Tingyi    -      0.26     0.05           Charge related to debt redemption    -      0.11      -            Pension-related settlement charge/(benefits)    -      0.11     (0.03 )         Venezuela impairment charges    -       -      0.91           Tax benefit    -       -      (0.15 )         Net income attributable to PepsiCo per common     share  -  diluted, excluding above items (b)   $ 5.23     $ 4.85     $ 4.57     8  %   6 % Impact of foreign exchange translation               1     3   Growth in net income attributable to PepsiCo per    common share  -  diluted, excluding above items, on      a constant currency basis (b)               9  %   9 % (a) See Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements. (b) See ""Non-GAAP Measures."" 2017 Net interest expense decreased $325 million reflecting a prior-year charge of $233 million representing the premium paid in accordance with the ""make-whole"" redemption provisions to redeem all of our outstanding 7.900% senior notes due 2018 and 5.125% senior notes due 2019 for the principal amounts of $1.5 billion and $750 million, respectively. This decrease also reflects higher interest income due to higher interest rates and average cash balances, as well as gains on the market value of investments used to economically hedge a portion of our deferred compensation liability. These impacts were partially offset by higher interest expense due to higher average debt balances. The reported tax rate increased 23.5 percentage points primarily as a result of the provisional net tax expense related to the TCJ Act, which contributed 26 percentage points to the increase, partially offset by the impact of the prior-year impairment charge to reduce the value of our 5% indirect equity interest in TAB to its estimated fair value, which had no corresponding tax benefit, as well as the impact of recognizing excess tax benefits in the provision for income taxes as a result of the changes in accounting for certain aspects of share-based payments to employees in the current year. See Note 2 and Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information. Net income attributable to PepsiCo and net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share both decreased 23%. Items affecting comparability (see ""Items Affecting Comparability"") negatively impacted both net income attributable to PepsiCo and net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share by 30 percentage points, primarily as a result of the provisional net tax expense related to the TCJ Act. 52 Table of Contents 2016 Net interest expense increased $321 million reflecting a charge of $233 million representing the premium paid in accordance with the ""make-whole"" redemption provisions to redeem all of our outstanding 7.900% senior notes due 2018 and 5.125% senior notes due 2019 for the principal amounts of $1.5 billion and $750 million, respectively. This increase also reflects higher average debt balances, partially offset by higher interest income due to higher average cash balances, as well as gains on the market value of investments used to economically hedge a portion of our deferred compensation liability. The reported tax rate decreased 0.7 percentage points due to the impact of the 2015 Venezuela impairment charges, which had no corresponding tax benefit, partially offset by the 2015 favorable resolution with the IRS of substantially all open matters related to the audits for taxable years 2010 and 2011, as well as the 2016 impairment charge recorded to reduce the value of our 5% indirect equity interest in TAB to its estimated fair value, which had no corresponding tax benefit. Net income attributable to PepsiCo increased 16% and net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share increased 19%. Items affecting comparability (see ""Items Affecting Comparability"") positively contributed 12 percentage points to net income attributable to PepsiCo and 13 percentage points to net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share. Non-GAAP Measures Certain financial measures contained in this Form 10-K adjust for the impact of specified items and are not in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). We use non-GAAP financial measures internally to make operating and strategic decisions, including the preparation of our annual operating plan, evaluation of our overall business performance and as a factor in determining compensation for certain employees. We believe presenting non-GAAP financial measures in this Form 10-K provides additional information to facilitate comparison of our historical operating results and trends in our underlying operating results, and provides additional transparency on how we evaluate our business. We also believe presenting these measures in this Form 10-K allows investors to view our performance using the same measures that we use in evaluating our financial and business performance and trends. We consider quantitative and qualitative factors in assessing whether to adjust for the impact of items that may be significant or that could affect an understanding of our ongoing financial and business performance or trends. Examples of items for which we may make adjustments include: amounts related to mark-to-market gains or losses (non-cash); charges related to restructuring programs; charges or adjustments related to the enactment of new laws, rules or regulations, such as significant tax law changes; gains or losses associated with mergers, acquisitions, divestitures and other structural changes; debt redemptions; pension and retiree medical related items; amounts related to the resolution of tax positions; asset impairments (non-cash); and remeasurements of net monetary assets. See below and ""Items Affecting Comparability"" for a description of adjustments to our U.S. GAAP financial measures in this Form 10-K. Non-GAAP information should be considered as supplemental in nature and is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. In addition, our non-GAAP financial measures may not be the same as or comparable to similar non-GAAP measures presented by other companies. The following non-GAAP financial measures are contained in this Form 10-K:  cost of sales, gross profit, selling, general and administrative expenses, interest expense, noncontrolling interests and provision for income taxes, each adjusted for items affecting comparability; 53 Table of Contents  operating profit/loss, adjusted for items affecting comparability, and net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share  -  diluted, adjusted for items affecting comparability, and the corresponding constant currency growth rates;  organic revenue;  free cash flow; and  return on invested capital (ROIC) and net ROIC, excluding items affecting comparability. Cost of Sales, Gross Profit, Selling, General and Administrative Expenses, Interest Expense, Noncontrolling Interests and Provision for Income Taxes, Adjusted for Items Affecting Comparability; Operating Profit/Loss, Adjusted for Items Affecting Comparability, and Net Income Attributable to PepsiCo per Common Share  -  Diluted, Adjusted for Items Affecting Comparability, and the Corresponding Constant Currency Growth Rates Cost of sales, gross profit, selling, general and administrative expenses, interest expense, noncontrolling interests and provision for income taxes, adjusted for items affecting comparability; operating profit/loss, adjusted for items affecting comparability, and net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share  -  diluted, adjusted for items affecting comparability, exclude the net impact of mark-to-market gains and losses on centrally managed commodity derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting, restructuring and impairment charges related to our 2014 and 2012 Productivity Plans, a provisional net tax expense associated with the enactment of the TCJ Act, charges related to the transaction with Tingyi, a charge related to debt redemption, pension-related settlements, Venezuela impairment charges and a tax benefit (see ""Items Affecting Comparability"" for a detailed description of each of these items). We also evaluate performance on operating profit/loss, adjusted for items affecting comparability, and net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share  -  diluted, adjusted for items affecting comparability, on a constant currency basis, which measure our financial results assuming constant foreign currency exchange rates used for translation based on the rates in effect for the comparable prior-year period. In order to compute our constant currency results, we multiply or divide, as appropriate, our current year U.S. dollar results by the current year average foreign exchange rates and then multiply or divide, as appropriate, those amounts by the prior-year average foreign exchange rates. We believe these measures provide useful information in evaluating the results of our business because they exclude items that we believe are not indicative of our ongoing performance. Organic Revenue We define organic revenue as net revenue adjusted for the impact of foreign exchange translation, as well as the impact from acquisitions, divestitures and other structural changes, including the Venezuela deconsolidation, for the comparable period. The Venezuela deconsolidation impact excluded the results of our Venezuelan businesses for the first three quarters of 2015. In addition, our fiscal 2016 reported results included an extra week of results. Organic revenue excludes the impact of the 53rd reporting week in the fourth quarter of 2016. We believe organic revenue provides useful information in evaluating the results of our business because it excludes items that we believe are not indicative of ongoing performance or that we believe impact comparability with the prior year. See ""Organic Revenue Growth"" in ""Results of Operations  -  Division Review."" Free Cash Flow We define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less capital spending, plus sales of property, plant and equipment. Since net capital spending is essential to our product innovation initiatives and maintaining our operational capabilities, we believe that it is a recurring and necessary use of cash. As such, we believe investors should also consider net capital spending when evaluating our cash from operating 54 Table of Contents activities. Free cash flow is used by us primarily for financing activities, including debt repayments, dividends and share repurchases. Free cash flow is not a measure of cash available for discretionary expenditures since we have certain non-discretionary obligations such as debt service that are not deducted from the measure. See ""Free Cash Flow"" in ""Our Liquidity and Capital Resources."" ROIC and Net ROIC, Excluding Items Affecting Comparability We define ROIC as net income attributable to PepsiCo plus interest expense after-tax divided by the sum of quarterly average debt obligations and quarterly average common shareholders' equity. Although ROIC is a common financial metric, numerous methods exist for calculating ROIC. Accordingly, the method used by management to calculate ROIC may differ from the methods other companies use to calculate their ROIC. We believe this metric serves as a measure of how well we use our capital to generate returns. In addition, we use net ROIC, excluding items affecting comparability, to compare our performance over various reporting periods on a consistent basis because it removes from our operating results the impact of items that are not indicative of our ongoing performance and reflects how management evaluates our operating results and trends. We define net ROIC, excluding items affecting comparability, as ROIC, adjusted for quarterly average cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, after-tax interest income and items affecting comparability. We believe the calculation of ROIC and net ROIC, excluding items affecting comparability, provides useful information to investors and is an additional relevant comparison of our performance to consider when evaluating our capital allocation efficiency.

Mark-to-Market Net Impact We centrally manage commodity derivatives on behalf of our divisions. These commodity derivatives include agricultural products, energy and metals. Commodity derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment are marked to market each period with the resulting gains and losses recorded in corporate unallocated expenses as either cost of sales or selling, general and administrative expenses, depending on the underlying commodity. These gains and losses are subsequently reflected in division results when the divisions recognize the cost of the underlying commodity in operating profit. Therefore, the divisions realize the economic effects of the derivative without experiencing any resulting mark-to-market volatility, which remains in corporate unallocated expenses. Restructuring and Impairment Charges 2014 Multi-Year Productivity Plan To build on the successful implementation of the 2014 Productivity Plan to date, we expanded and extended the program through the end of 2019 to take advantage of additional opportunities within the initiatives of the 2014 Productivity Plan to further strengthen our food, snack and beverage businesses. We now expect to incur pre-tax charges and cash expenditures of approximately $1.3 billion and $985 million, respectively, as compared to our previous estimate of pre-tax charges and cash expenditures of approximately $990 million and $705 million, respectively. 56 Table of Contents The expected pre-tax charges and cash expenditures are summarized by year as follows: Charges   Cash Expenditures   2013   $ 53     $  -      2014   357     175   (b) 2015   169     165   (b) 2016   160     95     2017   295     113     2018 (expected)   254     396     2019 (expected)   17     41         $ 1,305   (a) $ 985 (a) This total pre-tax charge is expected to consist of approximately $795 million of severance and other employee-related costs, approximately $165 million for asset impairments (all non-cash) resulting from plant closures and related actions, and approximately $345 million for other costs associated with the implementation of our initiatives, including contract termination costs. This charge is expected to impact reportable segments and Corporate approximately as follows: FLNA 14%, QFNA 3%, NAB 30%, Latin America 15%, ESSA 25%, AMENA 4% and Corporate 9%. (b) In 2015 and 2014, cash expenditures include $2 million and $10 million, respectively, reported on our cash flow statement in pension and retiree medical plan contributions. See Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements for further information related to our 2014 and 2012 Productivity Plans. We regularly evaluate different productivity initiatives beyond the productivity plans and other initiatives discussed above and in Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements. Provisional Net Tax Expense Related to the TCJ Act In 2017, we recorded a provisional net tax expense of $2.5 billion ($1.70 per share) associated with the enactment of the TCJ Act in the fourth quarter of 2017. Included in the net tax expense of $2.5 billion is a provisional mandatory one-time transition tax of approximately $4 billion on undistributed international earnings, included in other liabilities. This mandatory one-time transition tax was partially offset by a provisional $1.5 billion benefit resulting from the required remeasurement of our deferred tax assets and liabilities to the new, lower U.S. corporate income tax rate. See Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements. Charges Related to the Transaction with Tingyi In 2016, we recorded a pre- and after-tax impairment charge of $373 million ($0.26 per share) in the AMENA segment to reduce the value of our 5% indirect equity interest in TAB to its estimated fair value. In 2015, we recorded a pre- and after-tax charge of $73 million ($0.05 per share) in the AMENA segment related to a write-off of the value of a call option to increase our holding in TAB to 20%. See Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements. Charge Related to Debt Redemption In 2016, we paid $2.5 billion to redeem all of our outstanding 7.900% senior notes due 2018 and 5.125% senior notes due 2019 for the principal amounts of $1.5 billion and $750 million, respectively, and terminated certain interest rate swaps. As a result, we recorded a pre-tax charge of $233 million ($156 million after-tax or $0.11 per share) to interest expense, primarily representing the premium paid in accordance with the ""make-whole"" redemption provisions. See Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements. 57 Table of Contents Pension-Related Settlements In 2016, we recorded a pre-tax pension settlement charge in corporate unallocated expenses of $242 million ($162 million after-tax or $0.11 per share) related to the purchase of a group annuity contract. See Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements. In 2015, we recorded pre-tax benefits of $67 million ($42 million after-tax or $0.03 per share) in the NAB segment associated with the settlement of pension-related liabilities from previous acquisitions. These benefits were recognized in selling, general and administrative expenses. Venezuela Impairment Charges In 2015, we recorded pre- and after-tax charges of $1.4 billion ($0.91 per share) in the Latin America segment related to the impairment of investments in our wholly-owned Venezuelan subsidiaries and beverage joint venture. See Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements and ""Our Business Risks."" Tax Benefit In 2015, we recognized a non-cash tax benefit of $230 million ($0.15 per share) associated with our agreement with the IRS resolving substantially all open matters related to the audits for taxable years 2010 through 2011, which reduced our reserve for uncertain tax positions for the tax years 2010 and 2011. See Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements. 58 Table of Contents Results of Operations  -  Division Review The results and discussions below are based on how our Chief Executive Officer monitors the performance of our divisions. Accordingly, volume growth measures for 2016 reflect adjustments to the base year for divestitures and other structural changes, including the deconsolidation of our Venezuelan businesses effective as of the end of the third quarter of 2015.

Operating profit decreased 2%, reflecting certain operating cost increases and the net revenue performance. The 53rd reporting week in the prior year negatively impacted operating profit performance by 2 percentage points. These impacts were partially offset by planned cost reductions across a number of expense categories and lower advertising and marketing expenses, as well as the impact of prior-year incremental investments into our business, which positively contributed 1.5 percentage points to operating profit performance. Restructuring and impairment charges in the above table (see ""Items Affecting Comparability"") negatively impacted operating profit performance by 1.5 percentage points. 2016 Net revenue grew 1%, driven by the 53rd reporting week which contributed 2 percentage points to the net revenue growth, partially offset by unfavorable net pricing and mix and unfavorable foreign exchange. Volume grew 2%, reflecting mid-single-digit growth in Aunt Jemima syrup and mix and low-single-digit growth in ready-to-eat cereals, oatmeal and bars. The 53rd reporting week contributed 2 percentage points to the volume growth. Operating profit increased 16%, impacted by 2015 impairment charges related to our dairy joint venture and ceasing its operations, which contributed 17 percentage points to operating profit growth. This increase also reflects planned cost reductions across a number of expense categories, as well as lower commodity costs, which contributed 6 percentage points to operating profit growth. These impacts were partially offset by higher advertising and marketing expenses, certain operating cost increases and the unfavorable net pricing and mix.

The 53rd reporting week in the prior year negatively impacted net revenue performance by 1 percentage point. Volume decreased 3.5%, driven by a 5% decline in CSD volume and a 1% decline in non-carbonated beverage volume. The non-carbonated beverage volume decrease primarily reflected mid-single-digit declines in Gatorade sports drinks and in our juice and juice drinks portfolio, partially offset by a mid-single-digit increase in our overall water portfolio and a low-single-digit increase in Lipton ready-to-drink teas. Acquisitions had a nominal positive contribution to the volume performance. The 53rd reporting week in the prior year negatively impacted volume performance by 1.5 percentage points. Operating profit decreased 9%, primarily reflecting certain operating cost increases and the net revenue performance, as well as higher commodity costs which negatively impacted operating profit performance by 2 percentage points. These impacts were partially offset by planned cost reductions across a number of expense categories and lower advertising and marketing expenses. Costs related to the hurricanes that occurred in the current year negatively impacted operating profit performance by 1 percentage point and were offset by a gain associated with a sale of an asset.

Restructuring and impairment charges in the above table (see ""Items Affecting Comparability"") reduced operating profit growth by 4 percentage points. 2016 Net revenue decreased 17%, reflecting the impact of the deconsolidation of our Venezuelan businesses, 64 Table of Contents effective as of the end of the third quarter of 2015, and unfavorable foreign exchange, which negatively impacted net revenue performance by 14 percentage points and 11 percentage points, respectively. These impacts were partially offset by effective net pricing and net volume growth. Snacks volume grew 3%, reflecting a mid-single-digit increase in Mexico. Additionally, Brazil experienced a slight increase. Beverage volume decreased 2%, reflecting a double-digit decline in Argentina and low-single-digit declines in Mexico and Honduras, partially offset by a low-single-digit increase in Brazil and a mid-single-digit increase in Guatemala. Operating profit improvement primarily reflected the 2015 Venezuela impairment charges, included in items affecting comparability in the above table (see ""Items Affecting Comparability""). This improvement also reflects the effective net pricing, planned cost reductions across a number of expense categories and the net volume growth. Additionally, the impact of 2015 charges associated with productivity initiatives outside the scope of the 2014 and 2012 Productivity Plans contributed 4 percentage points to operating profit growth. These impacts were partially offset by certain operating cost increases, as well as the deconsolidation of our Venezuelan businesses, which reduced operating profit growth by 19 percentage points. Additionally, higher commodity costs reduced operating profit growth by 22 percentage points, largely due to transaction-related foreign exchange on purchases of raw materials, driven by a strong U.S. dollar.

Additionally, the Middle East experienced low-single-digit growth and Australia experienced mid-single-digit growth. Beverage volume declined 1%, reflecting a double-digit decline in India and a mid-single-digit decline in the Middle East, partially offset by mid-single-digit growth in China, high-single-digit growth in Pakistan and low-single-digit growth in the Philippines. Operating profit improvement primarily reflected a prior-year impairment charge to reduce the value of our 5% indirect equity interest in TAB to its estimated fair value, included in items affecting comparability in the above table (see ""Items Affecting Comparability""). The effective net pricing and planned cost reductions across a number of expense categories also increased operating profit growth. Additionally, the impact of refranchising our beverage business in Jordan contributed 14 percentage points to operating profit growth. These impacts were partially offset by certain operating cost increases, as well as higher commodity costs, which reduced operating profit growth by 32 percentage points, primarily due to transaction-related foreign exchange on raw material purchases driven by the weak Egyptian pound. Unfavorable foreign exchange translation reduced operating profit growth by 8 percentage points. 2016 Net revenue declined 1%, reflecting unfavorable foreign exchange, which negatively impacted net revenue performance by 5 percentage points, as well as unfavorable net pricing.

The impact from a 2015 gain related to the refranchising of a portion of our beverage business in India negatively impacted operating profit performance by 4 percentage points. This impact was partially offset by a 2015 impairment charge associated with a joint venture in the Middle East which positively contributed 3 percentage points to operating profit performance. 67 Table of Contents Our Liquidity and Capital Resources We believe that our cash generating capability and financial condition, together with our revolving credit facilities and other available methods of debt financing, such as commercial paper borrowings and long-term debt financing, will be adequate to meet our operating, investing and financing needs. Our primary sources of cash available to fund cash outflows, such as our anticipated share repurchases, dividend payments and scheduled debt maturities, include cash from operations and proceeds obtained from issuances of commercial paper and long-term debt. However, there can be no assurance that volatility in the global capital and credit markets will not impair our ability to access these markets on terms commercially acceptable to us, or at all. See Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements for a description of our credit facilities. See also ""Our Business Risks"" and ""Uncertain or unfavorable economic conditions may have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations."" in ""Item 1A. Risk Factors."" As of December 30, 2017, we had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments in our consolidated subsidiaries of $18.9 billion outside the United States. The TCJ Act imposed a mandatory one-time transition tax on undistributed international earnings, including the $18.9 billion held in our consolidated subsidiaries outside the United States as of December 30, 2017, as a result of which we recognized a provisional mandatory transition tax liability of approximately $4 billion in the fourth quarter of 2017. Under the provisions of the TCJ Act, this transition tax must be paid over eight years; we currently expect to pay this liability over the period 2019 to 2026. The recorded impact of the TCJ Act is provisional and the final amount may differ from the above estimate, possibly materially, due to, among other things, changes in estimates, interpretations and assumptions we have made, changes in IRS interpretations, the issuance of new guidance, legislative actions, changes in accounting standards or related interpretations in response to the TCJ Act and future actions by states within the United States that have not currently adopted the TCJ Act. In addition, as a result of this transition tax, we may access and repatriate our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments held in our foreign subsidiaries during 2018 without such funds being subject to further U.S. income tax liability. We are currently evaluating when to repatriate such funds currently held by our foreign subsidiaries and how to utilize such funds, including whether to utilize such funds or other available methods of debt financing, such as commercial paper borrowings, for our anticipated share repurchases, dividend payments, scheduled debt maturities, discretionary benefit plan contributions, capital expenditures, certain investments into our business or other uses. See ""Item 1A. Risk Factors,"" ""Our Business Risks,"" ""Items Affecting Comparability"" and ""Our Critical Accounting Policies"" as well as Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements. As of December 30, 2017, cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments in our consolidated subsidiaries subject to currency controls or currency exchange restrictions were not material. Furthermore, our cash provided from operating activities is somewhat impacted by seasonality. Working capital needs are impacted by weekly sales, which are generally highest in the third quarter due to seasonal and holiday-related sales patterns, and generally lowest in the first quarter. On a continuing basis, we consider various transactions to increase shareholder value and enhance our business results, including acquisitions, divestitures, joint ventures, dividends, share repurchases, productivity and other efficiency initiatives, and other structural changes. These transactions may result in future cash proceeds or payments. The table below summarizes our cash activity: 2017     2016     2015   Net cash provided by operating activities $ 9,994     $ 10,673     $ 10,864   Net cash used for investing activities $ (4,403 )   $ (7,148 )   $ (3,569 ) Net cash used for financing activities $ (4,186 )   $ (3,211 )   $ (4,112 ) 68 Table of Contents Operating Activities During 2017, net cash provided by operating activities was approximately $10 billion, compared to $10.7 billion in the prior year. The operating cash flow performance primarily reflects unfavorable working capital comparisons to the prior year. This decrease is mainly due to higher current year payments to vendors and customers, coupled with higher net cash tax payments in the current year, partially offset by lower pension and retiree medical plan contributions in the current year. In February 2018, we received approval from our Board of Directors to make discretionary contributions of $1.4 billion to the PepsiCo Employees Retirement Plan A (Plan A) in the United States that we intend to invest in fixed income securities. As of February 13, 2018, we contributed $750 million of the approved amount; we expect to contribute the remaining $650 million in the first quarter of 2018. During 2016, net cash provided by operating activities was $10.7 billion, compared to $10.9 billion in the prior year. The operating cash flow performance reflects discretionary pension contributions of $459 million. In addition, working capital reflects unfavorable comparisons to the prior year. These decreases were partially offset by lower net cash tax payments in the current year. Investing Activities During 2017, net cash used for investing activities was $4.4 billion, primarily reflecting net capital spending of $2.8 billion and net purchases of debt securities with maturities greater than three months of $1.9 billion. During 2016, net cash used for investing activities was $7.1 billion, primarily reflecting net purchases of debt securities with maturities greater than three months of $4.1 billion and net capital spending of $2.9 billion. See Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of capital spending by division; see Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our investments in debt securities. We expect 2018 net capital spending to be approximately $3.6 billion. Financing Activities During 2017, net cash used for financing activities was $4.2 billion, primarily reflecting the return of operating cash flow to our shareholders through dividend payments and share repurchases of $6.5 billion and net payments of short-term borrowings of $1.1 billion, partially offset by net proceeds from long-term debt of $3.1 billion and proceeds from exercises of stock options of $0.5 billion. During 2016, net cash used for financing activities was $3.2 billion, primarily reflecting the return of operating cash flow to our shareholders through dividend payments and share repurchases of $7.2 billion, debt redemptions of $2.5 billion, and withholding tax payments on restricted stock units (RSUs), performance stock units (PSUs) and PepsiCo equity performance units (PEPunits) converted of $0.1 billion, partially offset by net proceeds from long-term debt of $4.7 billion, net proceeds from short-term borrowings of $1.5 billion, and proceeds from exercises of stock options of $0.5 billion. We annually review our capital structure with our Board of Directors, including our dividend policy and share repurchase activity. On February 11, 2015, we announced a share repurchase program providing for the repurchase of up to $12.0 billion of PepsiCo common stock commencing from July 1, 2015 and expiring on June 30, 2018. On February 13, 2018, we announced a new share repurchase program providing for the repurchase of up to $15.0 billion of PepsiCo common stock commencing on July 1, 2018 and expiring on June 30, 2021. In addition, on February 13, 2018, we announced a 15.2% increase in our annualized dividend to $3.71 per share from $3.22 per share, effective with the dividend expected to be paid in June 2018. We expect to return a total of approximately $7 billion to shareholders in 2018 through share repurchases of approximately $2 billion and dividends of approximately $5 billion. 69 Table of Contents Free Cash Flow Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure. For further information on free cash flow see ""Non-GAAP Measures.""

In addition, when evaluating free cash flow, we also consider the following items impacting comparability: $6 million and $459 million in discretionary pension contributions and associated net cash tax benefits of $1 million and $151 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively; $113 million, $125 million and $214 million of payments related to restructuring charges and associated net cash tax benefits of $30 million, $22 million and $51 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively; net cash received related to interest rate swaps of $5 million in 2016; net cash tax benefit related to debt redemption charge of $83 million in 2016; and $88 million in pension-related settlements and associated net cash tax benefits of $31 million in 2015. We will also consider payments related to the provisional transition tax liability of approximately $4 billion, which we currently expect to be paid over the period 2019 to 2026 under the provisions of the TCJ Act, as an item impacting comparability. We use free cash flow primarily for financing activities, including debt repayments, dividends and share repurchases. We expect to continue to return free cash flow to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases while maintaining Tier 1 commercial paper access, which we believe will facilitate appropriate financial flexibility and ready access to global capital and credit markets at favorable interest rates. However, see ""Our borrowing costs and access to capital and credit markets may be adversely affected by a downgrade or potential downgrade of our credit ratings."" in ""Item 1A. Risk Factors"" and ""Our Business Risks"" for certain factors that may impact our credit ratings or our operating cash flows. Any downgrade of our credit ratings by a credit rating agency, especially any downgrade to below investment grade, whether or not as a result of our actions or factors which are beyond our control, could increase our future borrowing costs and impair our ability to access capital and credit markets on terms commercially acceptable to us, or at all. In addition, any downgrade of our current short-term credit ratings could impair our ability to access the commercial paper market with the same flexibility that we have experienced historically, and therefore require us to rely more heavily on more expensive types of debt financing. See ""Our borrowing costs and access to capital and credit markets may be adversely affected by a downgrade or potential downgrade of our credit ratings."" in ""Item 1A. Risk Factors,"" ""Our Business Risks"" and Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements.

Reserves for uncertain tax positions are excluded from the table above as we are unable to reasonably predict the ultimate amount or timing of any such settlements. However, under the provisions of the TCJ Act, our provisional transition tax liability of approximately $4 billion, recorded in other liabilities on our balance sheet, must be paid over eight years. We expect to pay approximately $0.3 billion per year in 2019-2023, $0.6 billion in 2024, $0.9 billion in 2025 and $1.0 billion in 2026 and these amounts are excluded from the table above. (b) Excludes $4,020 million related to current maturities of debt, $3 million related to the fair value adjustments for debt acquired in acquisitions and interest rate swaps and payments of $155 million related to unamortized net discount. (c) Interest payments on floating-rate debt are estimated using interest rates effective as of December 30, 2017. (d) See Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on operating leases. (e) Primarily reflects non-cancelable commitments as of December 30, 2017. Long-term contractual commitments, except for our long-term debt obligations and provisional transition tax liability, are generally not recorded on our balance sheet. Operating leases primarily represent building leases. Non-cancelable purchasing commitments are primarily for oranges, orange juice and certain other commodities. Non-cancelable marketing commitments are primarily for sports marketing. Bottler funding to independent bottlers is not reflected in our long-term contractual commitments as it is negotiated on an annual basis. Accrued liabilities for pension and retiree medical plans are not reflected in our long-term contractual commitments. See Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our pension and retiree medical obligations. Off-Balance-Sheet Arrangements We do not have guarantees or other off-balance-sheet financing arrangements, including variable interest entities, that we believe could have a material impact on our financial condition or liquidity. We coordinate, on an aggregate basis, the contract negotiations of raw material requirements, including sweeteners, aluminum cans and plastic bottles and closures for us and certain of our independent bottlers. Once we have negotiated the contracts, the bottlers order and take delivery directly from the supplier and pay the suppliers directly. Consequently, transactions between our independent bottlers and suppliers are not reflected in our consolidated financial statements. As the contracting party, we could be liable to these suppliers in the event of any nonpayment by our independent bottlers, but we consider this exposure to be remote. 71 Table of Contents Return on Invested Capital ROIC is a non-GAAP financial measure.

These policies may require management to make difficult and subjective judgments regarding uncertainties, and as a result, such estimates may significantly impact our financial results. The precision of these estimates and the likelihood of future changes depend on a number of underlying variables and a range of possible outcomes. Other than our accounting for pension and retiree medical plans, our critical accounting policies do not involve a choice between alternative methods of accounting. With the exception of our provisional net tax expense related to the TCJ Act and the change in 2016 to the full yield approach to estimate the service and interest cost components for our pension and retiree medical plans described below, we applied our critical accounting policies and estimation methods consistently in all material respects, and for all periods presented. We have discussed our critical accounting policies with our Audit Committee. 72 Table of Contents Our critical accounting policies are:  revenue recognition;  goodwill and other intangible assets;  income tax expense and accruals; and  pension and retiree medical plans. Revenue Recognition We recognize revenue upon shipment or delivery to our customers based on written sales terms that do not allow for a right of return. However, our policy for DSD and certain chilled products is to remove and replace damaged and out-of-date products from store shelves to ensure that consumers receive the product quality and freshness they expect. Similarly, our policy for certain warehouse-distributed products is to replace damaged and out-of-date products. As a result, we record reserves, based on estimates, for anticipated damaged and out-of-date products. Our products are sold for cash or on credit terms. Our credit terms, which are established in accordance with local and industry practices, typically require payment within 30 days of delivery in the United States, and generally within 30 to 90 days internationally, and may allow discounts for early payment. We estimate and reserve for our bad debt exposure based on our experience with past due accounts and collectibility, the aging of accounts receivable and our analysis of customer data. Our policy is to provide customers with product when needed. In fact, our commitment to freshness and product dating serves to regulate the quantity of product shipped or delivered. In addition, DSD products are placed on the shelf by our employees with customer shelf space and storerooms limiting the quantity of product. For product delivered through other distribution networks, we monitor customer inventory levels. As discussed in ""Our Customers"" in ""Item 1. Business,"" we offer sales incentives and discounts through various programs to customers and consumers. Total marketplace spending includes sales incentives, discounts, advertising and other marketing activities. Sales incentives and discounts are primarily accounted for as a reduction of revenue and include payments to customers for performing activities on our behalf, such as payments for in-store displays, payments to gain distribution of new products, payments for shelf space and discounts to promote lower retail prices. Sales incentives and discounts also include support provided to our independent bottlers. See Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on our revenue recognition and related policies, including total marketplace spending, and the transition to the new revenue recognition guidance, which becomes effective in the first quarter of 2018. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets We sell products under a number of brand names, many of which were developed by us. Brand development costs are expensed as incurred. We also purchase brands and other intangible assets in acquisitions. In a business combination, the consideration is first assigned to identifiable assets and liabilities, including brands and other intangible assets, based on estimated fair values, with any excess recorded as goodwill. Determining fair value requires significant estimates and assumptions based on an evaluation of a number of factors, such as marketplace participants, product life cycles, market share, consumer awareness, brand history and future expansion expectations, amount and timing of future cash flows and the discount rate applied to the cash flows. We believe that a brand has an indefinite life if it has a history of strong revenue and cash flow performance 73 Table of Contents and we have the intent and ability to support the brand with marketplace spending for the foreseeable future. If these perpetual brand criteria are not met, brands are amortized over their expected useful lives, which generally range from 20 to 40 years. Determining the expected life of a brand requires management judgment and is based on an evaluation of a number of factors, including market share, consumer awareness, brand history, future expansion expectations and regulatory restrictions, as well as the macroeconomic environment of the countries in which the brand is sold. In connection with previous acquisitions, we reacquired certain franchise rights which provided the exclusive and perpetual rights to manufacture and/or distribute beverages for sale in specified territories. In determining the useful life of these franchise rights, many factors were considered, including the pre-existing perpetual bottling arrangements, the indefinite period expected for these franchise rights to contribute to our future cash flows, as well as the lack of any factors that would limit the useful life of these franchise rights to us, including legal, regulatory, contractual, competitive, economic or other factors. Therefore, certain of these franchise rights are considered as indefinite-lived, with the balance amortized over the remaining contractual period of the contract in which the right was granted. Indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized and are assessed for impairment at least annually, using either a qualitative or quantitative approach. We perform this annual assessment during our third quarter. Where we use the qualitative assessment, first we determine if, based on qualitative factors, it is more likely than not that an impairment exists. Factors considered include macroeconomic, industry and competitive conditions, legal and regulatory environment, historical financial performance and significant changes in the brand or reporting unit. If the qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that an impairment exists, then a quantitative assessment is performed. The quantitative assessment requires an analysis of several estimates including future cash flows or income consistent with management's strategic business plans, annual sales growth rates, perpetuity growth assumptions and the selection of assumptions underlying a discount rate (weighted-average cost of capital) based on market data available at the time. Significant management judgment is necessary to estimate the impact of competitive operating, macroeconomic and other factors to estimate future levels of sales, operating profit or cash flows. All assumptions used in our impairment evaluations for nonamortizable intangible assets, such as forecasted growth rates and weighted-average cost of capital, are based on the best available market information and are consistent with our internal forecasts and operating plans. These assumptions could be adversely impacted by certain of the risks described in ""Item 1A. Risk Factors"" and ""Our Business Risks."" Amortizable intangible assets are only evaluated for impairment upon a significant change in the operating or macroeconomic environment. If an evaluation of the undiscounted future cash flows indicates impairment, the asset is written down to its estimated fair value, which is based on its discounted future cash flows. See Note 2 and Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information. Income Tax Expense and Accruals Our annual tax rate is based on our income, statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Significant judgment is required in determining our annual tax rate and in evaluating our tax positions. We establish reserves when, despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable, we believe that certain positions are subject to challenge and that we likely will not succeed. We adjust these reserves, as well as the related interest, in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the progress of a tax audit. See ""Increases in income tax rates, changes in income tax laws or disagreements with tax authorities could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations."" in ""Item 1A. Risk Factors."" 74 Table of Contents An estimated annual effective tax rate is applied to our quarterly operating results. In the event there is a significant or unusual item recognized in our quarterly operating results, the tax attributable to that item is separately calculated and recorded at the same time as that item. We consider the tax adjustments from the resolution of prior year tax matters to be among such items. Tax law requires items to be included in our tax returns at different times than the items are reflected in our financial statements. As a result, our annual tax rate reflected in our financial statements is different than that reported in our tax returns (our cash tax rate). Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible in our tax return, and some differences reverse over time, such as depreciation expense. These temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in our tax returns in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in our income statement. We establish valuation allowances for our deferred tax assets if, based on the available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Deferred tax liabilities generally represent tax expense recognized in our financial statements for which payment has been deferred, or expense for which we have already taken a deduction in our tax return but have not yet recognized as expense in our financial statements. During the fourth quarter of 2017, the TCJ Act was enacted in the United States. Among its many provisions, the TCJ Act imposed a mandatory one-time transition tax on undistributed international earnings and reduced the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, effective January 1, 2018. As a result of the enactment of the TCJ Act, we recognized a provisional net tax expense of $2.5 billion in the fourth quarter of 2017. See further information in ""Items Affecting Comparability."" Included in the provisional net tax expense of $2.5 billion is a provisional mandatory one-time transition tax of approximately $4 billion on undistributed international earnings, included in other liabilities. This provisional mandatory one-time transition tax was partially offset by a provisional $1.5 billion benefit resulting from the required remeasurement of our deferred tax assets and liabilities to the new, lower U.S. corporate income tax rate, effective January 1, 2018. The effect of the remeasurement was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017, consistent with the enactment date of the TCJ Act and reflected in our provision for income taxes. The recorded impact of the TCJ Act is provisional and the final amount may differ, possibly materially, due to, among other things, changes in estimates, interpretations and assumptions we have made, changes in IRS interpretations, the issuance of new guidance, legislative actions, changes in accounting standards or related interpretations in response to the TCJ Act and future actions by states within the United States that have not currently adopted the TCJ Act. In 2017, our annual tax rate was 48.9% compared to 25.4% in 2016, as discussed in ""Other Consolidated Results."" The tax rate increased 23.5 percentage points compared to 2016, primarily as a result of the provisional net tax expense related to the TCJ Act, which contributed 26 percentage points to the increase, partially offset by the impact of the prior-year impairment charge to reduce the value of our 5% indirect equity interest in TAB to its estimated fair value, which had no corresponding tax benefit, as well as the impact of recognizing excess tax benefits in the provision for income taxes as a result of the changes in accounting for certain aspects of share-based payments to employees in the current year. See Note 2 and Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information. The TCJ Act is currently expected to reduce our annual tax rate, in percentage terms, to the low twenties in 2018. However, we continue to evaluate the impact of the TCJ Act on our annual tax rate due to certain provisions, such as the global intangible low-tax income (GILTI) provision which may impact our tax rate in future years. 75 Table of Contents Pension and Retiree Medical Plans Our pension plans cover certain employees in the United States and certain international employees. Benefits are determined based on either years of service or a combination of years of service and earnings. Certain U.S. and Canada retirees are also eligible for medical and life insurance benefits (retiree medical) if they meet age and service requirements. Generally, our share of retiree medical costs is capped at specified dollar amounts, which vary based upon years of service, with retirees contributing the remainder of the cost. In addition, we have been phasing out certain subsidies of retiree medical benefits. In 2016, we approved an amendment to reorganize the U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plans that resulted in the combination of two plans effective December 31, 2016, and the spinoff of a portion of the combined plan into a pre-existing plan effective January 1, 2017. The benefits offered to the plans' participants were unchanged. The result of the reorganization was the creation of Plan A and the PepsiCo Employees Retirement Plan I (Plan I). The reorganization was made to facilitate a targeted investment strategy over time and to provide additional flexibility in evaluating opportunities to reduce risk and volatility. Actuarial gains and losses associated with Plan A are amortized over the average remaining service life of the active participants, while the actuarial gains and losses associated with Plan I are amortized over the remaining life expectancy of the inactive participants. As a result of these changes, the pre-tax net periodic benefit cost decreased by $42 million ($27 million after-tax, reflecting tax rates effective for the 2017 tax year, or $0.02 per share) in 2017, primarily impacting corporate unallocated expenses. See Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements. In 2016, the U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plans purchased a group annuity contract whereby an unrelated insurance company assumed the obligation to pay and administer future annuity payments for certain retirees. In 2016, we made discretionary contributions of $452 million primarily to fund the transfer of the obligation. This transaction triggered a pre-tax settlement charge of $242 million ($162 million after-tax or $0.11 per share). See ""Items Affecting Comparability"" and Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements. Our Assumptions The determination of pension and retiree medical expenses and obligations requires the use of assumptions to estimate the amount of benefits that employees earn while working, as well as the present value of those benefits. Annual pension and retiree medical expense amounts are principally based on four components: (1) the value of benefits earned by employees for working during the year (service cost), (2) the increase in the projected benefit obligation due to the passage of time (interest cost), and (3) other gains and losses as discussed in Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements, reduced by (4) the expected return on assets for our funded plans. Significant assumptions used to measure our annual pension and retiree medical expenses include:  certain employee-related demographic factors, such as turnover, retirement age and mortality;  the expected return on assets in our funded plans;  for pension expense, the rate of salary increases for plans where benefits are based on earnings;  for retiree medical expense, health care cost trend rates; and  for pension and retiree medical expense, the spot rates along the yield curve used to determine the present value of liabilities and, beginning in 2016, to determine service and interest costs. Certain assumptions reflect our historical experience and management's best judgment regarding future expectations. All actuarial assumptions are reviewed annually, except in the case of an interim remeasurement due to a significant event such as a curtailment or settlement. Due to the significant management judgment 76 Table of Contents involved, our assumptions could have a material impact on the measurement of our pension and retiree medical expenses and obligations. At each measurement date, the discount rates are based on interest rates for high-quality, long-term corporate debt securities with maturities comparable to those of our liabilities. Our U.S. obligation and pension and retiree medical expense is based on the discount rates determined using the Mercer Above Mean Curve. This curve includes bonds that closely match the timing and amount of our expected benefit payments and reflects the portfolio of investments we would consider to settle our liabilities. Beginning 2016, we changed the method we use to estimate the service and interest cost components of net periodic benefit cost for our U.S. and the majority of our significant international pension and retiree medical plans. Historically, we estimated the service and interest cost components using a single weighted-average discount rate derived from the yield curve used to measure the projected benefit obligation (or accumulated post-retirement benefit obligation for the retiree medical plans) at the beginning of the period. We now use a full yield curve approach in the estimation of these components of benefit cost by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows. We have made this change to improve the correlation between projected benefit cash flows and the corresponding yield curve spot rates, which we believe will result in a more precise measurement of service and interest costs. This change does not affect the measurement of our benefit obligation. We have accounted for this change in estimate on a prospective basis as of the beginning of 2016. The pre-tax reduction in net periodic benefit cost associated with this change was $125 million ($81 million after-tax or $0.06 per share) for the full year 2016. See Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements for information about the expected rate of return on plan assets and our plans' investment strategy. Although we review our expected long-term rates of return on an annual basis, our asset returns in a given year do not significantly influence our evaluation of long-term rates of return. The health care trend rate used to determine our retiree medical plans' liability and expense is reviewed annually. Our review is based on our claims experience, information provided by our health plans and actuaries, and our knowledge of the health care industry. Our review of the trend rate considers factors such as demographics, plan design, new medical technologies and changes in medical carriers. Weighted-average assumptions for pension and retiree medical expense are as follows: 2018     2017     2016   Pension           Service cost discount rate  3.7 %   4.3 %   4.5 % Interest cost discount rate  3.2 %   3.5 %   3.8 % Expected rate of return on plan assets (a) 6.9 %   7.2 %   7.2 % Expected rate of salary increases 3.2 %   3.2 %   3.2 % Retiree medical           Service cost discount rate  3.6 %   4.0 %   4.3 % Interest cost discount rate  3.0 %   3.2 %   3.3 % Expected rate of return on plan assets (a) 6.5 %   7.5 %   7.5 % Current health care cost trend rate 5.8 %   5.9 %   6.0 % (a) Expected rate of return on plan assets in 2018 reflects a $1.4 billion contribution to Plan A in the United States that we intend to invest in fixed income securities, as well as our 2018 target investment allocations disclosed in Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements. In general, lower discount rates increase the size of the projected benefit obligation and pension expense in the following year, while higher discount rates reduce the size of the projected benefit obligation and pension expense. Based on our assumptions, we expect our total pension and retiree medical expense to remain 77 Table of Contents consistent in 2018 primarily driven by cost savings due to the recognition of prior experience gains on plan assets and the impact of approved plan contributions, partially offset by the change in discount rates. Sensitivity of Assumptions A decrease in each of the collective discount rates or in the expected rate of return assumptions would increase expense for our benefit plans. A 25-basis-point decrease in each of the above discount rates and expected rate of return assumptions would increase 2018 pre-tax pension and retiree medical expense as follows: Assumption   Amount   Discount rates used in the calculation of expense   $47 Expected rate of return   $42 See Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information about the sensitivity of our retiree medical cost assumptions. Funding We make contributions to pension trusts that provide plan benefits for certain pension plans. These contributions are made in accordance with applicable tax regulations that provide for current tax deductions for our contributions and taxation to the employee only upon receipt of plan benefits. Generally, we do not fund our pension plans when our contributions would not be currently tax deductible. As our retiree medical plans are not subject to regulatory funding requirements, we generally fund these plans on a pay-as-you-go basis, although we periodically review available options to make additional contributions toward these benefits. In February 2018, we received approval from our Board of Directors to make discretionary contributions of $1.4 billion to Plan A in the United States that we intend to invest in fixed income securities. As of February 13, 2018, we contributed $750 million of the approved amount; we expect to contribute the remaining $650 million in the first quarter of 2018. These contributions are reflected in our 2018 long-term expected rate of return on plan assets and target investment allocations. Our pension and retiree medical contributions are subject to change as a result of many factors, such as changes in interest rates, deviations between actual and expected asset returns and changes in tax or other benefit laws. We regularly evaluate different opportunities to reduce risk and volatility associated with our pension and retiree medical plans. See Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements for our past and expected contributions and estimated future benefit payments. 78 Table of Contents Consolidated Statement of Income PepsiCo, Inc. and Subsidiaries Fiscal years ended December 30, 2017, December 31, 2016 and December 26, 2015 (in millions except per share amounts) 2017     2016     2015   Net Revenue $ 63,525     $ 62,799     $ 63,056   Cost of sales 28,785     28,209     28,731   Gross profit 34,740     34,590     34,325   Selling, general and administrative expenses 24,231     24,805     24,613   Venezuela impairment charges  -

See accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements. 83 Table of Contents Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Note 1  -  Basis of Presentation and Our Divisions Basis of Presentation The accompanying financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and include the consolidated accounts of PepsiCo, Inc. and the affiliates that we control. In addition, we include our share of the results of certain other affiliates using the equity method based on our economic ownership interest, our ability to exercise significant influence over the operating or financial decisions of these affiliates or our ability to direct their economic resources. We do not control these other affiliates, as our ownership in these other affiliates is generally 50% or less. Intercompany balances and transactions are eliminated. Raw materials, direct labor and plant overhead, as well as purchasing and receiving costs, costs directly related to production planning, inspection costs and raw materials handling facilities, are included in cost of sales. The costs of moving, storing and delivering finished product are included in selling, general and administrative expenses. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Estimates are used in determining, among other items, sales incentives accruals, tax reserves, share-based compensation, pension and retiree medical accruals, amounts and useful lives for intangible assets and future cash flows associated with impairment testing for perpetual brands, goodwill and other long-lived assets. We evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis using our historical experience, as well as other factors we believe appropriate under the circumstances, such as current economic conditions, and adjust or revise our estimates as circumstances change. As future events and their effect cannot be determined with precision, actual results could differ significantly from these estimates. Effective as of the end of the third quarter of 2015, we deconsolidated our Venezuelan subsidiaries from our consolidated financial statements and began accounting for our investments in our wholly-owned Venezuelan subsidiaries and joint venture using the cost method of accounting. See subsequent discussion of ""Venezuela."" Our fiscal year ends on the last Saturday of each December, resulting in an additional week of results every five or six years. Our fiscal 2016 results included an extra week. While our North America results are reported on a weekly calendar basis, most of our international operations report on a monthly calendar basis. Certain operations in our ESSA segment report on a weekly calendar basis. The following chart details our quarterly reporting schedule: Quarter    United States and Canada    International First Quarter    12 weeks    January, February Second Quarter    12 weeks    March, April and May Third Quarter    12 weeks    June, July and August Fourth Quarter    16 weeks (17 weeks for 2016)    September, October, November and December See ""Our Divisions"" below, and for additional unaudited information on items affecting the comparability of our consolidated results, see further unaudited information in ""Items Affecting Comparability"" in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Unless otherwise noted, tabular dollars are in millions, except per share amounts. All per share amounts reflect common per share amounts, assume dilution unless otherwise noted, and are based on unrounded amounts. Certain reclassifications were made to the prior years' financial statements to conform to the current 84 Table of Contents year presentation, including the adoption of the recently issued accounting pronouncements disclosed in Note 2. Our Divisions Through our operations, authorized bottlers, contract manufacturers and other third parties, we make, market, distribute and sell a wide variety of convenient and enjoyable beverages, foods and snacks, serving customers and consumers in more than 200 countries and territories with our largest operations in North America, Mexico, Russia, the United Kingdom and Brazil. Division results are based on how our Chief Executive Officer assesses the performance of and allocates resources to our divisions and are considered our reportable segments. For additional unaudited information on our divisions, see ""Our Operations"" contained in ""Item 1. Business."" The accounting policies for the divisions are the same as those described in Note 2, except for the following allocation methodologies:  share-based compensation expense;  pension and retiree medical expense; and  derivatives. Share-Based Compensation Expense Our divisions are held accountable for share-based compensation expense and, therefore, this expense is allocated to our divisions as an incremental employee compensation cost. The allocation of share-based compensation expense in 2017 was approximately 13% to FLNA, 1% to QFNA, 18% to NAB, 7% to Latin America, 9% to ESSA, 9% to AMENA and 43% to corporate unallocated expenses. In 2016, the allocation of share-based compensation expense was approximately 14% to FLNA, 2% to QFNA, 22% to NAB, 7% to Latin America, 11% to ESSA, 10% to AMENA and 34% to corporate unallocated expenses. We had similar allocations of share-based compensation expense to our divisions in 2015. The expense allocated to our divisions excludes any impact of changes in our assumptions during the year which reflect market conditions over which division management has no control. Therefore, any variances between allocated expense and our actual expense are recognized in corporate unallocated expenses. Pension and Retiree Medical Expense Pension and retiree medical service costs measured at fixed discount rates, as well as amortization of costs related to certain pension plan amendments and gains and losses due to demographics (including mortality assumptions and salary experience) are reflected in division results. Division results also include interest costs, measured at fixed discount rates, for retiree medical plans. Interest costs for the pension plans, pension asset returns and the impact of pension funding, and gains and losses other than those due to demographics, are all reflected in corporate unallocated expenses. In addition, corporate unallocated expenses include the difference between the service costs included in division results and total service costs determined using the plans' discount rates as disclosed in Note 7. Derivatives We centrally manage commodity derivatives on behalf of our divisions. These commodity derivatives include agricultural products, energy and metals. Commodity derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment are marked to market each period with the resulting gains and losses recorded in corporate unallocated expenses as either cost of sales or selling, general and administrative expenses, depending on the underlying commodity. These gains and losses are subsequently reflected in division results when the divisions recognize the cost of the underlying commodity in operating profit. Therefore, the divisions realize the economic effects of the derivative without experiencing any resulting mark-to-market volatility, which remains in corporate unallocated expenses. These derivatives hedge underlying commodity price risk and were not entered into for trading or speculative purposes. 85 Table of Contents Net revenue and operating profit/(loss) of each division are as follows: Net Revenue   Operating Profit/(Loss)(a)    2017     2016     2015     2017     2016     2015   FLNA $ 15,798     $ 15,549     $ 14,782     $ 4,823     $ 4,659     $ 4,304   QFNA 2,503     2,564     2,543     642     653     560   NAB 20,936     21,312     20,618     2,707     2,959     2,785   Latin America 7,208     6,820     8,228     908     887     (206 ) ESSA 11,050     10,216     10,510     1,354     1,108     1,081   AMENA 6,030     6,338     6,375     1,073     619     941   Total division 63,525     62,799     63,056     11,507     10,885     9,465   Corporate unallocated  -       -       -      (998 )   (1,100 )   (1,112 )   $ 63,525     $ 62,799     $ 63,056     $ 10,509     $ 9,785     $ 8,353 (a) For further unaudited information on certain items that impacted our financial performance, see ""Item 6.

In 2017, the change in total Corporate assets was primarily due to an increase in short-term investments and cash and cash equivalents. Amortization of intangible assets and depreciation and other amortization of each division are as follows: Amortization of  Intangible Assets    Depreciation and Other Amortization   2017     2016     2015     2017     2016     2015   FLNA $ 7     $ 7     $ 7     $ 449     $ 435     $ 427   QFNA  -       -       -      47     50     51   NAB 31     37     38     780     809     813   Latin America 5     5     7     245     211     238   ESSA 22     18     20     329     321     353   AMENA 3     3     3     257     294     293   Total division 68     70     75     2,107     2,120     2,175   Corporate  -       -       -      194     178     166     $ 68     $ 70     $ 75     $ 2,301     $ 2,298     $ 2,341 86 Table of Contents Net revenue and long-lived assets by country are as follows:  Net Revenue   Long-Lived Assets(a)   2017     2016     2015     2017     2016   United States $ 36,546     $ 36,732     $ 35,266     $ 28,418     $ 28,382   Mexico 3,650     3,431     3,687     1,205     998   Russia (b) 3,232     2,648     2,797     4,708     4,373   Canada 2,691     2,692     2,677     2,739     2,499   United Kingdom 1,650     1,737     1,966     817     852   Brazil 1,427     1,305     1,289     777     796   All other countries  14,329     14,254     15,374     9,200     8,504     $ 63,525     $ 62,799     $ 63,056     $ 47,864     $ 46,404 (a) Long-lived assets represent property, plant and equipment, nonamortizable intangible assets, amortizable intangible assets and investments in noncontrolled affiliates. These assets are reported in the country where they are primarily used. (b) Change in net revenue and long-lived assets in 2017 primarily reflects appreciation of the Russian ruble. Venezuela Due to exchange restrictions and other conditions that significantly impact our ability to effectively manage our businesses in Venezuela and realize earnings generated by our Venezuelan businesses, effective at the end of the third quarter of 2015, we deconsolidated our Venezuelan subsidiaries and began accounting for our investments in our Venezuelan subsidiaries and joint venture using the cost method of accounting. We recorded pre- and after-tax charges of $1.4 billion in our income statement to reduce the value of the cost method investments to their estimated fair values, resulting in a full impairment. The factors that led to our conclusions at the end of the third quarter of 2015 continued to exist through the end of 2017. We do not have any guarantees related to our Venezuelan entities, and our ongoing contractual commitments to our Venezuelan businesses are not material. We will recognize income from dividends and sales of inventory to our Venezuelan entities, which have not been and are not expected to be material, to the extent cash in U.S. dollars is received. We have not received any cash in U.S. dollars from our Venezuelan entities since our deconsolidation at the end of the third quarter of 2015. We continue to monitor the conditions in Venezuela and their impact on our accounting and disclosures. For further unaudited information, see ""Our Business Risks,"" ""Items Affecting Comparability"" and ""Our Liquidity and Capital Resources"" in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Note 2  -  Our Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Recognition We recognize revenue upon shipment or delivery to our customers based on written sales terms that do not allow for a right of return. However, our policy for DSD and certain chilled products is to remove and replace damaged and out-of-date products from store shelves to ensure that consumers receive the product quality and freshness they expect. Similarly, our policy for certain warehouse-distributed products is to replace damaged and out-of-date products. As a result, we record reserves, based on estimates, for anticipated damaged and out-of-date products. Our products are sold for cash or on credit terms. Our credit terms, which are established in accordance with local and industry practices, typically require payment within 30 days of delivery in the United States, and generally within 30 to 90 days internationally, and may allow discounts for early payment. We estimate and reserve for our bad debt exposure based on our experience with past due accounts and collectibility, the aging of accounts receivable and our analysis of customer data. Bad debt expense is classified within selling, general and administrative expenses in our income statement. 87 Table of Contents We are exposed to concentration of credit risk from our major customers, including Walmart. In 2017, sales to Walmart (including Sam's) represented approximately 13% of our consolidated net revenue, including concentrate sales to our independent bottlers, which were used in finished goods sold by them to Walmart. We have not experienced credit issues with these customers. Total Marketplace Spending We offer sales incentives and discounts through various programs to customers and consumers. Total marketplace spending includes sales incentives, discounts, advertising and other marketing activities. Sales incentives and discounts are primarily accounted for as a reduction of revenue and include payments to customers for performing activities on our behalf, such as payments for in-store displays, payments to gain distribution of new products, payments for shelf space and discounts to promote lower retail prices. Sales incentives and discounts also include support provided to our independent bottlers. A number of our sales incentives, such as bottler funding to independent bottlers and customer volume rebates, are based on annual targets, and accruals are established during the year for the expected payout. These accruals are based on contract terms and our historical experience with similar programs and require management judgment with respect to estimating customer participation and performance levels. Differences between estimated expense and actual incentive costs are normally insignificant and are recognized in earnings in the period such differences are determined. In addition, certain advertising and marketing costs are also based on annual targets and recognized during the year as incurred. The terms of most of our incentive arrangements do not exceed a year, and, therefore, do not require highly uncertain long-term estimates. Certain arrangements, such as fountain pouring rights, may extend beyond one year. Up-front payments to customers under these arrangements are recognized over the shorter of the economic or contractual life, primarily as a reduction of revenue, and the remaining balances of $262 million as of December 30, 2017 and $291 million as of December 31, 2016 are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets and other assets on our balance sheet. For additional unaudited information on our sales incentives, see ""Our Customers"" in ""Item 1. Business"" and ""Our Critical Accounting Policies"" in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. For interim reporting, our policy is to allocate our forecasted full-year sales incentives for most of our programs to each of our interim reporting periods in the same year that benefits from the programs. The allocation methodology is based on our forecasted sales incentives for the full year and the proportion of each interim period's actual gross revenue or volume, as applicable, to our forecasted annual gross revenue or volume, as applicable. Based on our review of the forecasts at each interim period, any changes in estimates and the related allocation of sales incentives are recognized beginning in the interim period that they are identified. In addition, we apply a similar allocation methodology for interim reporting purposes for certain advertising and other marketing activities. Our annual financial statements are not impacted by this interim allocation methodology. Advertising and other marketing activities, reported as selling, general and administrative expenses, totaled $4.1 billion in 2017, $4.2 billion in 2016 and $3.9 billion in 2015, including advertising expenses of $2.4 billion in 2017, $2.5 billion in 2016 and $2.4 billion in 2015. Deferred advertising costs are not expensed until the year first used and consist of:  media and personal service prepayments;  promotional materials in inventory; and  production costs of future media advertising. Deferred advertising costs of $46 million and $32 million as of December 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively, are classified as prepaid expenses and other current assets on our balance sheet. 88 Table of Contents Distribution Costs Distribution costs, including the costs of shipping and handling activities, which include certain merchandising activities, are reported as selling, general and administrative expenses. Shipping and handling expenses were $9.9 billion in 2017, $9.7 billion in 2016 and $9.4 billion in 2015. Cash Equivalents Cash equivalents are highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less. Software Costs We capitalize certain computer software and software development costs incurred in connection with developing or obtaining computer software for internal use when both the preliminary project stage is completed and it is probable that the software will be used as intended. Capitalized software costs include(i) external direct costs of materials and services utilized in developing or obtaining computer software, (ii) compensation and related benefits for employees who are directly associated with the software projects and (iii) interest costs incurred while developing internal-use computer software. Capitalized software costs are included in property, plant and equipment on our balance sheet and amortized on a straight-line basis when placed into service over the estimated useful lives of the software, which approximate five to 10 years. Software amortization totaled $224 million in 2017, $214 million in 2016 and $202 million in 2015. Net capitalized software and development costs were $686 million and $791 million as of December 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively. Commitments and Contingencies We are subject to various claims and contingencies related to lawsuits, certain taxes and environmental matters, as well as commitments under contractual and other commercial obligations. We recognize liabilities for contingencies and commitments when a loss is probable and estimable. For additional unaudited information on our commitments, see ""Our Liquidity and Capital Resources"" in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Research and Development We engage in a variety of research and development activities and continue to invest to accelerate growth and to drive innovation globally. Consumer research is excluded from research and development costs and included in other marketing costs. Research and development costs were $737 million, $760 million and $754 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and are reported within selling, general and administrative expenses. See ""Research and Development"" in ""Item 1. Business"" for additional unaudited information about our research and development activities. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized and are assessed for impairment at least annually, using either a qualitative or quantitative approach. We perform this annual assessment during our third quarter. Where we use the qualitative assessment, first we determine if, based on qualitative factors, it is more likely than not that an impairment exists. Factors considered include macroeconomic, industry and competitive conditions, legal and regulatory environment, historical financial performance and significant changes in the brand or reporting unit. If the qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that an impairment exists, then a quantitative assessment is performed. In the quantitative assessment of indefinite-lived intangible assets, if the carrying amount of the indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its estimated fair value, as determined by its discounted cash flows, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. Quantitative assessment of goodwill is performed using a two-step impairment test at the reporting unit level. A reporting unit can be a division or 89 Table of Contents business within a division. The first step compares the carrying value of a reporting unit, including goodwill, with its estimated fair value, as determined by its discounted cash flows. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, we complete the second step to determine the amount of goodwill impairment loss that we should record, if any. In the second step, we determine an implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill by allocating the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities other than goodwill (including any unrecognized intangible assets). The amount of impairment loss is equal to the excess of the carrying value of the goodwill over the implied fair value of that goodwill. The quantitative assessment described above requires an analysis of several estimates including future cash flows or income consistent with management's strategic business plans, annual sales growth rates, perpetuity growth assumptions and the selection of assumptions underlying a discount rate (weighted average cost of capital) based on market data available at the time. Significant management judgment is necessary to estimate the impact of competitive operating, macroeconomic and other factors to estimate future levels of sales, operating profit or cash flows. All assumptions used in our impairment evaluations for nonamortizable intangible assets, such as forecasted growth rates and weighted-average cost of capital, are based on the best available market information and are consistent with our internal forecasts and operating plans. Amortizable intangible assets are only evaluated for impairment upon a significant change in the operating or macroeconomic environment. If an evaluation of the undiscounted future cash flows indicates impairment, the asset is written down to its estimated fair value, which is based on its discounted future cash flows. See also Note 4, and for additional unaudited information on goodwill and other intangible assets, see ""Our Critical Accounting Policies"" in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Other Significant Accounting Policies Our other significant accounting policies are disclosed as follows:  Basis of Presentation  -  Note 1 - Basis of Presentation for a description of our policies regarding use of estimates, basis of presentation and consolidation.  Property, Plant and Equipment  -  Note 4.  Income Taxes  -  Note 5, and for additional unaudited information, see ""Our Critical Accounting Policies"" in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.  Share-Based Compensation  -  Note 6.  Pension, Retiree Medical and Savings Plans  -  Note 7, and for additional unaudited information, see ""Our Critical Accounting Policies"" in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.  Financial Instruments  -  Note 9, and for additional unaudited information, see ""Our Business Risks"" in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.  Inventories  -  Note 13.

Adjustments resulting from translating net assets are reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive loss within common shareholders' equity as currency translation adjustment. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements - Adopted In 2017, the SEC issued guidance related to the TCJ Act which allows recording of provisional tax expense using a measurement period, not to exceed one year, when information necessary to complete the accounting 90 Table of Contents for the effects of the TCJ Act is not available. We elected to apply the measurement period provisions of this guidance to certain income tax effects of the TCJ Act when it became effective during our fourth quarter of 2017, resulting in a provisional net tax expense of $2.5 billion. This provisional net tax expense was recorded based on information available to us prior to the issuance of our 2017 consolidated financial statements, may be subject to further revision as disclosed in Note 5, and will be finalized no later than the end of 2018. In 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued guidance that changes the accounting for certain aspects of share-based payments to employees. We adopted the provisions of this guidance during our first quarter of 2017, resulting in the following impacts to our financial statements:  Income tax effects of vested or settled awards were recognized in the provision for income taxes on our income statement on a prospective basis. Previously, these tax effects were recorded on our equity statement in capital in excess of par value. For the year ended December 30, 2017, our excess tax benefits were $115 million, resulting in a $0.08 increase to diluted net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share. For the years ended December 31, 2016 and December 26, 2015, our excess tax benefits recognized were $110 million and $107 million, respectively. If we had applied this standard in 2016 and 2015, there would have been a $0.07 increase to diluted net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share for both years. The ongoing impact on our financial statements is dependent on the timing of when awards vest or are exercised, our tax rate and the intrinsic value when awards vest or are exercised.  Excess tax benefits are retrospectively presented within operating activities and withholding tax payments upon vesting of RSUs, PSUs and PEPunits are retrospectively presented within financing activities in the cash flow statement. The adoption resulted in an increase of $295 million, $269 million and $284 million in our operating cash flow with a corresponding decrease in our financing cash flow for the years ended December 30, 2017, December 31, 2016 and December 26, 2015, respectively. The guidance also allows for the employer to repurchase more of an employee's shares, up to the maximum statutory rate, for tax withholding purposes and not classify the award as a liability that requires valuation on a mark-to-market basis. Our accounting treatment for outstanding awards was not impacted by our adoption of this provision. In addition, the guidance allows for a policy election to account for forfeitures as they occur. We will continue to apply our policy of estimating forfeitures. In 2016, the FASB issued guidance that eliminates the requirement that an investor retrospectively apply equity method accounting for an investment originally accounted for by another method. The guidance requires that an equity method investor add the cost of acquiring the additional interest in the investee to the current basis of the investor's previously held interest and adopt the equity method of accounting as of the date the investor's ability to exercise significant influence over the investment is achieved. We adopted the provisions of this guidance prospectively during our first quarter of 2017; the adoption did not impact our financial statements. In 2015, the FASB issued guidance that requires companies to classify all deferred tax assets and liabilities as noncurrent on the balance sheet. We adopted the provisions of this guidance retrospectively during our first quarter of 2017, resulting in the reclassification of $639 million of deferred taxes from current to non-current on our balance sheet as of December 31, 2016. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements - Not Yet Adopted In 2017, the FASB issued guidance to amend and simplify the application of hedge accounting guidance to better portray the economic results of risk management activities in the financial statements. The guidance expands the ability to hedge nonfinancial and financial risk components, reduces complexity in fair value hedges of interest rate risk, eliminates the requirement to separately measure and report hedge ineffectiveness, as well as eases certain hedge effectiveness assessment requirements. The guidance is effective beginning 91 Table of Contents in 2019 with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of this guidance, including transition elections and required disclosures, on our financial statements and the timing of adoption. In 2017, the FASB issued guidance that requires companies to retrospectively present the service cost component of net periodic benefit cost for pension and retiree medical plans along with other compensation costs in operating profit and present the other components of net periodic benefit cost below operating profit in the income statement. The guidance also allows only the service cost component of net periodic benefit cost to be eligible for capitalization within inventory or fixed assets on a prospective basis. We will adopt the guidance when it becomes effective in the first quarter of 2018. We will also update our allocation of service costs to our divisions starting in 2018 to better approximate actual service cost. In connection with this adoption, we expect to record a decrease in operating profit of $233 million for the year ended December 30, 2017 and an increase in operating profit of $19 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily impacting selling, general and administrative expenses. See Note 7 for further information on our service cost and other components of net periodic benefit cost for pension and retiree medical plans. In 2016, the FASB issued guidance to clarify how restricted cash should be presented in the cash flow statement. We will adopt the guidance when it becomes effective in the first quarter of 2018. The guidance is not expected to have a material impact on our financial statements. In 2016, the FASB issued guidance that requires companies to account for the income tax effects of intercompany transfers of assets, other than inventory, when the transfer occurs versus deferring income tax effects until the transferred asset is sold to an outside party or otherwise recognized. We will adopt the guidance when it becomes effective in the first quarter of 2018. The guidance is not expected to have a material impact on our financial statements. In 2016, the FASB issued guidance that requires lessees to recognize most leases on the balance sheet, but record expenses on the income statement in a manner similar to current accounting. For lessors, the guidance modifies the classification criteria and the accounting for sales-type and direct financing leases. The guidance is effective beginning in 2019 with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of this guidance on our financial statements and related disclosures, including the increase in the assets and liabilities on our balance sheet and the impact on our current lease portfolio from both a lessor and lessee perspective. To facilitate this, we are utilizing a comprehensive approach to review our lease portfolio, as well as assessing system requirements and control implications. We have identified our significant leases by geography and by asset type that will be impacted by the new guidance, as well as a software tool to begin tracking the requirements of the guidance. In addition, we are currently evaluating the timing of adoption of this guidance. See Note 13 for our minimum lease payments under non-cancelable operating leases. In 2016, the FASB issued guidance that requires companies to measure investments in certain equity securities at fair value and recognize any changes in fair value in net income. We will adopt the guidance when it becomes effective in the first quarter of 2018. The guidance is not expected to have a material impact on our financial statements. In the second quarter of 2017, we sold our minority stake in Britvic, representing all of our available-for-sale equity securities, which reduced the risk and volatility of these investments in our income statement in the future. See Note 9 for further information on our available-for-sale securities. In 2014, the FASB issued guidance on revenue recognition, with final amendments issued in 2016. The guidance provides for a five-step model to determine the revenue recognized for the transfer of goods or services to customers that reflects the expected entitled consideration in exchange for those goods or services. It also provides clarification for principal versus agent considerations and identifying performance obligations. In addition, the FASB introduced practical expedients related to disclosures of remaining performance obligations, as well as other amendments related to guidance on collectibility, non-cash consideration and the presentation of sales and other similar taxes. Financial statement disclosures required under the guidance will enable users to understand the nature, amount, timing, judgments and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows relating to customer contracts. The two permitted transition methods under the 92 Table of Contents guidance are the full retrospective approach or a cumulative effect adjustment to the opening retained earnings in the year of adoption (cumulative effect approach). We will adopt the guidance using the cumulative effect approach when it becomes effective in the first quarter of 2018. We are utilizing a comprehensive approach to assess the impact of the guidance on our contract portfolio by reviewing our current accounting policies and practices to identify potential differences that would result from applying the new requirements to our revenue contracts, including evaluation of our performance obligations, principal versus agent considerations and variable consideration. We are substantially complete with our contract and business process reviews and implemented changes to our controls to support recognition and disclosures under the new guidance. As a result of implementing certain changes to our accounting policies upon adoption, we plan to record an adjustment to opening retained earnings to reflect marketplace spending that our customers and independent bottlers expect to be entitled to in line with revenue recognition; exclude all sales, use, value-added and certain excise taxes assessed by governmental authorities on revenue-producing transactions from net revenue and cost of sales; and to record shipping and handling activities that are performed after a customer obtains control of the product as a fulfillment cost. Based on the foregoing, we currently do not expect this guidance to have a material impact on our financial statements or disclosures. Note 3  -  Restructuring and Impairment Charges A summary of our restructuring and impairment charges and other productivity initiatives is as follows:  2017     2016     2015   2014 Productivity Plan $ 295     $ 160     $ 169   2012 Productivity Plan  -       -      61   Total restructuring and impairment charges 295     160     230   Other productivity initiatives 16     12     90   Total restructuring and impairment charges and other productivity initiatives $ 311     $ 172     $ 320 2014 Multi-Year Productivity Plan The 2014 Productivity Plan, publicly announced on February 13, 2014, includes the next generation of productivity initiatives that we believe will strengthen our food, snack and beverage businesses by: accelerating our investment in manufacturing automation; further optimizing our global manufacturing footprint, including closing certain manufacturing facilities; re-engineering our go-to-market systems in developed markets; expanding shared services; and implementing simplified organization structures to drive efficiency. To build on the successful implementation of the 2014 Productivity Plan to date, we expanded and extended the program through the end of 2019 to take advantage of additional opportunities within the initiatives described above to further strengthen our food, snack and beverage businesses. In 2017, 2016 and 2015, we incurred restructuring charges of $295 million ($224 million after-tax or $0.16 per share), $160 million ($131 million after-tax or $0.09 per share) and $169 million ($134 million after-tax 93 Table of Contents or $0.09 per share), respectively, in conjunction with our 2014 Productivity Plan. All of these charges were recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses and primarily relate to severance and other employee-related costs, asset impairments (all non-cash), and other costs associated with the implementation of our initiatives, including contract termination costs. Substantially all of the restructuring accrual at December 30, 2017 is expected to be paid by the end of 2018.

Note 4  -  Property, Plant and Equipment and Intangible Assets A summary of our property, plant and equipment is as follows: Average Useful Life (Years)   2017     2016     2015   Property, plant and equipment, net               Land      $ 1,148     $ 1,153       Buildings and improvements 15 - 44   8,796     8,306       Machinery and equipment, including fleet and software 5 - 15   27,018     25,277       Construction in progress     2,144     2,082             39,106     36,818       Accumulated depreciation     (21,866 )   (20,227 )           $ 17,240     $ 16,591       Depreciation expense     $ 2,227     $ 2,217     $ 2,248 Property, plant and equipment is recorded at historical cost. Depreciation and amortization are recognized on a straight-line basis over an asset's estimated useful life. Land is not depreciated and construction in progress is not depreciated until ready for service.

In these circumstances, if an evaluation of the undiscounted cash flows indicates impairment, the asset is written down to its estimated fair value, which is based on discounted future cash flows. Useful lives are periodically evaluated to determine whether events or circumstances have occurred which indicate the need for revision. For additional unaudited information on our policies for amortizable brands, see ""Our Critical Accounting Policies"" in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Nonamortizable Intangible Assets We did not recognize any impairment charges for goodwill in each of the fiscal years ended December 30, 2017, December 31, 2016 and December 26, 2015. We recognized no material impairment charges for nonamortizable intangible assets in each of the fiscal years ended December 30, 2017, December 31, 2016 and December 26, 2015. As of December 30, 2017, the estimated fair values of our indefinite-lived reacquired and acquired franchise rights recorded at NAB exceeded their carrying values. However, there could be an impairment of the carrying value of NAB's reacquired and acquired franchise rights if future revenues and their contribution to the operating results of NAB's CSD business do not achieve our expected future cash flows or if macroeconomic conditions result in a future increase in the weighted-average cost of capital used to estimate fair value. We have also analyzed the impact of the macroeconomic conditions in Russia and Brazil on the estimated fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets in these countries and have concluded that there is no impairment as of December 30, 2017. However, there could be an impairment of the carrying value of certain brands in these countries if there is a deterioration in these conditions, if future revenues and their contributions to the operating results do not achieve our expected future cash flows or if macroeconomic conditions result in a future increase in the weighted-average cost of capital used to estimate fair value.

Among its many provisions, the TCJ Act imposed a mandatory one-time transition tax on undistributed international earnings and reduced the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, effective January 1, 2018. As a result of the enactment of the TCJ Act, we recognized a provisional net tax expense of $2.5 billion in the fourth quarter of 2017. See further unaudited information in ""Items Affecting Comparability"" in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Included in the provisional net tax expense of $2.5 billion is a provisional mandatory one-time transition tax of approximately $4 billion on undistributed international earnings, included in other liabilities. This provisional mandatory one-time transition tax was partially offset by a provisional $1.5 billion benefit resulting from the required remeasurement of our deferred tax assets and liabilities to the new, lower U.S. corporate income tax rate, effective January 1, 2018. The effect of the remeasurement was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017, consistent with the enactment date of the TCJ Act, and reflected in our provision for income taxes. 99 Table of Contents The TCJ Act also creates a new requirement that certain income earned by foreign subsidiaries, known as GILTI, must be included in the gross income of their U.S. shareholder. The FASB allows an accounting policy election of either recognizing deferred taxes for temporary differences expected to reverse as GILTI in future years or recognizing such taxes as a current-period expense when incurred. Due to the complexity of calculating GILTI under the new law, we have not determined which method we will apply. Therefore, we have not made any adjustments related to potential GILTI tax in our financial statements. We expect to elect an accounting policy in the first quarter of 2018. The components of the provisional net tax expense recorded in 2017 are based on currently available information and additional information needs to be prepared, obtained and/or analyzed to determine the final amounts. The provisional tax expense for the mandatory repatriation of undistributed international earnings will require further analysis of certain foreign exchange gains or losses, substantiation of foreign tax credits, as well as estimated cash and cash equivalents as of November 30, 2018, the tax year-end of our foreign subsidiaries. The provisional tax benefit for the remeasurement of deferred taxes will require additional information necessary for the preparation of our U.S. federal tax return, and further analysis and interpretation of certain provisions of the TCJ Act impacting deferred taxes, for example 100% expensing of qualified assets as well as our accounting policy election for recognizing deferred taxes for GILTI, could impact our deferred tax balance as of December 30, 2017. Tax effects for these items will be recorded in subsequent quarters, as discrete adjustments to our income tax provision, once complete. The SEC has issued guidance that allows for a measurement period of up to one year after the enactment date of the TCJ Act to finalize the recording of the related tax impacts. We currently anticipate finalizing and recording any resulting adjustments by the end of 2018. The recorded impact of the TCJ Act is provisional and the final amount may differ, possibly materially, due to, among other things, changes in estimates, interpretations and assumptions we have made, changes in IRS interpretations, the issuance of new guidance, legislative actions, changes in accounting standards or related interpretations in response to the TCJ Act and future actions by states within the United States that have not currently adopted the TCJ Act.

Reserves A number of years may elapse before a particular matter, for which we have established a reserve, is audited and finally resolved. The number of years with open tax audits varies depending on the tax jurisdiction. Our major taxing jurisdictions and the related open tax audits are as follows: Jurisdiction   Years Open to Audit   Years Currently Under Audit United States   2012-2016   2012-2013 Mexico   2014-2016   2014 United Kingdom   2014-2016   None Canada (Domestic)   2013-2016   2013-2014 Canada (International)   2010-2016   2010-2014 Russia   2012-2016   2012-2016 While it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular tax matter, we believe that our reserves reflect the probable outcome of known tax contingencies. We adjust these reserves, as well as the related interest, in light of changing facts and circumstances. Settlement of any 101 Table of Contents particular issue would usually require the use of cash. Favorable resolution would be recognized as a reduction to our annual tax rate in the year of resolution. For further unaudited information on the impact of the resolution of open tax issues, see ""Other Consolidated Results"" in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. In 2015, we reached an agreement with the IRS resolving substantially all open matters related to the audits of taxable years 2010 and 2011. The agreement resulted in a 2015 non-cash tax benefit totaling $230 million. As of December 30, 2017, the total gross amount of reserves for income taxes, reported in other liabilities, was $2.2 billion. We accrue interest related to reserves for income taxes in our provision for income taxes and any associated penalties are recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses. The gross amount of interest accrued, reported in other liabilities, was $283 million as of December 30, 2017, of which $89 million of expense was recognized in 2017. The gross amount of interest accrued, reported in other liabilities, was $193 million as of December 31, 2016, of which $61 million of expense was recognized in 2016. A reconciliation of unrecognized tax benefits, is as follows: 2017     2016   Balance, beginning of year $ 1,885     $ 1,547   Additions for tax positions related to the current year 309     349   Additions for tax positions from prior years 86     139   Reductions for tax positions from prior years (51 )   (70 ) Settlement payments (4 )   (26 ) Statutes of limitations expiration (33 )   (27 ) Translation and other 20     (27 ) Balance, end of year $ 2,212     $ 1,885 Carryforwards and Allowances Operating loss carryforwards totaling $12.6 billion at year-end 2017 are being carried forward in a number of foreign and state jurisdictions where we are permitted to use tax operating losses from prior periods to reduce future taxable income. These operating losses will expire as follows: $0.2 billion in 2018, $11.1 billion between 2019 and 2037 and $1.3 billion may be carried forward indefinitely. We establish valuation allowances for our deferred tax assets if, based on the available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Undistributed International Earnings As of December 30, 2017, we had approximately $42.5 billion of undistributed international earnings. We intend to repatriate approximately $20 billion of our foreign earnings back to the United States and have recognized all tax expense on these earnings in the fourth quarter of 2017. We intend to continue to reinvest the remaining $22.5 billion of earnings outside the United States for the foreseeable future and while U.S. federal tax expense has been recognized as a result of the TCJ Act, no deferred tax liabilities with respect to items such as certain foreign exchange gains or losses, foreign withholding taxes or state taxes have been recognized. It is not practicable for us to determine the amount of unrecognized tax expense on these reinvested international earnings. Note 6  -  Share-Based Compensation Our share-based compensation program is designed to attract and retain employees while also aligning employees' interests with the interests of our shareholders. PepsiCo has granted stock options, RSUs, PSUs, PEPunits and long-term cash awards to employees under the shareholder-approved PepsiCo, Inc. Long-Term 102 Table of Contents Incentive Plan (LTIP). Executives who are awarded long-term incentives based on their performance may generally elect to receive their grant in the form of stock options or RSUs, or a combination thereof. Executives who elect stock options receive four stock options for every one RSU that would have otherwise been granted. Certain executive officers and other senior executives do not have a choice and, beginning in 2016, were granted 66% PSUs and 34% long-term cash, each of which are subject to pre-established performance targets. Previously, they were granted a combination of 60% PEPunits measuring both absolute and relative stock price performance and 40% long-term cash based on achievement of specific performance operating metrics. The Company may use authorized and unissued shares to meet share requirements resulting from the exercise of stock options and the vesting of RSUs, PSUs and PEPunits. As of December 30, 2017, 74 million shares were available for future share-based compensation grants under the LTIP. The following table summarizes our total share-based compensation expense: 2017     2016     2015   Share-based compensation expense - equity awards $ 292     $ 284     $ 295   Share-based compensation expense - liability awards 13     5      -    Restructuring and impairment (credits)/charges (2 )   5     4   Total  $ 303     $ 294     $ 299   Income tax benefits recognized in earnings related to share-based compensation $ 89   (a) $ 91     $ 77 (a) Reflects tax rates effective for the 2017 tax year. As of December 30, 2017, there was $314 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested share-based compensation grants. This unrecognized compensation cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of two years. Method of Accounting and Our Assumptions The fair value of share-based award grants is amortized to expense over the vesting period, primarily three years. Awards to employees eligible for retirement prior to the award becoming fully vested are amortized to expense over the period through the date that the employee first becomes eligible to retire and is no longer required to provide service to earn the award. In addition, we use historical data to estimate forfeiture rates and record share-based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest. We do not backdate, reprice or grant share-based compensation awards retroactively. Repricing of awards would require shareholder approval under the LTIP. Stock Options A stock option permits the holder to purchase shares of PepsiCo common stock at a specified price. We account for our employee stock options under the fair value method of accounting using a Black-Scholes valuation model to measure stock option expense at the date of grant. All stock option grants have an exercise price equal to the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant and generally have a 10-year term. 103 Table of Contents Our weighted-average Black-Scholes fair value assumptions are as follows: 2017     2016     2015   Expected life 5 years     6 years     7 years   Risk-free interest rate 2.0 %   1.4 %   1.8 % Expected volatility 11 %   12 %   15 % Expected dividend yield 2.7 %   2.7 %   2.7 % The expected life is the period over which our employee groups are expected to hold their options. It is based on our historical experience with similar grants. The risk-free interest rate is based on the expected U.S. Treasury rate over the expected life. Volatility reflects movements in our stock price over the most recent historical period equivalent to the expected life. Dividend yield is estimated over the expected life based on our stated dividend policy and forecasts of net income, share repurchases and stock price. A summary of our stock option activity for the year ended December 30, 2017 is as follows: Options(a)   Weighted-Average Exercise Price   Weighted-Average Contractual Life Remaining (years)   Aggregate Intrinsic Value(b) Outstanding at December 31, 2016 25,190     $ 69.88           Granted 1,481     $ 110.15           Exercised (7,136 )   $ 65.31           Forfeited/expired (522 )   $ 88.36           Outstanding at December 30, 2017 19,013     $ 74.23     4.22   $ 868,750   Exercisable at December 30, 2017 14,589     $ 65.60     3.02   $ 792,560   Expected to vest as of December 30, 2017 3,994     $ 102.50     8.15   $ 69,578 (a) Options are in thousands and include options previously granted under the PBG plan. No additional options or shares were granted under the PBG plan after 2009. (b) In thousands. Restricted Stock Units and Performance Stock Units Each RSU represents our obligation to deliver to the holder one share of PepsiCo common stock when the award vests at the end of the service period. PSUs are awards pursuant to which a number of shares are delivered to the holder upon vesting at the end of the service period based on PepsiCo's performance against specified financial and/or operational performance metrics. The number of shares may be increased to the maximum or reduced to the minimum threshold based on the results of these performance metrics in accordance with the terms established at the time of the award. During the vesting period, RSUs and PSUs accrue dividend equivalents that pay out in cash (without interest) if and when the applicable RSU or PSU vests and becomes payable. The fair value of RSUs is measured at the market price of the Company's stock on the date of grant. The fair value of PSUs is measured at the market price of the Company's stock on the date of grant with the exception of awards with market conditions, for which we use the Monte-Carlo simulation model to determine the fair value. The Monte-Carlo simulation model uses the same input assumptions as the Black-Scholes model; however, it also further incorporates into the fair-value determination the possibility that the market condition may not be satisfied. Compensation costs related to these awards are recognized regardless of whether the market condition is satisfied, provided that the requisite service has been provided. 104 Table of Contents A summary of our RSU and PSU activity for the year ended December 30, 2017 is as follows: RSUs/PSUs(a)   Weighted-Average Grant-Date Fair Value   Weighted-Average Contractual Life Remaining (years)   Aggregate Intrinsic Value(a) Outstanding at December 31, 2016 8,237     $ 91.81           Granted (b) 2,824     $ 109.92           Converted (3,226 )   $ 82.56           Forfeited (608 )   $ 100.17           Actual performance change (c) 66     $ 100.33           Outstanding at December 30, 2017 (d) 7,293     $ 102.30     1.33   $ 874,517   Expected to vest as of December 30, 2017 6,695     $ 102.00     1.26   $ 802,826 (a) In thousands.

As of December 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, there were approximately 250,000 and 254,000 outstanding awards, respectively, consisting primarily of phantom stock units that were granted under the PepsiCo Director Deferral Program and will be settled in shares of PepsiCo common stock pursuant to the LTIP at the end of the applicable deferral period, not included in the tables above. Note 7  -  Pension, Retiree Medical and Savings Plans Effective January 1, 2017, the U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plans were reorganized into Plan A and Plan I. Actuarial gains and losses associated with Plan A are amortized over the average remaining service 106 Table of Contents life of the active participants, while the actuarial gains and losses associated with Plan I are amortized over the remaining life expectancy of the inactive participants. As a result of this change, the pre-tax net periodic benefit cost decreased by $42 million ($27 million after-tax, reflecting tax rates effective for the 2017 tax year, or $0.02 per share) in 2017, primarily impacting corporate unallocated expenses. See ""Our Critical Accounting Policies"" in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. In 2016, the U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plans purchased a group annuity contract whereby an unrelated insurance company assumed the obligation to pay and administer future annuity payments for certain retirees. In 2016, we made discretionary contributions of $452 million primarily to fund the transfer of the obligation. This transaction triggered a pre-tax settlement charge of $242 million ($162 million after-tax or $0.11 per share). See additional unaudited information in ""Items Affecting Comparability"" in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Effective as of the beginning of 2016, we prospectively changed the method we use to estimate the service and interest cost components of net periodic benefit cost. The pre-tax reduction in net periodic benefit cost associated with this change in 2016 was $125 million ($81 million after-tax or $0.06 per share). See ""Our Critical Accounting Policies"" in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for further unaudited information on this change in accounting estimate. Gains and losses resulting from actual experience differing from our assumptions, including the difference between the actual return on plan assets and the expected return on plan assets, as well as changes in our assumptions, are determined at each measurement date. These differences are recognized as a component of net gain or loss in accumulated other comprehensive loss. If this net accumulated gain or loss exceeds 10% of the greater of the market-related value of plan assets or plan liabilities, a portion of the net gain or loss is included in expense for the following year based upon the average remaining service life for participants in Plan A (approximately 11 years) and retiree medical (approximately 7 years), or the remaining life expectancy for participants in Plan I (approximately 27 years). The cost or benefit of plan changes that increase or decrease benefits for prior employee service (prior service (credit)/cost) is included in earnings on a straight-line basis over the average remaining service life for participants in Plan A or the remaining life expectancy for participants in Plan I. We regularly evaluate different opportunities to reduce risk and volatility associated with our pension and retiree medical plans. 107 Table of Contents Selected financial information for our pension and retiree medical plans is as follows: Pension   Retiree Medical   U.S.   International           2017     2016     2017     2016     2017     2016   Change in projected benefit liability                       Liability at beginning of year $ 13,192     $ 13,033     $ 3,124     $ 2,872     $ 1,208     $ 1,300   Service cost 401     393     91     80     28     31   Interest cost 468     484     89     94     36     41   Plan amendments 10     18     2      -      (5 )   (15 ) Participant contributions  -       -      2     2      -       -    Experience loss/(gain) 1,529     614     5     560     21     (51 ) Benefit payments (825 )   (347 )   (104 )   (83 )   (107 )   (100 ) Settlement/curtailment  (58 )   (1,014 )   (22 )   (19 )    -       -    Special termination benefits 60     11      -      1     2     1   Other, including foreign currency adjustment  -       -      303     (383 )   4     1   Liability at end of year $ 14,777     $ 13,192     $ 3,490     $ 3,124     $ 1,187     $ 1,208                           Change in fair value of plan assets                       Fair value at beginning of year $ 11,458     $ 11,397     $ 2,894     $ 2,823     $ 320     $ 354   Actual return on plan assets 1,935     880     288     409     52     30   Employer contributions/funding 60     541     104     118     56     36   Participant contributions  -       -      2     2      -       -    Benefit payments (825 )   (347 )   (104 )   (83 )   (107 )   (100 ) Settlement (46 )   (1,013 )   (18 )   (22 )    -       -    Other, including foreign currency adjustment  -       -      294     (353 )    -       -    Fair value at end of year $ 12,582     $ 11,458     $ 3,460     $ 2,894     $ 321     $ 320   Funded status $ (2,195 )   $ (1,734 )   $ (30 )   $ (230 )   $ (866 )   $ (888 ) Amounts recognized                       Other assets $ 286     $  -      $ 85     $ 51     $  -      $  -    Other current liabilities (74 )   (42 )   (1 )   (1 )   (75 )   (54 ) Other liabilities (2,407 )   (1,692 )   (114 )   (280 )   (791 )   (834 ) Net amount recognized $ (2,195 )   $ (1,734 )   $ (30 )   $ (230 )   $ (866 )   $ (888 )                         Amounts included in accumulated other comprehensive loss (pre-tax)                 Net loss/(gain) $ 3,520     $ 3,220     $ 782     $ 884     $ (189 )   $ (193 ) Prior service cost/(credit) 29     20     (3 )   (5 )   (71 )   (91 ) Total $ 3,549     $ 3,240     $ 779     $ 879     $ (260 )   $ (284 )                         Changes recognized in net loss/(gain) included in other comprehensive loss     Net loss/(gain) arising in current year $ 431     $ 568     $ (115 )   $ 314     $ (9 )   $ (57 ) Amortization and settlement recognition (131 )   (413 )   (60 )   (46 )   12     1   Foreign currency translation loss/(gain)  -       -      73     (117 )   1     1   Total $ 300     $ 155     $ (102 )   $ 151     $ 4     $ (55 )                         Accumulated benefit obligation at end of year $ 13,732     $ 12,211     $ 2,985     $ 2,642 The amounts we report as pension and retiree medical cost consist of the following components:  Service cost is the value of benefits earned by employees for working during the year.  Interest cost is the accrued interest on the projected benefit obligation due to the passage of time. 108 Table of Contents  Expected return on plan assets is the long-term return we expect to earn on plan investments for our funded plans that will be used to settle future benefit obligations.  Amortization of prior service cost/(credit) represents the recognition in the income statement of benefit changes resulting from plan amendments.  Amortization of net loss/(gain) represents the recognition in the income statement of changes in the amount of plan assets and the projected benefit obligation based on changes in assumptions and actual experience.  Settlement/curtailment loss/(gain) represents the result of actions that effectively eliminate all or a portion of related projected benefit obligations. Settlements are triggered when payouts to settle the projected benefit obligation of a plan due to lump sums or other events exceed the annual service and interest cost. Settlements are recognized when actions are irrevocable and we are relieved of the primary responsibility and risk for projected benefit obligations. Curtailments are due to events such as plant closures or the sale of a business resulting in a reduction of future service or benefits. Curtailment losses are recognized when an event is probable and estimable, while curtailment gains are recognized when an event has occurred (when the related employees terminate or an amendment is adopted).  Special termination benefits are the additional benefits offered to employees upon departure due to actions such as restructuring.

Future Benefit Payments Our estimated future benefit payments are as follows: 2018     2019     2020     2021     2022     2023 - 27   Pension $ 890     $ 985     $ 825     $ 875     $ 925     $ 5,210   Retiree medical (a) $ 120     $ 120     $ 110     $ 110     $ 105     $ 455 (a) Expected future benefit payments for our retiree medical plans do not reflect any estimated subsidies expected to be received under the 2003 Medicare Act. Subsidies are expected to be approximately $2 million for each of the years from 2018 through 2022 and approximately $6 million in total for 2023 through 2027. These future benefit payments to beneficiaries include payments from both funded and unfunded plans. 110 Table of Contents Funding Contributions to our pension and retiree medical plans were as follows: Pension   Retiree Medical   2017     2016     2015     2017     2016     2015   Discretionary (a) $ 6     $ 459     $  -      $  -      $  -      $  -    Non-discretionary 158     200     162     56     36     43   Total $ 164     $ 659     $ 162     $ 56     $ 36     $ 43 (a) Includes $452 million in 2016 relating to the funding of the group annuity contract purchase from an unrelated insurance company. In February 2018, we received approval from our Board of Directors to make discretionary contributions of $1.4 billion to Plan A in the United States that we intend to invest in fixed income securities. As of February 13, 2018, we contributed $750 million of the approved amount; we expect to contribute the remaining $650 million in the first quarter of 2018. These contributions are reflected in our 2018 long-term expected rate of return on plan assets and target investment allocations. In addition, in 2018, we expect to make non-discretionary contributions of approximately $175 million to our U.S. and international plans for pension benefits and approximately $75 million for retiree medical benefits. Plan Assets Our pension plan investment strategy includes the use of actively managed accounts and is reviewed periodically in conjunction with plan liabilities, an evaluation of market conditions, tolerance for risk and cash requirements for benefit payments. This strategy is also applicable to funds held for the retiree medical plans. Our investment objective includes ensuring that funds are available to meet the plans' benefit obligations when they become due. Assets contributed to our pension plans are no longer controlled by us, but become the property of our individual pension plans. However, we are indirectly impacted by changes in these plan assets as compared to changes in our projected liabilities. Our overall investment policy is to prudently invest plan assets in a well-diversified portfolio of equity and high-quality debt securities and real estate to achieve our long-term return expectations. Our investment policy also permits the use of derivative instruments, such as futures and forward contracts, to reduce interest rate and foreign currency risks. Futures contracts represent commitments to purchase or sell securities at a future date and at a specified price. Forward contracts consist of currency forwards. For 2018 and 2017, our expected long-term rate of return on U.S. plan assets is 7.2% and 7.5%, respectively. Our target investment allocations for U.S. plan assets are as follows: 2018     2017   Fixed income 47 %   40 % U.S. equity 29 %   33 % International equity 20 %   22 % Real estate 4 %   5 % Actual investment allocations may vary from our target investment allocations due to prevailing market conditions. We regularly review our actual investment allocations and periodically rebalance our investments. The expected return on plan assets is based on our investment strategy and our expectations for long-term rates of return by asset class, taking into account volatility and correlation among asset classes and our historical experience. We also review current levels of interest rates and inflation to assess the reasonableness of the long-term rates. We evaluate our expected return assumptions annually to ensure that they are reasonable. To calculate the expected return on plan assets, our market-related value of assets for fixed income is the actual fair value. For all other asset categories, such as equity securities, we use a method that recognizes 111 Table of Contents investment gains or losses (the difference between the expected and actual return based on the market-related value of assets) over a five-year period. This has the effect of reducing year-to-year volatility. Plan assets measured at fair value as of fiscal year-end 2017 and 2016 are categorized consistently by level, and are as follows: 2017   2016   Total   Quoted Prices in Active Markets for Identical Assets (Level 1)   Significant Other Observable Inputs (Level 2)   Significant Unobservable Inputs (Level 3)   Total U.S. plan assets (a)                   Equity securities, including preferred stock (b) $ 6,904     $ 6,896     $ 8     $  -      $ 6,489   Government securities (c) 1,365      -      1,365      -      1,173   Corporate bonds (c) 3,429      -      3,429      -      3,012   Mortgage-backed securities (c) 217      -      217      -      187   Contracts with insurance companies (d) 8      -       -      8     7   Cash and cash equivalents 236     236      -       -      196   Sub-total U.S. plan assets 12,159     $ 7,132     $ 5,019     $ 8     11,064   Real estate commingled funds measured at net asset value (e) 675                 651   Dividends and interest receivable, net of payables 69                 63   Total U.S. plan assets $ 12,903                 $ 11,778   International plan assets                   Equity securities (b) $ 1,928     $ 1,895     $ 33     $  -      $ 1,556   Government securities (c) 492      -      492      -      432   Corporate bonds (c) 493      -      493      -      453   Fixed income commingled funds (f) 383     383      -       -      316   Contracts with insurance companies (d) 36      -       -      36     35   Cash and cash equivalents 19     19      -       -      12   Sub-total international plan assets 3,351     $ 2,297     $ 1,018     $ 36     2,804   Real estate commingled funds measured at net asset value (e) 102                 84   Dividends and interest receivable 7                 6   Total international plan assets $ 3,460                 $ 2,894 (a) 2017 and 2016 amounts include $321 million and $320 million, respectively, of retiree medical plan assets that are restricted for purposes of providing health benefits for U.S. retirees and their beneficiaries. (b) The equity securities portfolio was invested in U.S. and international common stock and commingled funds, and the preferred stock portfolio in the U.S. was invested in domestic and international corporate preferred stock investments. The common stock is based on quoted prices in active markets. The U.S. commingled funds are based on fair values of the investments owned by these funds that are benchmarked against various U.S. large, mid-cap and small company indices, and includes one large-cap fund that represents 19% of total U.S. plan assets for 2017 and 2016. The international commingled funds are based on the fair values of the investments owned by these funds that track various non-U.S. equity indices. The preferred stock investments are based on quoted bid prices for comparable securities in the marketplace and broker/dealer quotes in active markets. (c) These investments are based on quoted bid prices for comparable securities in the marketplace and broker/dealer quotes in active markets. Corporate bonds of U.S.-based companies represent 23% and 22% of total U.S. plan assets for 2017 and 2016, respectively. (d) Based on the fair value of the contracts as determined by the insurance companies using inputs that are not observable. The changes in Level 3 amounts were not significant in the years ended December 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016. (e) The real estate commingled funds include investments in limited partnerships. These funds are based on the net asset value of the appraised value of investments owned by these funds as determined by independent third parties using inputs that are not observable. The majority of the funds are redeemable quarterly subject to availability of cash and have notice periods ranging from 45 to 90 days. (f) Based on the fair value of the investments owned by these funds that track various government and corporate bond indices. 112 Table of Contents Retiree Medical Cost Trend Rates 2018   2017 Average increase assumed 6 %   6 % Ultimate projected increase  5 %   5 % Year of ultimate projected increase 2039     2039 These assumed health care cost trend rates have an impact on the retiree medical plan expense and liability, however the cap on our share of retiree medical costs limits the impact.

The plans are designed to help employees accumulate additional savings for retirement, and we make Company matching contributions for certain employees on a portion of eligible pay based on years of service. Certain U.S. salaried employees, who are not eligible to participate in a defined benefit pension plan, are also eligible to receive an employer contribution to the 401(k) savings plan based on age and years of service regardless of employee contribution. In 2017, 2016 and 2015, our total Company contributions were $176 million, $164 million and $148 million, respectively.

(b) The interest rates presented reflect weighted-average rates at year-end. Certain of our fixed rate indebtedness have been swapped to floating rates through the use of interest rate derivative instruments. See Note 9 for additional information regarding our interest rate derivative instruments. In 2017, we issued the following senior notes: Interest Rate     Maturity Date   Amount(a)     Floating rate     May 2019   $ 350     Floating rate     May 2022   $ 400     1.550 %   May 2019   $ 750     2.250 %   May 2022   $ 750     4.000 %   May 2047   $ 750     2.150 %   May 2024   C$ 750   (b) Floating rate     October 2018   $ 1,500     2.000 %   April 2021   $ 1,000     3.000 %   October 2027   $ 1,500 (a) Represents gross proceeds from issuances of long-term debt excluding debt issuance costs, discounts and premiums. (b) These notes, issued in Canadian dollars, were designated as a net investment hedge to partially offset the effects of foreign currency on our investments in certain of our foreign subsidiaries. The net proceeds from the issuances of the above notes were used for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of commercial paper. In 2017, we entered into a new five-year unsecured revolving credit agreement (Five-Year Credit Agreement) which expires on June 5, 2022. The Five-Year Credit Agreement enables us and our borrowing subsidiaries to borrow up to $3.75 billion, subject to customary terms and conditions. We may request that commitments under this agreement be increased up to $4.5 billion. Additionally, we may, once a year, request renewal of the agreement for an additional one-year period. 114 Table of Contents Also in 2017, we entered into a new 364-day unsecured revolving credit agreement (364-Day Credit Agreement) which expires on June 4, 2018. The 364-Day Credit Agreement enables us and our borrowing subsidiaries to borrow up to $3.75 billion, subject to customary terms and conditions. We may request that commitments under this agreement be increased up to $4.5 billion. We may request renewal of this facility for an additional 364-day period or convert any amounts outstanding into a term loan for a period of up to one year, which would mature no later than the anniversary of the then effective termination date. The Five-Year Credit Agreement and the 364-Day Credit Agreement together replaced our $3.7225 billion five-year credit agreement and our $3.7225 billion 364-day credit agreement both dated as of June 6, 2016. Funds borrowed under the Five-Year Credit Agreement and the 364-Day Credit Agreement may be used for general corporate purposes. Subject to certain conditions, we may borrow, prepay and reborrow amounts under these agreements. As of December 30, 2017, there were no outstanding borrowings under the Five-Year Credit Agreement or the 364-Day Credit Agreement. In 2016, we paid $2.5 billion to redeem all of our outstanding 7.900% senior notes due 2018 and 5.125% senior notes due 2019 for the principal amounts of $1.5 billion and $750 million, respectively, and terminated certain interest rate swaps. As a result, we recorded a pre-tax charge of $233 million ($156 million after-tax or $0.11 per share) to interest expense, primarily representing the premium paid in accordance with the ""make-whole"" redemption provisions. See further unaudited information in ""Items Affecting Comparability"" in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. In addition, as of December 30, 2017, our international debt of $73 million was related to borrowings from external parties including various lines of credit. These lines of credit are subject to normal banking terms and conditions and are fully committed at least to the extent of our borrowings. See ""Our Liquidity and Capital Resources"" in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for further unaudited information on our borrowings and long-term contractual commitments. Note 9  -  Financial Instruments Derivatives and Hedging We are exposed to market risks arising from adverse changes in:  commodity prices, affecting the cost of our raw materials and energy;  foreign exchange rates and currency restrictions; and  interest rates. In the normal course of business, we manage commodity price, foreign exchange and interest rate risks through a variety of strategies, including productivity initiatives, global purchasing programs and hedging. Ongoing productivity initiatives involve the identification and effective implementation of meaningful cost-saving opportunities or efficiencies, including the use of derivatives. Our global purchasing programs include fixed-price contracts and purchase orders and pricing agreements. Our hedging strategies include the use of derivatives and, in the case of our net investment hedges, debt instruments. Certain derivatives are designated as either cash flow or fair value hedges and qualify for hedge accounting treatment, while others do not qualify and are marked to market through earnings. Cash flows from derivatives used to manage commodity price, foreign exchange or interest rate risks are classified as operating activities in the cash flow statement. We classify both the earnings and cash flow impact from these derivatives consistent with the underlying hedged item. See ""Our Business Risks"" in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for further unaudited information on our business risks. 115 Table of Contents We do not use derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes. We perform assessments of our counterparty credit risk regularly, including reviewing netting agreements, if any, and a review of credit ratings, credit default swap rates and potential nonperformance of the counterparty. Based on our most recent assessment of our counterparty credit risk, we consider this risk to be low. In addition, we enter into derivative contracts with a variety of financial institutions that we believe are creditworthy in order to reduce our concentration of credit risk. Commodity Prices We are subject to commodity price risk because our ability to recover increased costs through higher pricing may be limited in the competitive environment in which we operate. This risk is managed through the use of fixed-price contracts and purchase orders, pricing agreements and derivative instruments, which include swaps and futures. In addition, risk to our supply of certain raw materials is mitigated through purchases from multiple geographies and suppliers. We use derivatives, with terms of no more than three years, to economically hedge price fluctuations related to a portion of our anticipated commodity purchases, primarily for agricultural products, energy and metals. Ineffectiveness for those derivatives that qualify for hedge accounting treatment was not material for all periods presented. Derivatives used to hedge commodity price risk that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment are marked to market each period with the resulting gains and losses recorded in corporate unallocated expenses as either cost of sales or selling, general and administrative expenses, depending on the underlying commodity. These gains and losses are subsequently reflected in division results when the divisions recognize the cost of the underlying commodity in operating profit. Our commodity derivatives had a total notional value of $0.9 billion as of December 30, 2017 and $0.8 billion as of December 31, 2016. Foreign Exchange Our operations outside of the United States generated 42% of our net revenue in 2017, with Mexico, Russia, Canada, the United Kingdom and Brazil comprising approximately 20% of our net revenue in 2017. As a result, we are exposed to foreign exchange risks in the international markets in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold. Additionally, we are exposed to foreign exchange risk from net investments in foreign subsidiaries, foreign currency purchases and foreign currency assets and liabilities created in the normal course of business. We manage this risk through sourcing purchases from local suppliers, negotiating contracts in local currencies with foreign suppliers and through the use of derivatives, primarily forward contracts with terms of no more than two years. Exchange rate gains or losses related to foreign currency transactions are recognized as transaction gains or losses in our income statement as incurred. We also use net investment hedges to partially offset the effects of foreign currency on our investments in certain of our foreign subsidiaries. Our foreign currency derivatives had a total notional value of $1.6 billion as of December 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016. The total notional amount of our debt instruments designated as net investment hedges was $1.5 billion as of December 30, 2017 and $0.8 billion as of December 31, 2016. Ineffectiveness for derivatives and non-derivatives that qualify for hedge accounting treatment was not material for all periods presented. For foreign currency derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment, all gains and losses were offset by changes in the underlying hedged items, resulting in no material net impact on earnings. Interest Rates We centrally manage our debt and investment portfolios considering investment opportunities and risks, tax consequences and overall financing strategies. We use various interest rate derivative instruments including, 116 Table of Contents but not limited to, interest rate swaps, cross-currency interest rate swaps, Treasury locks and swap locks to manage our overall interest expense and foreign exchange risk. These instruments effectively change the interest rate and currency of specific debt issuances. Certain of our fixed rate indebtedness have been swapped to floating rates. The notional amount, interest payment and maturity date of the interest rate and cross-currency interest rate swaps match the principal, interest payment and maturity date of the related debt. Our Treasury locks and swap locks are entered into to protect against unfavorable interest rate changes relating to forecasted debt transactions. Our interest rate derivatives had a total notional value of $14.2 billion as of December 30, 2017 and $11.2 billion as of December 31, 2016. Ineffectiveness for derivatives that qualify for cash flow hedge accounting treatment was not material for all periods presented. As of December 30, 2017, approximately 43% of total debt, after the impact of the related interest rate derivative instruments, was subject to variable rates, compared to approximately 38% as of December 31, 2016. Available-for-Sale Securities Investments in debt and marketable equity securities, other than investments accounted for under the equity method, are classified as available-for-sale. All highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less are classified as cash equivalents. Our investments in available-for-sale securities are reported at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses related to changes in the fair value of available-for-sale securities are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive loss within common shareholders' equity. Unrealized gains and losses on our investments in debt securities as of December 30, 2017 were not material. In 2017, we recorded a pre-tax gain of $95 million ($85 million after-tax or $0.06 per share), net of discount and fees, associated with the sale of our minority stake in Britvic. This gain was recorded in our ESSA segment in selling, general and administrative expenses. The pre-tax unrealized gain on these available-for-sale equity securities was $72 million as of December 31, 2016. See Note 2 for additional information on investments in certain equity securities. Changes in the fair value of available-for-sale securities impact net income only when such securities are sold or an other-than-temporary impairment is recognized. We regularly review our investment portfolio to determine if any security is other-than-temporarily impaired. In making this judgment, we evaluate, among other things, the duration and extent to which the fair value of a security is less than its cost; the financial condition of the issuer and any changes thereto; and our intent to sell, or whether we will more likely than not be required to sell, the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. Our assessment of whether a security is other-than-temporarily impaired could change in the future due to new developments or changes in assumptions related to any particular security. We recorded no other-than-temporary impairment charges on our available-for-sale securities for the years ended December 30, 2017, December 31, 2016 and December 26, 2015. Tingyi-Asahi Beverages Holding Co. Ltd. During 2016, we concluded that the decline in estimated fair value of our 5% indirect equity interest in TAB was other than temporary based on significant negative economic trends in China and changes in assumptions associated with TAB's future financial performance arising from the disclosure by TAB's parent company, Tingyi, regarding the operating results of its beverage business. As a result, we recorded a pre- and after-tax impairment charge of $373 million ($0.26 per share) in 2016 in the AMENA segment. This charge was recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses in our income statement and reduced the value of our 5% indirect equity interest in TAB to its estimated fair value. The estimated fair value was derived using both an income and market approach, and is considered a non-recurring Level 3 measurement within the fair value hierarchy. The carrying value of the investment in TAB was $166 million as of December 30, 2017 117 Table of Contents and December 31, 2016. We continue to monitor the impact of economic and other developments on the remaining value of our investment in TAB. In connection with our transaction with Tingyi in 2012, we received a call option to increase our holding in TAB to 20% with an expiration date in 2015. Prior to its expiration, we concluded that the probability of exercising the option was remote and, accordingly, we recorded a pre- and after-tax charge of $73 million ($0.05 per share) to write off the recorded value of this call option in 2015. See further unaudited information in ""Items Affecting Comparability"" in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 118 Table of Contents Fair Value Measurements The fair values of our financial assets and liabilities as of December 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016 are categorized as follows: 2017   2016   Fair Value Hierarchy Levels(a)   Assets(a)   Liabilities(a)   Assets(a)   Liabilities(a) Available-for-sale securities:                   Equity securities (b) 1   $  -      $  -      $ 82     $  -    Debt securities (c) 2   14,510      -      11,369      -          $ 14,510     $  -      $ 11,451     $  -    Short-term investments (d) 1   $ 228     $  -      $ 193     $  -    Prepaid forward contracts (e) 2   $ 27     $  -      $ 25     $  -    Deferred compensation (f) 2   $  -      $ 503     $  -      $ 472   Derivatives designated as fair value hedging instruments:                   Interest rate (g) 2   $ 24     $ 130     $ 66     $ 71   Derivatives designated as cash flow hedging instruments:                   Foreign exchange (h) 2   $ 15     $ 31     $ 51     $ 8   Interest rate (h) 2    -      213      -      408   Commodity (i) 1    -      2      -      1   Commodity (j) 2   2      -      2      -          $ 17     $ 246     $ 53     $ 417   Derivatives not designated as hedging instruments:                   Foreign exchange (h) 2   $ 10     $ 3     $ 2     $ 15   Commodity (i) 1    -      19     1     1   Commodity (j) 2   85     12     60     25         $ 95     $ 34     $ 63     $ 41   Total derivatives at fair value (k)     $ 136     $ 410     $ 182     $ 529   Total     $ 14,901     $ 913     $ 11,851     $ 1,001 (a) Fair value hierarchy levels are defined in Note 7.

Amounts subject to enforceable master netting arrangements or similar agreements which are not offset on the balance sheet as of December 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016 were not material. Collateral received against any of our asset positions was not material. 119 Table of Contents The carrying amounts of our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments approximate fair value due to their short-term maturity. The fair value of our debt obligations as of December 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016 was $41 billion and $38 billion, respectively, based upon prices of similar instruments in the marketplace, which are considered Level 2 inputs.

Our Code of Conduct is reinforced consistently at all levels and in all countries. We have maintained strong governance policies and practices for many years. The management of PepsiCo is responsible for the objectivity and integrity of our consolidated financial statements. The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors has engaged independent registered public accounting firm, KPMG LLP, to audit our consolidated financial statements, and they have expressed an unqualified opinion. We are committed to providing timely, accurate and understandable information to investors. Our commitment encompasses the following: Maintaining strong controls over financial reporting. Our system of internal control is based on the control criteria framework of the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission published in their report titled Internal Control  -  Integrated Framework (2013). The system is designed to provide reasonable assurance that transactions are executed as authorized and accurately recorded; that assets are safeguarded; and that accounting records are sufficiently reliable to permit the preparation of financial statements that conform in all material respects with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. We maintain disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the specified time periods. We monitor these internal controls through self-assessments and an ongoing program of internal audits. Our internal controls are reinforced through our Global Code of Conduct, which sets forth our commitment to conduct business with integrity, and within both the letter and the spirit of the law. Exerting rigorous oversight of the business. We continuously review our business results and strategies. This encompasses financial discipline in our strategic and daily business decisions. Our Executive Committee is actively involved  -  from understanding strategies and alternatives to reviewing key initiatives and financial performance. The intent is to ensure we remain objective in our assessments, constructively challenge our approach to potential business opportunities and issues, and monitor results and controls. Engaging strong and effective Corporate Governance from our Board of Directors.

We review our critical accounting policies, financial reporting and internal control matters with them and encourage their direct communication with KPMG LLP, with our Internal Auditor and with our General Counsel. We also have a Compliance & Ethics Department, led by our Chief Compliance & Ethics Officer, who coordinates our compliance policies and practices. Providing investors with financial results that are complete, transparent and understandable. The consolidated financial statements and financial information included in this report are the responsibility of management. This includes preparing the financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, which require estimates based on management's best judgment. 126 Table of Contents PepsiCo has a strong history of doing what's right.

Nooyi   Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer 127 Table of Contents Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Shareholders and Board of Directors PepsiCo, Inc.: Opinions on the Consolidated Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting We have audited the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets of PepsiCo, Inc. and Subsidiaries (the ""Company"") as of December 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, and the related Consolidated Statements of Income, Comprehensive Income, Cash Flows, and Equity for each of the fiscal years in the three-year period ended December 30, 2017 and the related notes (collectively, the ""consolidated financial statements""). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 30, 2017, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the fiscal years in the three-year period ended December 30, 2017, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 30, 2017, based on criteria established in Internal Control  -  Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Basis for Opinion The Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's consolidated financial statements and an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. 128 Table of Contents Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/ KPMG LLP We have served as the Company's auditor since 1990.

As of the end of the period covered by this report, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act). Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that as of the end of the period covered by this report our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is (1) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms, and (2) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. (b) Management's Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act. Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based upon criteria established in Internal Control  -  Integrated Framework (2013) by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on that evaluation, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 30, 2017. Attestation Report of the Registered Public Accounting Firm. KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has audited the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and, as part of their audit, has issued their report, included herein, on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. (c) Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting. There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during our fourth fiscal quarter of 2017 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. During our fourth fiscal quarter of 2017, we continued migrating certain of our financial processing systems to an enterprise-wide systems solution. These systems implementations are part of our ongoing global business transformation initiative, and we plan to continue implementing such systems throughout other parts of our businesses. In connection with these implementations and resulting business process changes, we continue to enhance the design and documentation of our internal control over financial reporting processes to maintain effective controls over our financial reporting. This transition has not materially affected, and we do not expect it to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 132 Table of Contents","https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/77476/0000077476-18-000012-index.html"

The Company operates as a cost-based, regulated electric utility with revenue requirements and customer prices determined based on the forecasted cost to serve retail customers, and a reasonable rate of return as determined by the Public Utility Commission of Oregon (OPUC). PGE meets its retail load requirement with both Company-owned generation and power purchased in the wholesale market. The Company participates in the wholesale market through the purchase and sale of electricity and natural gas in an effort to obtain reasonably-priced power to serve its retail customers. PGE, incorporated in 1930, is publicly-owned, with its common stock listed on the New York Stock Exchange. The Company operates as a single business segment, with revenues and costs related to its business activities maintained and analyzed on a total electric operations basis. PGE's state-approved service area allocation of approximately 4,000 square miles is located entirely within Oregon and includes 51 incorporated cities, of which Portland and Salem are the largest. The Company estimates that at the end of 2017 its service area population was 1.9 million, comprising approximately 46% of the population of the State of Oregon. During 2017, the Company added nearly 12,000 customers and as of December 31, 2017, served a total of 875,000 retail customers. PGE had 2,906 employees as of December 31, 2017, with 785 employees covered under one of two separate agreements with Local Union No. 125 of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers. Such agreements cover 732 and 53 employees and expire March 2020 and August 2022, respectively. Available Information PGE's Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 are available and may be accessed free of charge through the Investors section of the Company's website at PortlandGeneral.com as soon as reasonably practicable after the reports are electronically filed with, or furnished to, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). It is not intended that PGE's website and the information contained therein or connected thereto be incorporated into this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Information may also be obtained via the SEC website at sec.gov. Regulation Federal and State of Oregon regulation both can have a significant impact on the operations of PGE. In addition to the agencies and activities discussed below, the Company is subject to regulation by certain environmental agencies, as described in the Environmental Matters section in this Item 1. Federal Regulation Several federal agencies, including the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), the U.S. Department of Transportation's Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA), and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) have regulatory authority over certain of PGE's operations and activities, as described in the discussion that follows. PGE is a ""licensee,"" a ""public utility,"" and a ""user, owner, and operator of the bulk power system,"" as defined in the Federal Power Act (FPA). As such, the Company is subject to regulation by the FERC in matters related to 5 Table of Contents wholesale energy activities, transmission services, reliability and cyber security standards, natural gas pipelines, hydroelectric projects, accounting policies and practices, short-term debt issuances, and certain other matters. Wholesale Energy - PGE has authority under its FERC Market-Based Rates tariff to charge market-based rates for wholesale energy sales in all markets in which it sells electricity except in its own Balancing Authority Area (BAA). The BAA is the area in which PGE is responsible for balancing customer demand with electricity generation, in real time. Continued market-based rate authority requires specific actions by PGE including the filing of triennial market power studies with the FERC, the filing of notices of change in status, and compliance with FERC rules. In May 2017, PGE filed with the FERC proposed revisions to its market-based rate tariff to reflect its participation in the California Independent System Operator's (CAISO) Energy Imbalance Market (western EIM). In June 2017, PGE separately filed with the FERC a Notice of Change in Status requesting authorization to trade at market-based rates in that market. On September 28, 2017, the FERC issued an Order accepting both of these filings and authorizing PGE to transact at market-based rates in the western EIM. On August 30, 2017, CAISO filed with the FERC an Informational Readiness Certification for PGE's participation in the western EIM, which began on October 1, 2017. The entry into the western EIM does not change PGE's restriction on non-EIM sales at market-based rates within its BAA, which restriction does not have a material impact on the Company. For further information on the western EIM, see ""Purchased Power"" in the Power Supply section of this Item 1. Transmission - PGE offers electricity transmission service pursuant to its Open Access Transmission Tariff (OATT), which contains rates and terms and conditions of service, as filed with, and approved by the FERC. As required by the OATT, PGE provides information regarding its electric transmission business on its Open Access Same-time Information System, also known as OASIS. In PGE's Notice of Change in Status filed with the FERC on June 16, 2017, PGE stated that inbound western EIM transfers would take place on certain paths upon which the Company holds firm transmission rights, a portion of which it has committed for western EIM transfers. In the FERC's September 28, 2017 Order accepting this filing, the FERC ordered PGE to submit a change in status filing if there were to be a decrease in the amount of firm transmission capacity committed to western EIM transfers. For additional information, see the Transmission and Distribution section in this Item 1. and Item 2. - ""Properties."" Reliability and Cyber Security Standards - Pursuant to the Energy Policy Act of 2005, the FERC has adopted mandatory reliability standards for owners, users, and operators of the bulk power system. Such standards, which are applicable to PGE, were developed by the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) and the Western Electricity Coordinating Council (WECC), which have responsibility for compliance and enforcement of these standards. These standards include Critical Infrastructure Protection (CIP) standards, a set of cyber security standards that provide a framework to identify and protect critical cyber assets used to support reliable operation of the bulk power system. Natural Gas Pipelines - The Natural Gas Act of 1938 and the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978 provide the FERC authority in matters related to the construction, operation, extension, enlargement, safety, and abandonment of jurisdictional interstate natural gas pipeline facilities, as well as transportation rates and accounting for interstate natural gas commerce. PGE is subject to such authority as the Company has a 79.5% ownership interest in the Kelso-Beaver (KB) Pipeline, a 17-mile interstate pipeline that provides natural gas to the Company's natural gas-fired generating plants located near Clatskanie, Oregon: Port Westward Unit 1 (PW1); Port Westward Unit 2 (PW2); and Beaver. As the operator of record of the KB Pipeline, PGE is subject to the requirements and regulations enacted under the Pipeline Safety Laws administered by the PHMSA, which include safety standards, operator qualification standards, and public awareness requirements. Hydroelectric Licensing - Under the FPA, PGE's hydroelectric generating plants are subject to FERC licensing requirements. PGE holds FERC licenses for the Company's projects on the Deschutes, Clackamas, and Willamette Rivers. The licenses specify certain operating procedures and require capital projects focused on fish protection and reintroduction. The FERC license process includes an extensive public review process that involves the 6 Table of Contents consideration of numerous natural resource issues and environmental conditions. For additional information, see the Environmental Matters section in this Item 1. and the Generating Facilities section in Item 2. - ""Properties."" Accounting Policies and Practices - Pursuant to applicable provisions of the FPA, PGE prepares financial statements in accordance with the accounting requirements of the FERC, as set forth in its applicable Uniform System of Accounts and published accounting releases. Such financial statements are included in annual and quarterly reports filed with the FERC. Short-term Debt - Pursuant to applicable provisions of the FPA and FERC regulations, regulated public utilities are required to obtain FERC approval to issue certain securities. The Company, pursuant to an order issued by the FERC on January 3, 2018, has authorization to issue up to $900 million of short-term debt through February 6, 2020. Spent Fuel Storage - The NRC regulates the licensing and decommissioning of nuclear power plants, including PGE's Trojan nuclear power plant (Trojan), which was closed in 1993. The NRC approved the 2003 transfer of spent nuclear fuel from a spent fuel pool to a separately licensed dry cask storage facility that will house the fuel on the former plant site until a United States Department of Energy (USDOE) facility is available. Radiological decommissioning of the plant site was completed in 2004 under an NRC-approved plan, with the plant's operating license terminated in 2005. Spent fuel storage activities will continue to be subject to NRC regulation until all nuclear fuel is removed from the site and radiological decommissioning of the storage facility is completed. For additional information on spent nuclear fuel storage activities, see Note 7, Asset Retirement Obligations in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. - ""Financial Statements and Supplementary Data."" State of Oregon Regulation PGE is subject to the jurisdiction of the OPUC, and a number of other state agencies, as described in the discussion that follows. The OPUC, comprised of three members appointed by the governor of Oregon to serve non-concurrent four-year terms, reviews and approves the Company's retail prices (see ""Economic Regulation"" below) and establishes conditions of utility service. In addition, the OPUC reviews the Company's generation and transmission resource acquisition plans, pursuant to a bi-annual integrated resource planning process. The OPUC regulates the issuance of securities, prescribes accounting policies and practices, regulates the sale of utility assets, reviews transactions with affiliated companies, and has jurisdiction over the acquisition of, or exertion of substantial influence over, public utilities. The OPUC also oversees the Retail Customer Choice Program, approves funding for energy efficiency, and directs the manner in which the public purpose charges are collected and remitted to the Energy Trust of Oregon (ETO). Economic Regulation - Under Oregon law, the OPUC is required to ensure that prices and terms of service are fair and non-discriminatory, and to provide regulated companies an opportunity to earn a reasonable return on their investments. Customer prices are determined through formal proceedings that generally include testimony by participating parties, discovery, public hearings, and the issuance of a final order. Participants in such proceedings, which are conducted under established procedural schedules, include PGE, OPUC staff, and intervenors representing PGE customer groups. The following are the more significant regulatory mechanisms and proceedings under which customer prices are determined:  General Rate Cases. PGE periodically evaluates the need to change its retail electric price structure to sufficiently cover its operating costs and provide a reasonable rate of return to investors. Such changes are requested pursuant to a comprehensive general rate case process that includes revenue requirements based on a forecasted test year, debt-to-equity capital structure, return on equity, and overall rate of return. For additional information regarding the Company's most recent general rate cases, see ""General Rate Cases"" in the Overview section in Item 7. - ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations."" 7 Table of Contents  Power Costs. In addition to price changes resulting from the general rate case process, the OPUC has approved the following mechanisms by which PGE can adjust retail customer prices to cover changes in the Company's net variable power costs (NVPC). NVPC consists of the cost of power purchased and fuel used to generate electricity to meet PGE's retail load requirements, as well as the cost of settled electric and natural gas financial contracts (all classified as Purchased power and fuel expense in the Company's consolidated statements of income) and is net of wholesale revenues, which are classified as Revenues, net in the condensed consolidated statements of income. <U+25E6> Annual Power Cost Update Tariff (AUT). Under this tariff, customer prices are adjusted annually to reflect forecasted NVPC. An initial NVPC forecast, submitted to the OPUC by April 1 each year, is updated during such year and finalized in November. Based upon the final forecast, new prices, as approved by the OPUC, become effective at the beginning of the following calendar year; and <U+25E6> Power Cost Adjustment Mechanism (PCAM). Under the PCAM, PGE shares a portion of the business risk or benefit associated with NVPC. Customer prices can be adjusted annually to absorb a portion of the difference between the forecasted NVPC included in customer prices (baseline NVPC) and actual NVPC for the year. For additional information, see ""Power Operations"" in the Overview section in Item 7. - ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.""  Renewable Energy. The 2007 Oregon Renewable Energy Act (the 2007 Act) established a Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS), which required that PGE serve at least 15% of its retail load with renewable resources by 2015, with future requirements of 20% by 2020 and 25% by 2025. PGE met the 2015 requirement and expects to meet the requirements going forward. The 2007 Act allows renewable energy certificates (RECs), resulting from energy generated from qualified renewable resources placed in service after January 1, 1995, and certified low impact hydroelectric power resources, to be used to meet the Company's RPS compliance obligation. The 2007 Act also provides for the recovery in customer prices of prudently incurred costs to comply with the RPS. Under a renewable adjustment clause (RAC) mechanism, PGE can recover the revenue requirement of new renewable resources and associated transmission that is not yet included in prices. Under the RAC, PGE may submit a filing by April 1 of each year for new renewable resources expected to be placed in service in the current year, with prices expected to become effective January 1 of the following year. In addition, the RAC provides for the deferral and subsequent recovery of eligible costs incurred prior to January 1 of the following year. Under the RAC, the Company has submitted no material additions or deferrals for the three years 2015 through 2017. The State of Oregon passed Senate Bill 1547, effective March 8, 2016, a law referred to as the Oregon Clean Electricity and Coal Transition Plan (OCEP). The legislation prevents large utilities from including the costs and benefits associated with coal-fired generation in their Oregon retail rates after 2030 (subject to an exception that extends this date until 2035 for the Company's output from the Colstrip Units 3 and 4 coal-fired generating plant (Colstrip)), increases the RPS percentages in certain future years, changes the life of certain RECs, requires the development of community solar programs, seeks the development of transportation electrification programs, and requires that a portion of electricity come from small scale renewable or certain biomass projects. For more information regarding the OCEP, and its impact on PGE, see the ""Legal, Regulatory, and Environmental Matters"" section of Item 7. - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.  Decoupling. The decoupling mechanism provides a means for recovery of margin lost as a result of a reduction in electricity sales attributable to energy efficiency and conservation efforts undertaken by residential and certain commercial customers. The mechanism, authorized by the OPUC through 2019, 8 Table of Contents provides for: i) collections from customers if weather-adjusted energy use per customer is lower than levels anticipated in the Company's most recent general rate case; or ii) refunds to customers if weather-adjusted use per customer exceeds levels anticipated in the most recent general rate case. For additional information, see ""Legal, Regulatory, and Environmental"" in the Overview section in Item 7. - ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations."" As needed, other ratemaking proceedings may occur and can involve charges or credits related to specific costs, programs, or activities, as well as the recovery or refund of deferred amounts recorded pursuant to specific OPUC authorization. Such amounts are generally collected from, or refunded to, retail customers through the use of supplemental tariffs. For additional information on the RAC, the OCEP, and other ratemaking proceedings, see the ""Legal, Regulatory, and Environmental Matters"" discussion in the Overview section in Item 7. - ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations."" Senate Bill 978 - The State of Oregon legislature passed a bill in its 2017 session referred to as SB 978, which directs the OPUC to investigate and provide a report to the legislature by September 15, 2018 on how developing industry trends, technology, and policy drivers in the electricity sector might impact the existing regulatory system and incentives. PGE is actively working on this initiative, both internally and in conjunction with the OPUC, to provide input and support development of the report. The OPUC recently opened a proceeding to collect input on possible changes to the regulatory model from stakeholders including regulated utilities such as PGE. Integrated Resource Plan - Unless the OPUC grants an extension, PGE is required to file an Integrated Resource Plan (IRP) with the OPUC within two years of its previous IRP acknowledgment order. The IRP guides the utility on a plan to meet future customer demand and describes the Company's future energy supply strategy, which reflects new technologies, market conditions, and regulatory requirements. The primary goal of the IRP is to identify a portfolio of generation, transmission, demand-side, and energy efficiency resources that, along with the Company's existing portfolio, provides the best combination of expected cost and associated risks and uncertainties for PGE and its customers. For additional information on PGE's 2016 IRP, see ""Integrated Resource Plans"" in the Overview section in this Item 7. - ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations."" Retail Customer Choice Program - PGE's commercial and industrial customers have access to pricing options other than cost of service, including daily market index-based pricing, and Direct Access, whereby customers purchase their electricity from an Electricity Service Supplier (ESS). All commercial and industrial customers are eligible for Direct Access, under which the Company receives revenue only for the transmission and delivery of the energy to the ESS customers, while only certain large commercial and industrial customers may elect to be served by PGE on a daily market index-based price. All non-residential retail customers have an option to be served by an ESS for a one-year period. Certain large commercial and industrial customers may elect to be removed from cost of service pricing for a fixed three-year or a minimum five-year term, to be served either by an ESS, or by the Company under a daily market index-based price. Participation in the fixed three-year and minimum five-year opt-out programs is capped at 300 average megawatts (MWa) in aggregate. The majority of the energy supplied under PGE's Retail Customer Choice program is provided to customers that have elected service from an ESS under the minimum five-year opt-out program. The retail customer choice program does not have a material impact on PGE's financial condition or operating results as revenue changes resulting from increases or decreases in electricity sales to Direct Access customers are substantially offset by changes in the Company's cost of purchased power and fuel. Further, the program provides for transition adjustment charges or credits to Direct Access and market-based pricing customers that reflect the above- or below-market cost of energy resources owned or purchased by PGE. Such adjustments are designed to ensure that the costs or benefits of the program do not unfairly shift to those customers that continue to purchase their energy requirements from the Company. For further information regarding Direct Access deliveries, see ""Customers and Demand"" in the Overview section of Item 7. - ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations."" 9 Table of Contents In addition to cost of service pricing, residential and small commercial customers can select portfolio options from PGE that include time-of-use and renewable resource pricing. Energy Efficiency Funding - Oregon law provides for a public purpose charge to fund cost-effective energy efficiency measures, new renewable energy resources, and weatherization measures for low-income housing. This charge, equal to 3% of retail revenues, is collected from customers and remitted to the ETO and other agencies for administration of these programs. The Company collected $53 million from customers for this charge in 2017, $50 million in 2016, and $51 million in 2015. In addition to the public purpose charge, PGE also remits to the ETO amounts collected from its customers under an Energy Efficiency Adjustment tariff to fund additional energy efficiency measures. This charge was 3.6%, 2.7%, and 2.4% of retail revenues for applicable customers in 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. Under the tariff, $66 million, $48 million, and $42 million were collected from eligible customers in 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. Siting - Oregon's Energy Facility Siting Council (EFSC) has regulatory and siting responsibility for large electric generating facilities, certain high voltage transmission lines, intrastate gas pipelines, and radioactive waste disposal sites. The responsibilities of the EFSC also include oversight of the decommissioning of Trojan. The seven volunteer members of the EFSC are appointed to four-year terms by the governor of Oregon, with staff support provided by the Oregon Department of Energy. Regulatory Accounting PGE is subject to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) and, as a regulated public utility, the effects of rate regulation are reflected in its financial statements. These principles provide for the deferral as regulatory assets of certain actual or estimated costs that would otherwise be charged to expense, based on expected recovery from customers in future prices. Likewise, certain actual or anticipated credits that would otherwise reduce expense can be deferred as regulatory liabilities, based on expected future credits or refunds to customers. PGE records regulatory assets or liabilities if it is probable that they will be reflected in future prices, based on regulatory orders or other available evidence. The Company periodically assesses the applicability of regulatory accounting to its business, considering both the current and anticipated future regulatory environment and related accounting guidance. For additional information, see ""Regulatory Assets and Liabilities"" in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, and Note 6, Regulatory Assets and Liabilities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. - ""Financial Statements and Supplementary Data."" Customers and Revenues PGE generates revenue primarily through the sale and delivery of electricity to retail customers located exclusively in Oregon within a service area approved by the OPUC. In addition, the Company distributes power to commercial and industrial customers that choose to purchase their energy from an ESS. Although the Company includes such Direct Access customers in its customer counts and energy delivered to such customers in its total retail energy deliveries, retail revenues include only delivery charges and applicable transition adjustments for these Direct Access customers. The Company conducts retail electric operations within its service territory and competes with: i) the local natural gas distribution company for the energy needs of residential and commercial space heating, water heating, and appliances; and ii) fuel oil suppliers, primarily for residential customers' space heating needs. Energy efficiency and conservation measures, as well as an increasing trend toward rooftop solar generation in recent years, also influence customer demand. Retail Revenues Retail customers are classified as residential, commercial, or industrial, with no single customer representing more than 6% of PGE's total retail revenues or 9% of total retail deliveries. While the twenty largest commercial and industrial customers constituted 11% of total retail revenues in 2017, they represented nine different groups including high tech, paper manufacturing, governmental agencies, health services, and retailers. PGE's Retail revenues, retail energy deliveries, and average number of retail customers consist of the following:  Years Ended December 31,   2017   2016   2015 Retail revenues(1) (dollars in millions):                       Residential $ 969     52 %   $ 907     51 %   $ 895     50 % Commercial 669     36     665     37     662     37   Industrial 212     11     208     12     228     13   Subtotal 1,850     99     1,780     100     1,785     100   Other accrued (deferred) revenues, net 10     1     3      -      (10 )    -    Total retail revenues $ 1,860     100 %   $ 1,783     100 %   $ 1,775     100 % Retail energy deliveries(2) (MWh in thousands):                       Residential 7,880     40 %   7,348     39 %   7,325     38 % Commercial 7,555     38     7,457     39     7,511     39   Industrial 4,283     22     4,166     22     4,546     23   Total retail energy deliveries 19,718     100 %   18,971     100 %   19,382     100 % Average number of retail customers:                       Residential 762,211     88 %   752,365     88 %   742,467     88 % Commercial 107,855     12     106,773     12     105,802     12   Industrial 267      -      258      -      255      -    Total 870,333     100 %   859,396     100 %   848,524     100 % (1) Includes both revenues from customers who purchase their energy supplies from the Company and revenues from the delivery of energy to those commercial and industrial customers that purchase their energy from ESSs. (2) Includes both energy sold to retail customers and energy deliveries to those commercial and industrial customers that purchase their energy from ESSs. 10 Table of Contents Additional averages for retail customers are as follows:    Years Ended December 31,   2017   2016   2015 Residential           Revenue per customer (in dollars): $ 1,181     $ 1,114     $ 1,139   Usage per customer (in kilowatt hours): 10,338     9,766     9,866   Revenue per kilowatt hour (in cents):   11.42 ¢     11.40 ¢     11.55 ¢ Commercial           Revenue per customer (in dollars): $ 6,142     $ 6,166     $ 6,254   Usage per customer (in kilowatt hours): 70,046     69,839     70,987   Revenue per kilowatt hour (in cents):   8.77 ¢     8.83 ¢     8.81 ¢ Industrial           Revenue per customer (in dollars): $ 792,466     $ 804,953     $ 876,866   Usage per customer (in kilowatt hours): 16,041,461     16,146,371     17,485,281   Revenue per kilowatt hour (in cents):   4.94 ¢     4.99 ¢     5.01 ¢ For additional information, see the Results of Operations section in Item 7. - ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations."" In accordance with state regulations, PGE's retail customer prices are based on the Company's cost of service and are determined through general rate case proceedings and various tariff filings with the OPUC. Additionally, the Company offers different pricing options including a daily market price option, various time-of-use options, and several renewable energy options, which are offered to residential and small commercial customers. For additional information on customer options, see ""Retail Customer Choice Program"" within the Regulation section of this Item 1. Additional information on the customer classes follows. Residential customers include single family housing, multiple family housing (such as apartments, duplexes, and town homes), mobile homes, and small farms. Residential demand is sensitive to the effects of weather, with demand historically highest during the winter heating season; although, increased use of air conditioning in PGE's service territory has caused the summer peaks to increase. In recent years, summer peaks have exceeded winter peaks and long-term load forecasts expect that trend to continue. Economic conditions can also affect residential demand; strong job growth and population growth in PGE's service territory have led to increasing customer growth rates. Residential demand is also impacted by energy efficiency measures; however, the Company's decoupling mechanism is intended to mitigate the financial effects of such measures. During 2017, total residential deliveries increased 7.2% compared with 2016. PGE witnessed a 1.3% increase in the average number of residential customers served during the year and average usage per customer increased 5.9% driven by favorable weather compared to the prior year. Temperatures in 2017 were characterized by both a cold heating season in the first quarter and a warm cooling season over the summer months, increasing residential energy deliveries. The year-over-year impact was intensified by unseasonably warm heating season temperatures seen in 2016, which decreased residential energy deliveries in that year. On a weather-adjusted basis, energy deliveries to residential customers decreased by 2.2% in 2017 when compared with 2016. During 2016, residential customer count increased by 1.3%, however the summer cooling season was not as extreme as experienced in 2015 leading to a decrease in average use per customer of 1.0%. The overall result was that total residential energy deliveries increased 0.3% in 2016 compared with 2015. On a weather-adjusted basis, energy deliveries to residential customers increased by 1.4% in 2016 when compared with 2015. Commercial customers consist of non-residential customers who accept energy deliveries at voltages equivalent to those delivered to residential customers. This customer class includes most businesses, small industrial companies, and public street and highway lighting accounts. 11 Table of Contents The Company's commercial customers are somewhat less susceptible to weather conditions than the residential customer, although weather does affect commercial demand to some extent. Economic conditions and fluctuations in total employment in the region can also lead to changes in energy demand from commercial customers. Energy efficiency measures also impact commercial demand, although the Company's decoupling mechanism partially mitigates the financial effects of such measures. In 2017, a 1.0% growth in the average number of commercial customers and a cold first quarter heating season drove a 1.3% increase in commercial deliveries compared with 2016. Weather-adjusted, deliveries to commercial customers decreased by 0.7% in 2017. Deliveries to several retail sectors decreased, including food and merchandise stores and office, finance, insurance, and real estate. These decreases were only partially offset by increases in the miscellaneous and other services sectors, which are driven by a strong construction cycle and data center growth. Energy efficiency continues to impact growth, and conservation and building codes and standards are likely reducing energy deliveries beyond the impact of energy efficiency programs. Deliveries to commercial customers decreased 0.7% in 2016 compared with 2015, which was primarily due to unfavorable weather conditions and slightly lower demand from a few groups, including food stores, which were impacted by a series of mergers and bankruptcies, government and education, and irrigation and pumping load in 2016 due to the extremely dry conditions that existed in 2015. On a weather-adjusted basis, commercial deliveries for 2016 were comparable to 2015, while a 0.9% increase in the average number of commercial customers occurred. Industrial customers consist of non-residential customers who accept delivery at higher voltages than commercial customers, with pricing based on the amount of electricity delivered on the applicable tariff. Demand from industrial customers is primarily driven by economic conditions, with weather having little impact on this customer class. The Company's industrial energy deliveries increased 2.8% in 2017 from 2016, reflecting increases across several manufacturing sectors, with the strongest increases to customers in high tech manufacturing and their suppliers. These increases were largely offset by the closure of a large paper manufacturing customer that ceased operations in October 2017. The 8.4% decrease in 2016 from 2015 was largely due to another large paper manufacturing customer, to which PGE had delivered approximately 450 thousand Megawatt hours (MWh) annually, with corresponding revenues of approximately $20 million, having ceased operations in late 2015. Although the majority of power this customer purchased was under the Company's daily market index-based price option, a portion was at cost of service prices. Adjusted for that one customer, industrial energy deliveries were 1.4% higher in 2016 than 2015 levels driven by continued, albeit slowed, increases in energy deliveries to high tech manufacturing customers. Other accrued (deferred) revenues, net include items that are not currently in customer prices, but are expected to be in prices in a future period. Such amounts include, among other things, deferrals recorded under the RAC and the decoupling mechanism. For further information on these items, see ""OPUC and Other State of Oregon Regulation"" in the Regulation section of this Item 1. Wholesale Revenues PGE participates in the wholesale electricity marketplace in order to balance its supply of power to meet the needs of its retail customers. Interconnected transmission systems in the western United States serve utilities with diverse load requirements and allow the Company to purchase and sell electricity within the region depending upon the relative price and availability of power, hydro and wind conditions, and daily and seasonal retail demand. Wholesale revenues represented 5% of total revenues in each of the past three years. The majority of PGE's wholesale electricity sales is to utilities and power marketers and is predominantly short-term. The Company may choose to net its purchases and sales with the same counterparty rather than 12 Table of Contents simultaneously receiving and delivering physical power; in such cases, only the net amount of those purchases or sales required to meet retail and wholesale obligations will be physically settled. Other Operating Revenues Other operating revenues consist primarily of gains and losses on the sale of natural gas volumes purchased that exceeded what was needed to fuel the Company's generating facilities, as well as revenues from transmission services, excess transmission capacity resales, excess fuel sales, pole contact rentals, and other electric services provided to customers. Other operating revenues have represented 2% of total revenues in each of the past three years. Seasonality Demand for electricity by PGE's residential and, to a lesser extent, commercial customers, is affected by seasonal weather conditions. The Company uses heating and cooling degree-days to determine the effect of weather on the demand for electricity. Heating and cooling degree-days provide cumulative variances in the average daily temperature from a baseline of 65 degrees, over a period of time, to indicate the extent to which customers are likely to use, or have used, electricity for heating or air conditioning. The higher the number of degree-days, the greater the expected demand for electricity. The following table presents the heating and cooling degree-days for the most recent three-year period, along with 15-year averages for the most recent year provided by the National Weather Service, as measured at Portland International Airport: Heating Degree-Days   Cooling Degree-Days 2017 4,558   700 2016 3,552   548 2015 3,461   785 15-year average 4,233   471 PGE's all-time high net system load peak of 4,073 megawatts (MW) occurred in December 1998. The Company's all-time summer peak of 3,976 MW occurred in August 2017. The following table presents PGE's average winter (defined as January, February, and December) and summer (defined as July, August, and September) loads for the periods presented, along with the corresponding peak load (in MWs) and month in which such peak occurred. As the table below illustrates, although the average winter loads continue to run higher than average summer loads, the Company has experienced its highest peak loads during summer in each of the past three years: Winter Loads   Summer Loads   Average   Peak   Month   Average   Peak   Month 2017 2,698   3,727   January   2,380   3,976   August 2016 2,537   3,716   December   2,246   3,726   August 2015 2,509   3,255   December   2,390   3,914   July The Company tracks and evaluates both load growth and peak load requirements for purposes of long-term load forecasting, integrated resource planning, and preparing general rate case assumptions. Behavior patterns, conservation, energy efficiency initiatives and measures, weather effects, economic conditions, and demographic changes all play a role in determining expected future customer demand and the resulting resources the Company will need to adequately meet those loads and maintain adequate capacity reserves. Power Supply PGE relies upon its generating resources, as well as wholesale power purchases from third parties to meet its customers' energy requirements. The volume of electricity the Company generates is dependent upon, among other factors, the capacity and availability of its generating resources and the price and availability of wholesale power and natural gas. As part of its power supply operations, the Company enters into short- and long-term power and fuel purchase agreements. PGE executes economic dispatch decisions concerning its own generation, and participates in the wholesale market in an effort to obtain reasonably-priced power for its retail customers, manage risk, and administer its current long-term wholesale contracts. The Company also promotes energy efficiency measures to meet its energy requirements. PGE's generating resources consist of seven thermal plants (natural gas- and coal-fired), two wind farms, and seven hydroelectric facilities. Capacity of the thermal plants represents the MW the plant is capable of generating under normal operating conditions, which is affected by ambient temperatures, net of electricity used in the operation of the plant. Capacity of both hydro and wind generating resources represent the nameplate MW, which varies from actual energy expected to be received as these types of generating resources are highly dependent upon river flows and wind conditions, respectively. Availability represents the percentage of the year the plant was available for operations, which reflects the impact of planned and forced outages. For a complete listing of these facilities, see ""Generating Facilities"" in Item 2. - ""Properties."" 13 Table of Contents PGE's resource capacity (in MW) was as follows: As of December 31,   2017   2016   2015   Capacity   %   Capacity   %   Capacity   % Generation:                       Thermal:                       Natural gas 1,831     39 %   1,805     38 %   1,371     30 % Coal 814     17     814     17     814     17   Total thermal 2,645     56     2,619     55     2,185     47   Wind (1) 717     15     717     15     717     16   Hydro (2) 495     10     495     11     495     11   Total generation 3,857     81     3,831     81     3,397     74   Purchased power:                       Long-term contracts:                       Capacity/exchange 100     2     250     5     250     5   Hydro 531     12     534     12     592     13   Wind 39     1     39     1     39     1   Solar 13      -      13      -      13      -    Other 18      -      18      -      118     3   Total long-term contracts 701     15     854     18     1,012     22   Short-term contracts 185     4     45     1     200     4   Total purchased power 886     19     899     19     1,212     26   Total resource capacity 4,743     100 %   4,730     100 %   4,609     100 % (1) Capacity represents nameplate and differs from expected energy to be generated, which is expected to range from 215 MWa to 290 MWa, dependent upon wind conditions. (2) Capacity represents net capacity and differs from expected energy to be generated, which is expected to range from 200 MWa to 250 MWa, dependent upon river flows. For information regarding actual generating output and purchases for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, see the Results of Operations section of Item 7. - ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations."" Generation The portion of PGE's retail load requirements generated by its plants varies from year to year and is determined by various factors, including planned and unplanned outages, availability and price of coal and natural gas, precipitation and snow-pack levels, the market price of electricity, and wind variability. Thermal The Company has five natural gas-fired generating facilities: PW1, PW2, Beaver, Coyote Springs Unit 1 (Coyote Springs), and Carty. These natural gas-fired generating plants provided approximately 33% of PGE's total retail load requirement in 2017, 32% in 2016, and 25% in 2015. The Company operates, and has a 90% ownership interest in Boardman and has a 20% ownership interest in Colstrip Units 3 and 4 coal-fired generating plant (Colstrip), which is operated by a third party. These two coal-fired generating facilities provided approximately 18% of the Company's total retail load requirement in 2017, compared with 19% in 2016, and 22% in 2015. Boardman is scheduled to cease coal-fired operations at the end of 2020, and pursuant to Oregon Senate Bill 1547, PGE's portion of Colstrip is scheduled to be fully depreciated by 2030, with the potential to utilize the output of the facility, in Oregon, until 2035. For additional information on Senate Bill 1547, see ""Legal, Regulatory, 14 Table of Contents and Environmental Matters"" in the Overview section in Item 7. - ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations."" The thermal plants provide reliable power and capacity reserves for PGE's customers. These resources have a combined capacity of 2,645 MW, representing approximately 69% of the net capacity of PGE's generating portfolio. Thermal plant availability, excluding Colstrip, was 88% in 2017, 92% in 2016, and 89% in 2015, while Colstrip availability was 86% in 2017, compared with 85% in 2016 and 93% in 2015. Wind       PGE owns and operates two wind farms, Biglow Canyon Wind Farm (Biglow Canyon) and Tucannon River Wind Farm (Tucannon River). Biglow Canyon, located in Sherman County, Oregon, is PGE's largest renewable energy resource consisting of 217 wind turbines with a total nameplate capacity of approximately 450 MW. Tucannon River, placed in service in December 2014, is located in southeastern Washington and consists of 116 wind turbines with a total nameplate capacity of 267 MW. The energy from wind resources provided 9% of the Company's total retail load requirement in 2017, 10% in 2016, and 9% in 2015. Availability for these resources was 96% in 2017, compared with 95% in 2016 and 97% in 2015. The expected energy from wind resources differs from the nameplate capacity and is expected to range from 135 MWa to 180 MWa for Biglow Canyon and from 80 MWa to 110 MWa for Tucannon River, dependent upon wind conditions. Hydro The Company's FERC-licensed hydroelectric projects consist of Pelton/Round Butte on the Deschutes River near Madras, Oregon (discussed below), four plants on the Clackamas River, and one on the Willamette River. The licenses for these projects expire at various dates ranging from 2035 to 2055. Although these plants have a combined capacity of 495 MW, actual energy received is dependent upon river flows. Energy from these resources provided 9% of the Company's total retail load requirement in 2017, 9% in 2016, and 8% in 2015, with availability of 95% in 2017, and 99% in both 2016 and in 2015. Northwest hydro conditions have a significant impact on the region's power supply, with water conditions significantly impacting PGE's cost of power and its ability to economically displace more expensive thermal generation and spot market power purchases. PGE has a 66.67% ownership interest in the 455 MW Pelton/Round Butte hydroelectric project on the Deschutes River, with the remaining interest held by the Confederated Tribes of the Warm Springs Reservation of Oregon (Tribes). A 50-year joint license for the project, which is operated by PGE, was issued by the FERC in 2005. The Tribes have an option to purchase an additional undivided 16.66% interest in Pelton/Round Butte at its discretion on December 31, 2021. The Tribes have a second option in 2036 to purchase an undivided 0.02% interest in Pelton/Round Butte. If both options are exercised by the Tribes, the Tribes' ownership percentage would exceed 50%. Dispatchable Standby Generation (DSG) - PGE has a DSG program under which the Company can start, operate, and monitor customer-owned diesel-fueled standby generators when needed to provide NERC-required operating reserves. As of December 31, 2017, there were 59 sites with a total DSG capacity of 123 MW. Additional DSG projects are being pursued with a total goal of 135 MW online by the end of 2021. Fuel Supply - PGE contracts for natural gas and coal supplies required to fuel the Company's thermal generating plants, with certain plants also able to operate on fuel oil if needed. In addition, the Company uses forward, future, swap, and option contracts to manage its exposure to volatility in natural gas prices. Natural Gas Physical supplies of natural gas are generally purchased up to twelve months in advance of delivery and based on anticipated operation of the plants. PGE attempts to manage the price risk of natural gas supply through the use of financial contracts up to 60 months in advance of expected need of energy. PGE owns 79.5%, and is the operator of record, of the Kelso-Beaver Pipeline, which directly connects PW1, PW2, and Beaver to Northwest Pipeline, an interstate natural gas pipeline operating 15 Table of Contents between British Columbia and New Mexico. Currently, PGE transports natural gas on the Kelso-Beaver Pipeline for its own use under a firm transportation service agreement, with capacity offered to others on an interruptible basis to the extent not utilized by the Company. PGE has access to 103,305 Dth per day of firm natural gas transportation capacity to serve the three plants. PGE also has contractual access to natural gas storage in Mist, Oregon from which it can draw as needed. The Company expects to utilize this resource when economic factors favor its use or in the event that natural gas supplies are interrupted. The storage facility is owned and operated by a local natural gas company, NW Natural, and may be utilized to provide fuel to PW1, PW2, and Beaver. PGE has entered into a long-term agreement with this gas company to expand the current storage facilities, including the development of an underground storage reservoir and construction of a new compressor station and 13-mile pipeline, that will be designed to provide no-notice storage services to these PGE generating plants. Pursuant to the agreement, on September 30, 2016, PGE issued NW Natural a Notice To Proceed with construction of the expansion project, which NW Natural estimates will be completed during the winter of 2018-2019, at a cost of approximately $132 million. Beaver has the capability to operate on fuel oil when it is economical or if the plant's natural gas supply is interrupted. PGE had an approximate five day supply of ultra-low sulfur diesel fuel oil at the plant site as of December 31, 2017. The current operating permit for Beaver limits the number of gallons of fuel oil that can be burned daily, which effectively limits the daily hours of operation of Beaver on fuel oil. To serve Coyote Springs and Carty, PGE has access to 119,500 Dth per day of firm natural gas transportation capacity on three pipeline systems accessing gas fields in Alberta, Canada. PGE believes that sufficient market supplies of natural gas are available for Coyote Springs and Carty for the foreseeable future, based on anticipated operation of the plants. Although Coyote Springs was designed to also operate on fuel oil, such capability has been deactivated in order to optimize natural gas operations. Coal           PGE has fixed-price purchase agreements that, together with existing inventory, will provide coal sufficient for the anticipated operating needs for Boardman during 2018. The coal is obtained from surface mining operations in Wyoming and is delivered by rail under two separate transportation contracts which extend through 2020. The terms of contracts and the quality of coal are expected to be staged in alignment with required emissions limits. PGE believes that sufficient market supplies of coal are available to meet anticipated coal-fired operations of Boardman through 2020. The Colstrip co-owners currently obtain coal to fuel the plant via conveyor belt from a mine that lies adjacent to the facility. The current contract for coal supply extends through 2019 and the Colstrip co-owners continue negotiations to extend the contract. Purchased Power PGE supplements its own generation with power purchased in the wholesale market to meet its retail load requirements. The Company utilizes short- and long-term wholesale power purchase contracts in an effort to provide the most favorable economic mix on a variable cost basis. Such contracts have original terms ranging from one month to 39 years and expire at varying dates through 2055. PGE's medium-term power cost strategy helps mitigate the effect of price volatility on its customers due to changing energy market conditions. The strategy allows the Company to take positions in power and fuel markets up to five years in advance of physical delivery. By purchasing a portion of anticipated energy needs for future 16 Table of Contents years over an extended period, PGE mitigates a portion of the potential future volatility in the average cost of purchased power and fuel. The Company's major power purchase contracts consist of the following (also see the preceding table which summarizes the average resource capabilities related to these contracts): Capacity/exchange - PGE has one contract that provides the Company with firm capacity to help meet peak loads. The agreement allows for up to 100 MW of seasonal peaking capacity during winter periods through February 2019. Hydro - During 2017, the Company had three contracts that provided for the purchase of power generated from hydroelectric projects with an aggregate capacity of 56 MW and contract expirations between 2018 and 2032. In addition, PGE has the following:  Mid-Columbia hydro - PGE has long-term power purchase contracts with certain public utility districts in the state of Washington for a portion of the output of three hydroelectric projects on the mid-Columbia River. One contract representing 150 MW of capacity expires in 2018 and a contract representing 163 MW of capacity expires in 2052. Although the projects currently provide a total of 313 MW of capacity, actual energy received is dependent upon river flows and capacity amounts may decline over time.  Confederated Tribes - PGE has a long-term agreement under which the Company purchases, at index prices, the Tribes' interest in the output of the Pelton/Round Butte hydroelectric project. Although the agreement provides approximately 162 MW of net capacity, actual energy received is dependent upon river flows. The term of the agreement coincides with the term of the FERC license for this project, which expires in 2055. In 2014, PGE entered into an agreement with the Tribes under which the Tribes have agreed to sell, on modified payment terms, their share of the energy generated from the Pelton/Round Butte hydroelectric project exclusively to the Company through 2024. Wind - PGE has three contracts that provide for the purchase of renewable wind-generated electricity and extend to various dates between 2028 and 2035. The expected energy from these wind contracts differs from the nameplate capacity and is expected to approximate 39 MWa, dependent upon wind conditions. Solar - PGE has three agreements that expire during 2036 and 2037 to purchase power generated from photovoltaic solar projects, which have a combined generating capacity of 7 MW. In addition, the Company operates, and purchases power from three solar projects with an aggregate of approximately 6 MW of capacity. The expected energy from these solar resources will vary from the nameplate capacity due to varying solar conditions. Other - These primarily consist of long-term contracts to purchase power from various counterparties, including other Pacific Northwest utilities, over terms extending into 2031. Short-term contracts - These contracts are for delivery periods of one month up to one year in length. They are entered into with various counterparties to provide additional firm energy to help meet the Company's load requirements. PGE also utilizes spot purchases of power in the open market to secure the energy required to serve its retail customers. Such purchases are made under contracts that range in duration from 15 minutes to less than one month. For additional information regarding PGE's power purchase contracts, see Note 15, Commitments and Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. - ""Financial Statements and Supplementary Data."" PGE began participating in the western EIM on October 1, 2017. As a market participant in the western EIM PGE allows certain of its generating plants to receive automated dispatch signals from the CAISO that allows for load balancing with other western EIM participants in five-minute intervals. The Company expects such load balancing will help integrate more renewable energy into the grid by better matching the variable output of renewable resources. Additionally, participation in the western EIM gives PGE access to the lowest-cost energy available in 17 Table of Contents the region to meet changes in real-time energy loads and short-term variations in customer demand. The Company expects that participation in the western EIM will reduce costs for PGE customers. Future Energy Resource Strategy PGE's IRP outlines the Company's plan to meet future customer demand and describes PGE's future energy supply strategy. For a detailed discussion of the IRPs, see ""Integrated Resource Plan"" within the Overview section of Item 7. - ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations."" Transmission and Distribution Transmission systems deliver energy from generating facilities to distribution systems for final delivery to customers. PGE schedules energy deliveries over its transmission system in accordance with FERC requirements and operates one balancing authority area (an electric system bounded by interchange metering) in its service territory. In 2017, PGE delivered approximately 23 million MWh in its balancing authority area through 1,250 circuit miles of transmission lines operating at or above 115 kilovolts (kV). PGE's transmission system is part of the Western Interconnection, the regional grid in the western United States. The Western Interconnection includes the interconnected transmission systems of 11 western states, two Canadian provinces and parts of Mexico, and is subject to the reliability rules of the WECC and the NERC. PGE relies on transmission contracts with Bonneville Power Administration (BPA) to transmit a significant amount of the Company's generation to serve its distribution system. PGE's transmission system, together with contractual rights on other transmission systems, enables the Company to integrate and access generation resources to meet its customers' energy requirements. PGE's generation is managed on a coordinated basis to obtain maximum load-carrying capability and efficiency. The Company's transmission and distribution systems are generally located as follows:  On property owned or leased by PGE;  Under or over streets, alleys, highways and other public places, the public domain and national forests, and federal and state lands primarily under franchises, easements or other rights that are generally subject to termination;  Under or over private property primarily pursuant to easements obtained from the record holder of title at the time of grant; and  Under or over Native American reservations under grant of easement by the Secretary of the Interior or lease or easement by Native American tribes. The Company's wholesale transmission activities are regulated by the FERC and are offered on a non-discriminatory basis, with all potential customers provided equal access to PGE's transmission system through PGE's OATT. In accordance with its OATT, PGE offers several transmission services to wholesale customers:  Network integration transmission service, a service that integrates generating resources to serve retail loads;  Short- and long-term firm point-to-point transmission service, a service with fixed delivery and receipt points; and  Non-firm point-to-point service, an ""as available"" service with fixed delivery and receipt points. For additional information regarding the Company's transmission and distribution facilities, see ""Transmission and Distribution"" in Item 2. - ""Properties."" 18 Table of Contents Environmental Matters PGE's operations are subject to a wide range of environmental protection laws and regulations, which pertain to air and water quality, endangered species and wildlife protection, and hazardous material. Various state and federal agencies regulate environmental matters that relate to the siting, construction, and operation of generation, transmission, and substation facilities and the handling, accumulation, clean-up, and disposal of toxic and hazardous substances. In addition, certain of the Company's hydroelectric projects and transmission facilities are located on property under the jurisdiction of federal and state agencies, and/or tribal entities that have authority in environmental protection matters. The following discussion provides further information on certain regulations that affect the Company's operations and facilities. Air Quality Clean Air Act - PGE's operations, primarily its thermal generating plants, are subject to regulation under the federal Clean Air Act (CAA), which addresses, among other things, particulate matter, hazardous air pollutants, and greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs). Oregon and Montana, the states in which PGE's thermal facilities are located, also implement and administer certain portions of the CAA and have set standards that are at least equal to federal standards. To maintain compliance with the various air quality standards, PGE manages its air emissions at its thermal generating plants by the use of low sulfur fuel, emissions and combustion controls and monitoring, and sulfur dioxide (SO2) allowances awarded under the CAA. The current and expected future SO2 allowances, along with the emissions controls and the continued use of low sulfur fuel, are anticipated to be sufficient to permit the Company to meet its air emissions compliance requirements. DEQ has initiated a rulemaking to overhaul its air toxic permit program for industrial sources. DEQ placed proposed rules on public notice and has accepted comments. PGE is evaluating potential impacts the proposed regulations could have on its thermal generating plants. Climate Change - In August 2015, the EPA released a rule, which it called the ""Clean Power Plan"" (CPP). Under the rule, each state would have to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from its power sector on a state-wide basis by an amount specified by the EPA. The rule was intended to result in a reduction of carbon dioxide emissions from existing power plants across all states to approximately 32% below 2005 levels by 2030. In February 2016, the United States Supreme Court granted a stay, halting implementation and enforcement of the CPP, pending the resolution of legal challenges to the rule. On March 28, 2017, the President of the United States issued an Executive Order that directed various agencies to review existing regulations that potentially burden the development of the nation's energy resources. The Department of Justice (DOJ) filed requests with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit (DC Circuit Court) to suspend and hold in abeyance the current litigation over the CPP in light of the Executive Order while EPA reviews the rule and determines its next steps. The DC Circuit Court granted the requests. In October 2017, the EPA published in the Federal Register for public comment a proposed CPP repeal rule, in which it outlined the rationale for repealing the CPP. The public comment period for the repeal rule is open until April 26, 2018.  Additionally, on December 28, 2017, the EPA published in the Federal Register an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (ANPR) seeking public comment on specific topics for the EPA to consider in developing any subsequent replacement rule. Public comment on the ANPR is open until February 26, 2018. The Company cannot predict the impact of the stay, the ultimate outcome of the legal challenges and the regulatory process of the EPA, or whether Oregon will continue to develop an implementation plan in light of recent activities.  The Company continues to monitor the developments around the potential new rule. 19 Table of Contents The State of Oregon established a non-binding policy guideline that sets a goal to reduce GHG emissions to 10% below 1990 levels by 2020 and at least 75% below 1990 levels by 2050. Although the guideline does not mandate reductions by any specific entity, nor include penalties for failure to meet the goal, the Company is required to report to the DEQ the amount of GHG emissions produced along with the total amount of energy produced or purchased by PGE for consumption in Oregon. State of Oregon legislators have proposed Senate Bill 1070 referred to as the Clean Energy Jobs Bill in an effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to climate change through a statewide cap and trade program. This proposal is under consideration in the 35-day legislative session that began in early February. The program would set a statewide cap on greenhouse gas emissions that is reduced over time and would require about 100 companies, including PGE, to acquire permits for the greenhouse gas emissions they produce. PGE continues to monitor the status of this proposed legislation. Any laws that would impose emissions taxes or mandatory reductions in GHG emissions may have a material impact on PGE's operations, as the Company utilizes fossil fuels in its own power generation and other companies use such fuels to generate power that PGE purchases in the wholesale market. PGE's natural gas-fired facilities, Beaver, Coyote Springs, PW1 and PW2, Carty, and the Company's ownership interest in coal-fired facilities, Boardman and Colstrip, provided, in total, approximately 69% of the Company's net generating capacity at December 31, 2017. If PGE were to incur incremental costs as a result of changes in the regulations regarding GHGs, the Company would seek recovery in customer prices. Oregon Clean Electricity and Coal Transition Plan - The State of Oregon passed Senate Bill 1547, effective March 8, 2016. The legislation prevents large utilities from including the costs and benefits associated with coal-fired generation in their Oregon retail rates after 2030. For more information regarding the OCEP, and its impact on PGE, see the ""Legal, Regulatory, and Environmental Matters"" section of Item 7. - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Water Quality The federal Clean Water Act requires that any federal license or permit to conduct an activity that may result in a discharge to waters of the United States must first receive a water quality certification from the state in which the activity will occur. In Oregon, Montana, and Washington, the Departments of Environmental Quality are responsible for reviewing proposed projects under this requirement to ensure that federally approved activities will meet water quality standards and policies established by the respective state. PGE has obtained permits where required, and has certificates of compliance for its hydroelectric operations under the FERC licenses. The Company is subject to litigation with regard to water quality conditions on the Deschutes River. For additional information on this litigation see ""Deschutes River Alliance Clean Water Act Claims"" in see Note 17, Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. - ""Financial Statements and Supplementary Data."" Threatened and Endangered Species and Wildlife Fish Protection - The federal Endangered Species Act (ESA) has granted protection to many populations of migratory fish species in the Pacific Northwest that have declined significantly over the last several decades. Long-term recovery plans for these species continue to have operational impacts on many of the region's hydroelectric projects. PGE purchases power in the wholesale market, some of which is sourced from other affected hydroelectric facilities in the Pacific Northwest, to serve its retail load requirements. In addition, the Company has contracts to purchase power generated at some of the affected facilities on the mid-Columbia River in central Washington. PGE continues to implement fish protection measures at its hydroelectric projects on the Clackamas, Deschutes, and Willamette rivers that were prescribed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) and the National Marine Fisheries Service under their authority granted in the ESA and the FPA. As a result of measures contained in their operating licenses, the Deschutes River and Willamette River projects have been certified as low impact hydro, with a total of 50 MWa of output from those facilities included as part of the Company's renewable energy portfolio used 20 Table of Contents to meet the requirements of the RPS. Conditions required with the operating licenses are expected to result in a minor reduction in power production and continued capital spending to modify the facilities to enhance fish passage and survival. Avian Protection - Various statutes, including the Migratory Bird Treaty Act and Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act, contain provisions for civil, criminal, and administrative penalties resulting from the unauthorized take of migratory birds and eagles. Because PGE operates facilities that can pose risks to a variety of such birds, the Company developed an avian protection plan to help address and reduce risks to bird species that may be affected by Company operations. PGE has implemented such a plan for its transmission, distribution, and thermal generation facilities and continues to finalize similar plans, for its wind generation facilities. In 2015, PGE submitted an application, along with a draft Eagle Conservation Plan, to the USFWS, pertaining to Biglow Canyon that would address the incidental take of eagles, and submitted a similar draft application for Tucannon River in 2017. Hazardous Material PGE has a comprehensive program to comply with requirements of both federal and state regulations related to the storage, handling, and disposal of hazardous materials. The handling and disposal of hazardous materials from Company facilities is subject to regulation under the federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA). In addition, the use, disposal, and clean-up of polychlorinated biphenyls, contained in certain electrical equipment, are regulated under the federal Toxic Substances Control Act. The generation of electricity at Boardman and Colstrip produces a by-product known as coal combustion residuals (CCRs), which have historically not been considered hazardous materials under the RCRA. In December 2014, the EPA signed a final rule, which became effective in October 2015, to regulate CCRs under the RCRA. Boardman produces dry CCRs that have historically been disposed at an on-site landfill, which is permitted and regulated by the State of Oregon under requirements similar to the CCR rule. PGE has determined that it will continue use of the on-site landfill in compliance with the CCR rule, and the Company believes the CCR rule will not have a material effect on operations at Boardman. Based on information from the Colstrip operator, the CCR rule will have an effect on operations at Colstrip, which produces wet CCRs, and as a result, in 2015 PGE updated its Asset Retirement Obligation and adjusted its cost assumptions, accordingly. For further information, see Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and ""Utility plant"" in Note 7, Asset Retirement Obligations, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. - ""Financial Statements and Supplementary Data."" PGE is also subject to regulation under the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act, commonly referred to as Superfund, which provides authority to the EPA to assert joint and several liability for investigation and remediation costs for designated Superfund sites. An investigation by the EPA that began in 1997 of a segment of the Willamette River in Oregon known as Portland Harbor, has revealed significant contamination of river sediments and prompted the EPA to subsequently include Portland Harbor on the federal National Priority List as a Superfund site. The EPA has listed PGE among the more than one hundred Potentially Responsible Parties (PRPs) in this matter, as PGE has historically owned or operated property near the river. On January 6, 2017, the EPA issued a Record of Decision (ROD), which outlined the EPA's selected remediation alternative to clean-up Portland Harbor. The estimated total cost of the remedy had a discounted present value of $1.05 billion with an estimated remediation period of 13 years. PGE is participating in a voluntary process to determine an appropriate allocation of costs amongst the PRPs. Certain PRPs have entered an agreement with the EPA to conduct further sampling in the river in an attempt to refine the remediation needed. PGE is not among those parties. Significant uncertainties remain surrounding facts and circumstances that are integral to the determination of such an allocation percentage, including a final allocation methodology and data with regard to property specific activities and history of ownership of sites within Portland Harbor. Based on the above facts and remaining uncertainties, PGE cannot reasonably estimate its potential liability. 21 Table of Contents In July 2016, the Company filed a deferral application with the OPUC seeking the deferral of the future environmental remediation costs, as well as, seeking authorization to establish a regulatory cost recovery mechanism for such environmental costs. The Company reached an agreement with OPUC Staff and other parties regarding the details of the recovery mechanism, which the OPUC approved in the first quarter of 2017. The mechanism will allow the Company to defer and recover incurred environmental expenditures through a combination of third-party proceeds, such as insurance recoveries, and through customer prices, as necessary. The mechanism establishes annual prudency reviews of environmental expenditures and is subject to an annual earnings test. For additional information regarding the EPA action on Portland Harbor, see Note 17, Contingencies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. - ""Financial Statements and Supplementary Data."" Under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, the USDOE is responsible for the permanent storage and disposal of spent nuclear fuel. PGE has contracted with the USDOE for permanent disposal of spent nuclear fuel from Trojan that is stored in the Independent Spent Fuel Storage Installation (ISFSI), an NRC-licensed interim dry storage facility that houses the fuel at the former plant site. The spent nuclear fuel is expected to remain in the ISFSI until permanent off-site storage is available. Shipment of the spent nuclear fuel from the ISFSI to off-site storage is not expected to be completed prior to 2034. For additional information regarding this matter, see ""Trojan decommissioning activities"" in Note 7, Asset Retirement Obligations, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. - ""Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.""","ITEM 1A.     RISK FACTORS. Certain risks and uncertainties that could have a significant impact on PGE's business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows, or that may cause the Company's actual results to vary materially from the forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, include those set forth below. Recovery of PGE's costs is subject to regulatory review and approval, and the inability to recover costs may adversely affect the Company's results of operations. The prices that PGE charges for its retail services, as authorized by the OPUC, are a major factor in determining the Company's operating income, financial position, liquidity, and credit ratings. As a general matter, PGE seeks to recover in customer prices most of the costs incurred in connection with the operation of its business, including, among other things, costs related to capital projects (such as the construction of new facilities or the modification of existing facilities), the costs of compliance with legislative and regulatory requirements and the costs of damage from storms and other natural disasters. However, there can be no assurance that such recovery will be granted. The OPUC has the authority to disallow the recovery of any costs that it considers imprudently incurred. Although the OPUC is required to establish customer prices that are fair, just and reasonable, it has significant discretion in the interpretation of this standard. PGE attempts to manage its costs at levels consistent with the OPUC approved prices. However, if the Company is unable to do so, or if such cost management results in increased operational risk, the Company's financial and operating results could be adversely affected. Economic conditions that result in reduced demand for electricity and impair the financial stability of some of PGE's customers, could affect the Company's results of operations. Unfavorable economic conditions in Oregon may result in reduced demand for electricity. Such reductions in demand could adversely affect PGE's results of operations and cash flows. Economic conditions could also result in an increased level of uncollectible customer accounts and cause the Company's vendors and service providers to experience cash flow problems and be unable to perform under existing or future contracts. 22 Table of Contents Market prices for power and natural gas are subject to forces that are often not predictable and which can result in price volatility and general market disruption, adversely affecting PGE's costs and ability to manage its energy portfolio and procure required energy supply, which ultimately could have an adverse effect on the Company's liquidity and results of operations. As part of its normal business operations, PGE purchases power and natural gas in the open market under short- and long-term contracts, which may specify variable prices or volumes. Market prices for power and natural gas are influenced primarily by factors related to supply and demand. These factors generally include the adequacy of generating capacity, scheduled and unscheduled outages of generating facilities, hydroelectric and wind generation levels, prices and availability of fuel sources for generation, disruptions or constraints to transmission facilities, weather conditions, economic growth, and changes in technology. Volatility in these markets can affect the availability, price and demand for power and natural gas. Disruption in power and natural gas markets could result in a deterioration of market liquidity, increase the risk of counterparty default, affect regulatory and legislative processes in unpredictable ways, affect wholesale power prices, and impair PGE's ability to manage its energy portfolio. Changes in power and natural gas prices can also affect the fair value of derivative instruments and cash requirements to purchase power and natural gas. If power and natural gas prices decrease from those contained in the Company's existing purchased power and natural gas agreements, PGE may be required to provide increased collateral, which could adversely affect the Company's liquidity. Conversely, if power and natural gas prices rise, especially during periods when the Company requires greater-than-expected volumes that must be purchased at market or short-term prices, PGE could incur greater costs than originally estimated. The risk of volatility in power costs is partially mitigated through the AUT and the PCAM. Application of the PCAM requires that PGE absorb certain power cost increases before the Company is allowed to recover any amount from customers. Accordingly, the PCAM is expected to only partially mitigate the potentially adverse financial impacts of forced generating plant outages, reduced hydro and wind availability, interruptions in fuel supplies, and volatile wholesale energy prices. The effects of weather on electricity usage can adversely affect results of operations. Weather conditions can adversely affect PGE's revenues and costs, impacting the Company's results of operations. Variations in temperatures can affect customer demand for electricity, with warmer-than-normal winter seasons or cooler-than-normal summer seasons reducing the demand for energy. Weather conditions are the dominant cause of usage variations from normal seasonal patterns, particularly for residential customers. Severe weather can also disrupt energy delivery and damage the Company's transmission and distribution system. Rapid increases in load requirements resulting from unexpected adverse weather changes, particularly if coupled with transmission constraints, could adversely impact PGE's cost and ability to meet the energy needs of its customers. Conversely, rapid decreases in load requirements could result in the sale of excess energy at depressed market prices. Forced outages at PGE's generating plants can increase the cost of power required to serve customers because the cost of replacement power purchased in the wholesale market generally exceeds the Company's cost of generation. Forced outages at the Company's generating plants could result in power costs greater than those included in customer prices. As indicated above, application of the Company's PCAM could help mitigate adverse financial impacts of such outages; however, the cost sharing features of the mechanism do not provide full recovery in customer prices. Inability to recover such costs in future prices could have a negative impact on the Company's results of operations. 23 Table of Contents The construction of new facilities, or modifications to existing facilities, is subject to risks that could result in the disallowance of certain costs for recovery in customer prices or higher operating costs. PGE supplements its own generation with wholesale power purchases to meet its retail load requirement. In addition, long-term increases in both the number of customers and demand for energy will require continued expansion and upgrade of PGE's generation, transmission, and distribution systems. Construction of new facilities and modifications to existing facilities could be affected by various factors, including unanticipated delays and cost increases and the failure to obtain, or delay in obtaining, necessary permits from state or federal agencies or tribal entities, which could result in failure to complete the projects and the disallowance of certain costs in the rate determination process. In addition, failure to complete construction projects according to specifications could result in reduced plant efficiency, equipment failure, and plant performance that falls below expected levels, which could increase operating costs. Adverse changes in PGE's credit ratings could negatively affect its access to the capital markets and its cost of borrowed funds. Access to capital markets is important to PGE's ability to operate its business and complete its capital projects. Credit rating agencies evaluate the Company's credit ratings on a periodic basis and when certain events occur. A ratings downgrade could increase fees on PGE's revolving credit facilities and letter of credit facilities, increasing the cost of funding day-to-day working capital requirements, and could also result in higher interest rates on future long-term debt. A ratings downgrade could also restrict the Company's access to the commercial paper market, a principal source of short-term financing, or result in higher interest costs. In addition, if Moody's Investors Service (Moody's) and/or S&P Global Ratings (S&P) reduce their rating on PGE's unsecured debt to below investment grade, the Company could be subject to requests by certain wholesale counterparties to post additional performance assurance collateral, which could have an adverse effect on the Company's liquidity. PGE is subject to various legal and regulatory proceedings, the outcome of which is uncertain, and resolution unfavorable to PGE could adversely affect the Company's results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows. From time to time in the normal course of its business, PGE is subject to various regulatory proceedings, lawsuits, claims, and other matters, which could result in adverse judgments, settlements, fines, penalties, injunctions, or other relief. These matters are subject to many uncertainties, the ultimate outcome of which management cannot predict. The final resolution of certain matters in which PGE is involved could require that the Company incur expenditures over an extended period of time and in a range of amounts that could have an adverse effect on its cash flows and results of operations. Similarly, the terms of resolution could require the Company to change its business practices and procedures, which could also have an adverse effect on its cash flows, financial position, or results of operations. There are certain pending legal and regulatory proceedings, such as the remediation efforts related to the Portland Harbor site and the Carty related litigation and cost recovery, which may have an adverse effect on results of operations and cash flows for future reporting periods. For additional information, see Item 3. - ""Legal Proceedings"" and Note 17, Contingencies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. - ""Financial Statements and Supplementary Data."" 24 Table of Contents Reduced river flows and unfavorable wind conditions can adversely affect generation from hydroelectric and wind generating resources. The Company could be required to replace energy expected from these sources with higher cost power from other facilities or with wholesale market purchases, which could have an adverse effect on results of operations. PGE derives a significant portion of its power supply from its own hydroelectric facilities and through long-term purchase contracts with certain public utility districts in the state of Washington. Regional rainfall and snow pack levels affect river flows and the resulting amount of energy generated by these facilities. Shortfalls in energy expected from lower cost hydroelectric generating resources would require increased energy from the Company's other generating resources and/or power purchases in the wholesale market, which could have an adverse effect on results of operations. PGE also derives a portion of its power supply from wind generating resources, for which the output is dependent upon wind conditions. Unfavorable wind conditions could require increased reliance on power from the Company's thermal generating resources or power purchases in the wholesale market, both of which could have an adverse effect on results of operations. Although the application of the PCAM could help mitigate adverse financial effects from any decrease in power provided by hydroelectric and wind generating resources, full recovery of any increase in power costs is not assured. Inability to fully recover such costs in future prices could have a negative impact on the Company's results of operations, as well as a reduction in renewable energy credits and loss of production tax credits related to wind generating resources. Capital and credit market conditions could adversely affect the Company's access to capital, cost of capital, and ability to execute its strategic plan as currently envisioned. Access to capital and credit markets is important to PGE's ability to operate. The Company expects to issue debt and equity securities, as necessary, to fund its future capital requirements. In addition, contractual commitments and regulatory requirements may limit the Company's ability to delay or terminate certain projects. If the capital and credit market conditions in the United States and other parts of the world deteriorate, the Company's future cost of debt and equity capital, as well as access to capital markets, could be adversely affected. In addition, restrictions on PGE's ability to access capital markets could affect its ability to execute its strategic plan. Legislative or regulatory efforts to reduce GHG emissions could lead to increased capital and operating costs and have an adverse impact on the Company's results of operations. Future legislation or regulations could result in limitations on GHG emissions from the Company's fossil fuel-fired generation facilities. Compliance with any GHG emissions reduction requirements could require PGE to incur significant expenditures, including those related to carbon capture and sequestration technology, purchase of emission allowances and offsets, fuel switching, and the replacement of high-emitting generation facilities with lower-emitting facilities. The cost to comply with potential GHG emissions reduction requirements is subject to significant uncertainties, including those related to: i) the timing of the implementation of emissions reduction rules; ii) required levels of emissions reductions; iii) requirements with respect to the allocation of emissions allowances; iv) the maturation, regulation, and commercialization of carbon capture and sequestration technology; and v) PGE's compliance alternatives. Although the Company cannot currently estimate the effect of future legislation or regulations on its results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows, the costs of compliance with such legislation or regulations could be material. 25 Table of Contents Changes in tax laws may have an adverse impact on the Company's financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. PGE makes judgments and interpretations about the application of tax law when determining the provision for taxes. Such judgments include the timing and probability of recognition of income, deductions, and tax credits, which are subject to challenge by taxing authorities. Additionally, treatment of tax benefits and costs for ratemaking purposes could be different than what the Company anticipates or requests from the state regulatory commission, which could have a negative effect on the Company's financial condition and results of operations. PGE owns and operates wind generating facilities, which generate Production Tax Credits (PTCs) that PGE uses to reduce its federal tax obligations. The amount of PTCs earned depends on the level of electricity output generated and the applicable tax credit rate. A variety of operating and economic parameters, including adverse weather conditions and equipment reliability, could significantly reduce the PTCs generated by the Company's wind facilities resulting in a material adverse impact on PGE's financial condition and results of operations. These PTCs generate tax credit carryforwards that the Company plans to utilize in the future to reduce income tax obligations. If PGE cannot generate enough taxable income in the future to utilize all of the tax credit carryforwards before the credits expire, the Company may incur material charges to earnings. Under certain circumstances, banks participating in PGE's credit facilities could decline to fund advances requested by the Company or could withdraw from participation in the credit facilities. PGE currently has a syndicated unsecured revolving credit facility with several banks for an aggregate amount of $500 million. The revolving credit facility provides a primary source of liquidity and may be used to supplement operating cash flow and as backup for commercial paper borrowings. The revolving credit facility represents commitments by the participating banks to make loans and, in certain cases, to issue letters of credit. The Company is required to make certain representations to the banks each time it requests an advance under the credit facility. However, in the event certain circumstances occur that could result in a material adverse change in the business, financial condition, or results of operations of PGE, the Company may not be able to make such representations, in which case the banks would not be required to lend. PGE is also subject to the risk that one or more of the participating banks may default on their obligation to make loans under the credit facility. Measures required to comply with state and federal regulations related to air emissions and water discharges from thermal generating plants could result in increased capital expenditures and operating costs and reduce generating capacity, which could adversely affect the Company's results of operations. PGE is subject to state and federal requirements concerning air emissions and water discharges from thermal generating plants. For additional information, see the Environmental Matters section in Item 1. - ""Business."" These requirements could adversely affect the Company's results of operations by requiring: i) the installation of additional air emissions and water discharge controls at PGE's generating plants, which could result in increased capital expenditures; and ii) changes to the Company's operations that could increase operating costs and reduce generating capacity. Adverse capital market performance could result in reductions in the fair value of benefit plan assets and increase the Company's liabilities related to such plans. Sustained declines in the fair value of the plans' assets could result in significant increases in funding requirements, which could adversely affect PGE's liquidity and results of operations. Performance of the capital markets affects the value of assets that are held in trust to satisfy future obligations under PGE's defined benefit pension plan. Sustained adverse market performance could result in lower rates of return for these assets than projected by the Company and could increase PGE's funding requirements related to the pension plan. Additionally, changes in interest rates affect PGE's liabilities under the pension plan. As interest rates decrease, the Company's liabilities increase, potentially requiring additional funding. 26 Table of Contents Performance of the capital markets also affects the fair value of assets that are held in trust to satisfy future obligations under the Company's non-qualified employee benefit plans, which include deferred compensation plans. As changes in the fair value of these assets are recorded in current earnings, decreases can adversely affect the Company's operating results. In addition, such decreases can require that PGE make additional payments to satisfy its obligations under these plans. Development of alternative technologies may negatively impact the value of PGE's generation facilities. A basic premise of PGE's business is that generating electricity at central generation facilities achieves economies of scale and produces electricity at a relatively low price. Many companies and organizations conduct research and development activities to seek improvements in alternative technologies, such as fuel cells, photovoltaic (solar) cells, micro-turbines, and other forms of distributed generation. It is possible that advances in such technologies will reduce the cost of alternative methods of electricity production to a level that is equal to or below that of central thermal and wind generation facilities. Such a development could limit the Company's future growth opportunities and limit growth in demand for PGE's electric service. Failure of PGE's wholesale suppliers to perform their contractual obligations could adversely affect the Company's ability to deliver electricity and increase the Company's costs. PGE relies on suppliers to deliver natural gas, coal, and electricity, in accordance with short- and long-term contracts. Failure of suppliers to comply with such contracts in a timely manner could disrupt the Company's ability to deliver electricity and require PGE to incur additional expenses in order to meet the needs of its customers. In addition, as these contracts expire, the Company could be unable to continue to purchase natural gas, coal, or electricity on terms and conditions equivalent to those of existing agreements. Operational changes required to comply with both existing and new environmental laws related to fish and wildlife could adversely affect PGE's results of operations. A portion of PGE's total energy requirement is supplied with power generated from hydroelectric and wind generating resources. Operation of these facilities is subject to regulation related to the protection of fish and wildlife. The listing of various plants and species of fish, birds, and other wildlife as threatened or endangered has resulted in significant operational changes to these projects. Salmon recovery plans could include further major operational changes to the region's hydroelectric projects, including those owned by PGE and those from which the Company purchases power under long-term contracts. In addition, laws relating to the protection of migratory birds and other wildlife could impact the development and operation of transmission and distribution lines and wind projects. Also, new interpretations of existing laws and regulations could be adopted or become applicable to such facilities, which could further increase required expenditures for salmon recovery and endangered species protection and reduce the availability of hydroelectric or wind generating resources to meet the Company's energy requirements. PGE could be vulnerable to cyber security attacks, data security breaches, acts of terrorism, or other similar events that could disrupt its operations, require significant expenditures, or result in claims against the Company. In the normal course of business, PGE collects, processes, and retains sensitive and confidential customer and employee information, as well as proprietary business information, and operates systems that directly impact the availability of electric power and the transmission of electric power in its service territory. Despite the security measures in place, the Company's systems, and those of third-party service providers, could be vulnerable to cyber security attacks, data security breaches, acts of terrorism, or other similar events that could disrupt operations or result in the release of sensitive or confidential information. Such events could cause a shutdown of service or expose PGE to liability. In addition, the Company may be required to expend significant capital and other resources to protect against security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by security breaches. PGE maintains insurance coverage against some, but not all, potential losses resulting from these risks. However, insurance may not be 27 Table of Contents adequate to protect the Company against liability in all cases. In addition, PGE is subject to the risk that insurers will dispute or be unable to perform their obligations to the Company. Storms and other natural disasters could damage the Company's facilities and disrupt delivery of electricity resulting in significant property loss, repair costs, and reduced customer satisfaction. PGE has exposure to natural disasters that can cause significant damage to its generation, transmission, and distribution facilities. Such events can interrupt the delivery of electricity, increase repair and service restoration expenses, and reduce revenues. Such events, if repeated or prolonged, can also affect customer satisfaction and the level of regulatory oversight. As a regulated utility, the Company is required to provide service to all customers within its service territory and generally has been afforded liability protection against customer claims related to service failures beyond the Company's reasonable control. PGE is subject to extensive regulation that affects the Company's operations and costs. PGE is subject to regulation by the FERC, the OPUC, and by certain federal, state, and local authorities under environmental and other laws. Such regulation significantly influences the Company's operating environment and can have an effect on many aspects of its business. Changes to regulations are ongoing, and the Company cannot predict with certainty the future course of such changes or the ultimate effect that they might have on its business. However, changes in regulations could delay or adversely affect business planning and transactions, and substantially increase the Company's costs.","ITEM 7.

Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which such statement is made, and, except as required by law, PGE undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which such statement is made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. New factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for management to predict all such factors or assess the impact of any such factor on the business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statement. Overview Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) is intended to provide an understanding of the business environment, results of operations, and financial condition of PGE. MD&A should be read in conjunction with the Company's consolidated financial statements contained in this report, and other periodic and current reports filed with the SEC. PGE is responding proactively to an evolving landscape of customer expectations, technology changes, and regulatory frameworks by focusing efforts on four strategic initiatives: 1) delivering exceptional customer service, 2) investing in a reliable and clean energy future, 3) building a smarter, more resilient grid and 4) pursuing excellence in its work. Delivering exceptional customer service requires PGE to be responsive to the changing expectations of our growing customer base. PGE's IRP, 2019 GRC, customer information system, and planned infrastructure investments are part of a strategy focused on providing power supply, distribution reliability, and customer service that meet these expectations. PGE's investments in a reliable and clean energy future are a key element of the IRP, which will require compliance with statutory renewable standards and consideration of state and local government initiatives to decarbonize the local economy. Building a smarter, more resilient grid is essential to affordably delivering the clean energy future that customers want. This requires embracing new technologies, modernizing the Company's existing infrastructure, and implementing a new customer information system to create a foundation to integrate emerging technologies. PGE's capital requirements contemplate the impact of making these improvements to its transmission, distribution, and information technology infrastructure. 33 Table of Contents The discussion that follows in this MD&A more fully describes these and other operating activities and provides additional information related to the Company's legal, regulatory, and environmental matters, results of operations, and liquidity and financing. Integrated Resource Plans - PGE's 2016 IRP (2016 IRP) was filed with the OPUC in November 2016 and outlines the Company's plan to meet future customer demand and describes PGE's future energy supply strategy. The 2016 IRP addressed acquisition of additional resources to meet RPS requirements and replace energy and capacity from Boardman, which will cease coal-fired operations at the end of 2020. Further actions identified through 2021 are expected to offset expiring power purchase agreements and integrate variable energy resources, such as wind or solar generation facilities. The 2016 IRP is available on PGE's website. All portfolios analyzed in the 2016 IRP pursued:  Compliance with the RPS through 2050;  Inclusion of cost-effective customer-side options, including energy efficiency, demand response, conservation voltage reduction, and dispatchable standby generation; and  Retention of all existing power plants until 2050, with the exception of Boardman and Colstrip Units 3 & 4. The 2016 IRP also considered the effects of a law referred to as the Oregon Clean Electricity and Coal Transition Plan (OCEP), which, among other things, increased the RPS requirements for 2025 and future years. For further information on the OCEP, see the ""Legal, Regulatory, and Environmental"" section of the Overview section in Item 7. - ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations."" In August 2017, the OPUC acknowledged PGE's 2016 IRP and the following primary action plan items:  Meet additional capacity needs of 561 MW, of which 240 MW must be dispatchable, in 2021;  Acquire a total of 135 MWa of cost-effective energy efficiency;  Acquire at least 77 MW (winter) and 69 MW (summer) demand response through 2020 and 16 MW of dispatchable standby generation from customers to help manage peak load conditions and other supply contingencies;  Deploy 1 MWa of conservation voltage reduction through 2020;  Submit one or more energy storage proposals in accordance with Oregon House Bill 2193, by January 1, 2018; and  Perform various research and studies related to flexible capacity and curtailment metrics, customer insights, decarbonization, risks associated with Direct Access, treatment of market capacity, access to resources from Montana, and improvements to load forecasting. The State of Oregon continues to promote a decarbonized economy that initially began with the decision to cease coal-fired generation at Boardman by the end of 2020. As part of the 2016 IRP, the Company put forth a variety of scenarios in which it envisioned replacement of the output of Boardman. As a result of the public review process, the Company has pursued bilateral contract arrangements with capacity providers in the region. Additional contract requests from Qualifying Facilities have also reduced the need for the Company to build new generation. Capacity - In August 2017, the Company filed with the OPUC a request for a waiver of the OPUC's competitive bidding guidelines. In that filing, PGE requested a waiver to procure capacity to partially satisfy PGE's capacity needs. The OPUC approved the waiver request in December 2017 and PGE has now finalized bilateral power purchase agreements, summarized as follows:  200 MW of annual capacity with five-year terms beginning January 1, 2021; and  100 MW of seasonal peak capacity during the summer and winter seasons with a term that would begin July 1, 2019 and continue through February 29, 2024. 34 Table of Contents Renewables - The OPUC, in its August 2017 acknowledgement, asked the Company to work with OPUC staff and parties to prepare and submit a revised proposal for acquiring renewable resources. In the fourth quarter of 2017, PGE submitted to the OPUC an addendum to the 2016 IRP, which proposed a 100 MWa procurement target for the addition of RPS compliant renewable resources and included a request for the issuance of an RFP for renewable resources. In December 2017, the OPUC acknowledged the addendum and, as a result, the Company plans to move forward with the procurement of additional renewable resources during 2018. The RFP process will include oversight by an independent evaluator and review by the OPUC. Since issuing the 2016 IRP, PGE has identified a potential benchmark wind resource that could have a nameplate capacity of up to 300 MW that would meet the acknowledged need for renewable resources and qualify for the federal production tax credit. The Company continues to explore this option and should due diligence be completed and agreements reached, the potential benchmark resource would be submitted into the RFP and considered along with other renewable resource proposals. Energy Storage - Pursuant to OPUC acknowledgment of the 2016 IRP, and in accordance with Oregon House Bill 2193, PGE filed an energy storage proposal in November 2017. The proposal calls for 39 MW of storage to be developed over the next several years at various locations across the grid, at a cost of $50 to $100 million. IRP Update - The Company plans to file an update to its 2016 IRP in March 2018. As part of the IRP Update filing, PGE's capacity need will have been updated to reflect the bilateral capacity contracts, changes to load forecast, and additional Qualified Facilities executed contracts. The remaining capacity need of approximately 100 MW is expected to be filled through contributions from the acquisition of energy storage, incremental renewables procured through an RFP, contracts with Qualifying Facilities, and market purchases. General Rate Cases - On February 15, 2018, PGE filed with the OPUC a general rate case based on a 2019 test year (2019 GRC). After adjusting for the effects of tax reform, the Company's filing requests an approximate 4.8% overall increase relative to currently approved prices and would result in an $86 million increase in the annual revenue requirement. The filing seeks recovery of costs related to better serving customers and building a smarter, more resilient system and includes the expectation of higher net variable power costs in 2019. Primary elements include:  A new customer information system to provide better, more secure service;  Replacement and upgrades to equipment to ensure system safety and reliability;  Equipping substations with technology to address potential outages and shorten those that do occur;  Strengthening safeguards that protect against cyber attacks and other potential threats; and  Adding infrastructure to support rapid growth in the region. The net increase in annual revenue requirement is based upon:  A capital structure of 50% debt and 50% equity;  A return on equity of 9.50%  A cost of capital of 7.31%, and  A rate base of $4.86 billion. Regulatory review of the 2019 GRC will continue throughout 2018, with a final order targeted to be issued by the OPUC by December 2018. New customer prices are expected to become effective January 1, 2019. On January 1, 2018, new customer prices went into effect pursuant to the OPUC order issued on PGE's 2018 GRC, which was based on a 2018 test year and included recovery of costs related to upgrades to PGE's transmission and 35 Table of Contents distribution system, investments in strengthening and safeguarding the grid, and base business costs. The OPUC authorized a $16 million increase in annual revenues, representing an approximate 1% overall increase in customer prices. In addition, the order approved a capital structure of 50% debt and 50% equity, return on equity of 9.50%, cost of capital of 7.35%, and rate base of $4.5 billion. The general rate case filings, as well as copies of the orders, direct testimony, exhibits, and stipulations are available on the OPUC website at www.oregon.gov/puc. Tax Reform - On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the TCJA) was enacted and signed into law by the President of the United States with substantially all of the provisions of the TCJA having an effective date of January 1, 2018. Among other provisions, the reduction of the federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, which required the Company to remeasure its existing deferred income tax balances as of December 31, 2017, had the most impact on PGE's financial condition. As a result of the Company's remeasurement, net deferred tax liabilities on the Company's consolidated balance sheets were reduced by $340 million. Of the remeasurement amount, $357 million has been deferred as a regulatory liability and is expected to be refunded to customers over time. These deferred tax items relate primarily to Electric utility plant and other rate base items subject to tax normalization rules that require the benefits to be passed on to customers through future prices over the remaining useful life of the underlying assets for which the deferred income taxes relate. The Company plans to use the average rate assumption method to account for the refund to customers. A portion of the remeasurement is not subject to tax normalization rules and will be amortized over time. The remaining and offsetting remeasurement amount of $17 million represents a reduction to net deferred tax assets related to other business items, primarily comprised of deferred tax assets related to the Company's non-qualified employee benefit plans. The Company has recorded a $17 million charge to the results of operations, reflected as an increase in Income tax expense in the Company's consolidated statements of income for the period ended December 31, 2017. As a result of the TCJA, PGE expects to incur lower income tax expense in 2018 than what was estimated in setting customer prices in the Company's 2018 GRC. In addition to the effects of the 2017 remeasurement of deferred income taxes, PGE has proposed to defer and refund the 2018 expected net benefits of the TCJA under a deferral application filed with the OPUC on December 29, 2017. If approved as requested, any refund to customers of the net benefits associated with the TCJA in 2018 would be subject to an earnings test and limited by the Company's previously authorized regulated return on equity. Other specific provisions in the TCJA that relate to regulated public utilities include general allowance for the continued deductibility of interest expense, and continued normalization requirements for accelerated depreciation benefits. These other provisions are not expected to have a material impact on the Company's financial condition, results of operation, or cash flows. For more information regarding the Company's proposed deferral application, see the ""Legal, Regulatory, and Environmental Matters"" Section of this Item 7. Capital Requirements and Financing - PGE's capital requirements amounted to $511 million for 2017, with $49 million related to the customer information system, excluding AFDC. The remainder of the 2017 capital requirements related to ongoing capital expenditures for the upgrade, replacement, and expansion of transmission, distribution, and generation infrastructure, as well as technology enhancements and expenditures related to hydro licensing and construction. In addition, the Company repaid $150 million of debt that was due to mature in November 2017. During 2017, the combination of cash from operations in the amount of $597 million and proceeds from issuances of FMBs in the amount of $225 million funded the Company's capital requirements. Capital requirements in 2018 are expected to approximate $551 million. PGE plans to fund the 2018 capital requirements with cash from operations during 2018, which is expected to range from $575 million to $625 million and the issuance of debt securities of up to $100 million. For further information, see the ""Liquidity"" and the ""Debt and Equity Financings"" sections of this Item 7. Operating Activities - PGE, as a vertically-integrated electric utility, engages in the generation, transmission, distribution, and sale of electricity to retail customers within in its approved service territory in the State of Oregon. In addition, the Company purchases and sells electricity in the wholesale market to meet its retail load requirements. In 2017, the Company began participation in the western EIM, which the Company expects will help integrate more renewable energy into the grid by better matching the variable output of renewable resources. PGE also purchases wholesale natural gas in the United States and Canada to fuel its generating portfolio and sells excess 36 Table of Contents gas back into the wholesale market. The Company generates revenues and cash flows primarily from the sale and distribution of electricity to retail customers. The impact of seasonal weather conditions on demand for electricity can cause the Company's revenues, cash flows, and income from operations to fluctuate from period to period. Historically, PGE has been a winter-peaking utility that typically experiences its highest retail energy demand during the winter heating season. Increased use of air conditioning in the Company's service territory, however, has caused the summer peaks to increase in recent years and the long-term load forecasts indicate summer peaks will exceed winter peaks. PGE's all time summer peak load occurred during August 2017 while the all-time winter peak load was experienced in December 1998. Retail customer price changes and usage patterns, which can be affected by the economy, also have an impact on revenues while wholesale power availability and price, hydro and wind generation, and fuel costs for thermal plants can also affect income from operations. Customers and Demand - In 2017, retail energy deliveries increased 3.9% from 2016. All retail categories contributed to the increase, which was led by residential deliveries, which are most sensitive to fluctuations in weather. For 2017 and 2016, the average number of retail customers and deliveries, by customer type, were as follows: 2017   2016   Increase/ (Decrease) in Energy Deliveries   Average Number of Customers   Energy Deliveries *   Average Number of Customers   Energy Deliveries *   Residential 762,211     7,880     752,365     7,348     7.2  %                     Commercial (PGE sales only) 107,364     6,932     106,460     6,932      -   %      Direct Access 491     623     313     525     18.7  % Total Commercial 107,855     7,555     106,773     7,457     1.3  %                     Industrial (PGE sales only) 199     2,943     195     2,968     (0.8 )%      Direct Access 68     1,340     63     1,198     11.9  % Total Industrial 267     4,283     258     4,166     2.8  %                     Total (PGE sales only) 869,774     17,755     859,020     17,248     2.9  %      Total Direct Access 559     1,963     376     1,723     13.9  % Total 870,333     19,718     859,396     18,971     3.9  % * In thousands of MWh. In 2017, heating degree-days, an indication of electricity use for heating, were 28% greater than 2016, although only 8% above the 15-year average. Heating degree-days in the first quarter of 2017 were unusually high, in contrast to the unseasonably warm weather that occurred in the first quarter of 2016. While heating degree-days totaled near average for the last three quarters of 2017, they continued to be considerably more than experienced during 2016. Cooling degree-days, a similar indication of the extent to which customers are likely to have used electricity for cooling, were 28% above the 2016 level and 48% above the 15-year normal. Residential energy deliveries were 7.2% higher in 2017 than 2016 due to the effects of cooler temperatures during the winter season and warmer temperatures during the summer cooling season, as well as customer growth of 1.3%. See ""Revenues"" in the 2017 Compared to 2016 section of Results of Operations within this Item 7, for further information on heating and cooling degree days. Commercial deliveries also increased by 1.3% as a result of favorable weather conditions and a 1.0 % increase in the average number of customers. The 2.8% increase in industrial energy deliveries is due to continued increases in energy deliveries to the high-tech manufacturing sector. These increases were partially offset by the closure of a large paper customer in October 2017. On a weather-adjusted basis, total retail deliveries decreased 0.6% from 2016 reflecting a 2.2% decline in residential deliveries, as residential usage per customer continues a pattern of long-term decline, a 0.7% reduction in commercial deliveries and an additional day in 2016 due to the leap year. ESSs supplied Direct Access customers with energy representing 10% of the Company's total retail energy deliveries during 2017 and 9% for 2016. The maximum retail load allowed to be supplied under the fixed three-year and minimum five-year opt-out programs represent 13% of the Company's total retail energy deliveries for 2017, and 14% in 2016. Energy efficiency and conservation efforts by retail customers influence demand, although the financial effects of such efforts by residential and certain commercial customers are mitigated through the decoupling mechanism, which is intended to provide for recovery of margin lost as a result of a reduction in electricity sales attributable to energy efficiency and conservation efforts. The mechanism provides for collection from (or refund to) customers if 37 Table of Contents weather-adjusted use per customer is less (or more) than the projected baseline set in the Company's most recent approved general rate case. See ""Legal, Regulatory, and Environmental"" in this Overview section of Item 7, for further information on the decoupling mechanism. For 2017, PGE recorded an estimated collection of $13 million under the mechanism as weather-adjusted energy use per customer was less than that estimated and approved in the Company's 2016 GRC. A final determination of the 2017 estimate will be made by the OPUC through a public filing and review in 2018. Any resulting collection from customers is expected to begin January 1, 2019. The $3 million estimated collection for the 2016 year began January 1, 2018. For 2015, amortization of the net $9 million refund amount occurred in 2017 following a final determination of the amount by the OPUC. Power Operations - PGE utilizes a combination of its own generating resources and wholesale market transactions to meet the energy needs of its retail customers. Based on numerous factors, including plant availability, customer demand, river flows, wind conditions, and current wholesale prices, the Company continuously makes economic dispatch decisions in an effort to obtain reasonably-priced power for its retail customers. As a result, the amount of power generated and purchased in the wholesale market to meet the Company's retail load requirement can vary from period to period. Plant availability is impacted by planned maintenance and forced, or unplanned, outages, during which the respective plant is unavailable to provide power. PGE's thermal generating plants require varying levels of annual maintenance, which is generally performed during the second quarter of the year. Availability of the plants PGE operates approximated 90% for the year ended December 31, 2017, and 93% for 2016, and 2015, with the availability of Colstrip, which PGE does not operate, approximating 86%, 85%, and 93%, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company's generating plants provided approximately 69% of its retail load requirement compared to 70% in 2016 and 65% in 2015. Energy received from PGE-owned hydroelectric plants and under contracts from mid-Columbia hydroelectric projects increased 8% in 2017 compared to 2016, due to more favorable hydro conditions in 2017. These resources provided 18% of the Company's retail load requirement for 2017, compared with 17% for 2016 and 16% for 2015. Energy received from these sources exceeded projected levels included in PGE's AUT by 6% in 2017, did not materially differ from the projections included in the Company's AUT in 2016, and fell short of projections by 7% in 2015. Such projections, which are finalized with the OPUC in November each year, establish the power cost component of retail prices for the following calendar year. Normal hydroelectric conditions represent the level of energy forecasted to be received from hydroelectric resources for the year and is based on average regional hydro conditions over a recent 30-year period. Any shortfall is generally replaced with power from higher cost sources, while any excess in hydro generation from that projected in the AUT generally displaces power from higher cost sources. See ""Purchased power and fuel"" in the 2017 Compared to 2016 section of Results of Operations in this Item 7, for further detail on regional hydro results. Energy expected to be received from wind generating resources (Biglow Canyon and Tucannon River) is projected annually in the AUT based on historical generation. Any excess in wind generation from that projected in the AUT generally displaces power from higher-cost sources, while any shortfall is generally replaced with power from higher-cost sources. Energy received from wind generating resources fell short of that projected in PGE's AUT by 18% in 2017, 7% in 2016, and 15% in 2015. Wind generation forecasts are developed using a 5-year rolling average of historical wind levels or forecast studies when historical data is not available. As a result of the generation shortfalls, production tax credits have not materialized to the extent contemplated in the Company's prices. Pursuant to the Company's PCAM, customer prices can be adjusted to reflect a portion of the difference between each year's forecasted NVPC included in customer prices (baseline NVPC), as established under the AUT, and actual NVPC for the year, to the extent such difference is outside of a pre-determined ""deadband,"" which ranges from $15 million below to $30 million above baseline NVPC. To the extent actual NVPC is above or below the deadband, the PCAM provides for 90% of the variance beyond the deadband to be collected from or refunded to 38 Table of Contents customers, respectively, subject to a regulated earnings test. The following is a summary of the results of the Company's PCAM as calculated for regulatory purposes for 2017, 2016, and 2015:  For 2017, actual NVPC was above baseline NVPC by $15 million, which was within the established deadband range. Accordingly, no estimated collection from customers was recorded as of December 31, 2017. A final determination regarding the 2017 PCAM results will be made by the OPUC through a public filing and review in 2018.  For 2016, actual NVPC was below baseline NVPC by $10 million, which was within the established deadband range. Accordingly, no estimated refund to customers was recorded as of December 31, 2016. A final determination regarding the 2016 PCAM results was made by the OPUC through a public filing and review in 2017, which confirmed no refund to customers pursuant to the PCAM for 2016.  For 2015, actual NVPC was below baseline NVPC by $3 million, which was within the established deadband range. Accordingly, no estimated refund to customers was recorded as of December 31, 2015. A final determination regarding the 2015 PCAM results was made by the OPUC through a public filing and review in 2016, which confirmed no refund to customers pursuant to the PCAM for 2015. For further information concerning the PCAM, see Power Costs under ""State of Oregon Regulation"" in the Regulation section of Item 1. - ""Business."" Western EIM - The Company's participation in the western EIM began October 1, 2017. As a market participant in the western EIM, PGE allows certain of its generating plants to receive automated dispatch signals from the CAISO that allows for load balancing with other western EIM participants in five-minute intervals. The Company expects such load balancing will help integrate more renewable energy into the grid by better matching the variable output of renewable resources. Shortly after the entry into the EIM, PGE began to self-integrate its Company-owned wind generation. Additionally, participation in the western EIM gives PGE access to the lowest-cost energy available in the region to meet changes in real-time energy loads and short-term variations in customer demand. For further information on the Company's participation in the western EIM, see ""Federal Regulation"" in the Regulatory section of Item 1. - ""Business."" Gas Storage - PGE has contractual access to natural gas storage in Mist, Oregon from which it can draw in the event that natural gas supplies are interrupted or if economic factors require its use. The storage facility is owned and operated by a local natural gas company, NW Natural, and may be utilized to provide fuel to PGE's Port Westward Unit 1 and Beaver natural gas-fired generating plants and the Port Westward Unit 2 natural gas-fired flexible capacity generating plant. PGE has entered into a long-term agreement with this gas company to expand the current storage facilities, including the construction of a new reservoir, compressor station, and 13-miles of pipeline, which will collectively be designed to provide no-notice storage services to these PGE generating plants. NW Natural estimates construction will be completed during the winter of 2018-2019, at a cost of approximately $132 million. Due to the level of PGE's involvement during the construction period, the Company is deemed to be the owner of the assets for accounting purposes during the construction period. As a result, PGE has recorded $108 million to construction work-in-progress (CWIP) and a corresponding liability for the same amount to Other noncurrent liabilities in the condensed consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2017. Upon completion of the facility, PGE will assess whether the assets and liabilities qualify as a successful sale-leaseback transaction in which the asset and liability are removed and accounted for as either a capital or operating lease. Carty - Pursuant to the final order issued by the OPUC on November 3, 2015 in connection with the Company's 2016 GRC, the Company was authorized to include in customer prices the capital costs for Carty of up to $514 million, as well as Carty's operating costs, effective August 1, 2016, following the placement of the plant into service on July 29, 2016. As the final construction cost, $637 million, exceeded the amount authorized by the OPUC, higher interest and depreciation expense than allowed in the Company's revenue requirement has resulted. This higher cost of service is primarily due to depreciation and amortization on the incremental capital cost, interest expense, and legal expense, all of which totaled $14 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 and is estimated to be approximately $14 million for the full year 2018. 39 Table of Contents On July 29, 2016, the Company requested from the OPUC a regulatory deferral for the recovery of the revenue requirement associated with the incremental capital costs for Carty starting from its in service date to the date that such amounts are approved in a subsequent GRC proceeding. The Company has requested the OPUC delay its review of this deferral request until the Company's claims against the Sureties have been resolved. Until such time, the effects of this higher cost of service will be recognized in the Company's results of operations. Any amounts approved by the OPUC for recovery under the deferral filing will be recognized in earnings in the period of such approval. For additional details regarding various legal and regulatory proceedings related to Carty, see Note 17, Contingencies, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. - ""Financial Statements and Supplementary Data."" Legal, Regulatory, and Environmental Matters - PGE is a party to certain proceedings, the ultimate outcome of which could have a material impact on the Company's results of operations and cash flows in future reporting periods. Such proceedings include, but are not limited to, matters related to:  An ongoing environmental investigation of Portland Harbor; and  The termination of the Construction Agreement for Carty and recovery of related incremental costs. For additional information regarding the above and other matters, see Note 17, Contingencies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. - ""Financial Statements and Supplementary Data."" Clean Power Plan - In August 2015, the EPA released a final rule, which it calls the Clean Power Plan (CPP). Under the final rule, each state would have to reduce the carbon intensity of its power sector on a state-wide basis by an amount specified by the EPA. The rule established state-specific goals and is intended to result in a reduction of carbon emissions from existing power plants across all states to approximately 32% below 2005 levels by 2030. On February 9, 2016, the United States Supreme Court granted a stay, halting implementation and enforcement of the CPP pending the resolution of legal challenges to the rule. The EPA has proposed repealing the CPP and has stated that the agency will put forward a replacement rule. For additional information regarding this new rule, see ""Air Quality"" in the Environmental Matters section of Item 1. - ""Business."" Oregon Clean Electricity and Coal Transition Plan - The State of Oregon passed Senate Bill 1547, effective in March 2016, a law referred to as the OCEP. The legislation has impacted PGE in several ways, including preventing the Company from including the costs and benefits associated with coal-fired generation in their Oregon retail rates after 2030 (subject to an exception that extends this date until 2035 for PGE's output from the Colstrip facility). As a result, in October 2016, the Company filed a tariff request, and the OPUC approved the request, to incorporate in customer prices, on January 1, 2017, the approximate $6 million annual effect of accelerating recovery of the Colstrip facility from 2042 to 2030, as required under the legislation. Future effects under the new law include:  an increase in RPS thresholds to 27% by 2025, 35% by 2030, 45% by 2035, and 50% by 2040;  a limitation on the life of renewable energy certificates (RECs) generated from facilities that become operational after 2022 to five years, but continued unlimited lifespan for all existing RECs and allowance for the generation of additional unlimited RECs for a period of five years for projects on line before December 31, 2022; and  an allowance for energy storage costs in its renewable adjustment clause mechanism (RAC) filings. The Company has evaluated the potential impacts and incorporated the effects of the legislation into its 2016 IRP. For further information on the OCEP, see ""State of Oregon Regulation"" in the Regulation section of Item 1. - ""Business."" 40 Table of Contents Senate Bill 978 - The State of Oregon legislature passed a bill in its 2017 session referred to as SB 978, which directs the OPUC to investigate and provide a report to the legislature by September 15, 2018 on how developing industry trends, technology, and policy drivers in the electricity sector might impact the existing regulatory system and incentives. PGE is actively working on this initiative, both internally and in conjunction with the OPUC, to provide guidance and support development of the report. The OPUC recently opened a proceeding to collect input on possible changes to the regulatory model from stakeholders including regulated utilities such as PGE. Senate Bill 1070 - The State of Oregon legislators have proposed Senate Bill 1070 referred to as the Clean Energy Jobs Bill in an effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to climate change through a statewide cap and trade program. This will be discussed in the 35-day legislative session that began in February. The program would set a statewide cap on greenhouse gas emissions that is reduced over time and would require about 100 companies, including PGE, to acquire permits for the greenhouse gas emissions they produce. PGE continues to monitor the status of this proposed legislation. Recovery of Utility License Fees - In May 2011, the city of Gresham, Oregon (Gresham), which is within PGE's service territory, adopted a resolution to increase utility license fees from 5% to 7%, effective July 1, 2011. The Company believed that these utility license fees met the definition of privilege taxes within the Oregon statutes and that Gresham's increase violated the statutory 5% limitation on such taxes. PGE began collecting the incremental 2% tax from customers in Gresham, but filed suit against Gresham in Multnomah County Circuit Court, claiming that such an increase in privilege taxes violated Oregon law. In January, 2012, the Multnomah County Circuit Court ruled in favor of PGE, and the Company ceased collecting from Gresham customers the incremental 2% tax. Gresham appealed the Multnomah County Circuit Court decision to the Oregon Court of Appeals, which subsequently ruled in Gresham's favor. PGE appealed the Court of Appeals' ruling to the Oregon Supreme Court and on August 4, 2016, the Oregon Supreme Court issued its appellate judgment in favor of Gresham. As a result of this ruling, the Company was required to pay Gresham $0.8 million, which represented the amount it had already collected from customers, plus $7 million for the remaining accrued, but uncollected, amount of incremental taxes that were not paid to Gresham when due, covering the period from July 1, 2011 through September 1, 2016. PGE recorded a corresponding regulatory asset for the $7 million. On February 24, 2017, the Company made a filing requesting that the OPUC allow recovery of the $7 million from customers in Gresham over a five-year period. In November 2017, the OPUC ruled to allow such recovery, which is expected to begin in the first quarter of 2018. Other Regulatory Matters - The following discussion highlights certain regulatory items that have impacted the Company's revenues, results of operations, or cash flows for 2017 compared with 2016, or have affected retail customer prices, as authorized by the OPUC. In some cases, the Company has deferred the related expenses or benefits as regulatory assets or liabilities, respectively, for later amortization and inclusion in customer prices, pending OPUC review and authorization. Power Costs - Pursuant to the AUT process, PGE files annually an estimate of power costs for the following year. In the event a general rate case is filed in any given year, forecasted power costs would be included in such filing.  Such forecast assumes the following for the different types of PGE-owned generating resources: <U+25AA> Thermal - Expected operating conditions; <U+25AA> Hydroelectric - Regional hydro generation based on historical stream flow data and current hydro operating parameters; and  Wind - Generation levels based on a five-year historical rolling average of the wind farm. To the extent historical information is not available for a given year, the projections are based on wind generation studies. 41 Table of Contents For further information, see ""Power Operations"" in the Operating Activities section of this Overview, above. PGE's forecast of power costs for 2016 was approved by the OPUC with an expected reduction in annual revenues of $31 million. This amount was included in the expected net annual revenue requirement increase the OPUC authorized under the Company's 2016 GRC. Actual NVPC for 2016, as calculated for regulatory purposes under the PCAM, was $10 million below the 2016 baseline NVPC. As a result of the OCEP legislation described above, PGE's 2017 AUT filing included projected PTCs for the 2017 calendar year. Prior to this legislative change, PGE included forecasts of PTCs only in General Rate Case proceedings. The inclusion of PTCs in the AUT provides for annual forecast updates for these estimated tax credits, thus reducing the risk of regulatory lag in terms of adjusting customer prices. The 2017 AUT filing, approved by the OPUC in November 2016 and included in customer prices effective January 1, 2017, projected a reduction in power costs for 2017, and a corresponding reduction in annual revenue requirement, of $56 million from 2016 levels. Actual NVPC for 2017, as calculated for regulatory purposes under the PCAM, was $15 million above the 2017 baseline NVPC. As part of its 2018 GRC, PGE included an initial projected reduction in power costs of $29 million that was included in the overall request submitted to the OPUC. As approved by the OPUC in December 2017, the 2018 GRC included a final projected reduction in power costs for 2018 and a corresponding reduction in annual revenue requirement, of $40 million from 2017 levels. Renewable Resource Costs - Pursuant to the RAC mechanism, PGE can recover in customer prices prudently incurred costs of renewable resources that are expected to be placed in service in the current year. The Company may submit a filing to the OPUC by April 1 each year, with prices expected to become effective January 1 of the following year. As part of the RAC, the OPUC has authorized the deferral of eligible costs not yet included in customer prices until the January 1 effective date. No significant filings have been submitted under the RAC during 2017, 2016, or 2015. Decoupling Mechanism - The decoupling mechanism, which the OPUC has authorized through 2019, is intended to provide for recovery of margin lost as a result of a reduction in electricity sales attributable to energy efficiency, customer-owned generation, and conservation efforts by residential and certain commercial customers. The mechanism provides for collection from (or refund to) customers if weather-adjusted use per customer is less (or more) than that projected in the Company's most recent general rate case. The Company recorded an estimated collection of $13 million during the year ended December 31, 2017, which resulted from variances between actual weather-adjusted use per customer and that projected in the 2016 GRC. Collections under the decoupling mechanism are subject to an annual limitation, which for 2017 stood at $18 million. Any collection from customers for the 2017 year is expected to occur over a one-year period, which would begin January 1, 2019. The Company recorded an estimated collection of $3 million during the year ended December 31, 2016, as a result of variances from amounts established in the 2016 GRC. Collection for the year ended December 31, 2016 will occur over a one-year period, which began January 1, 2018. The $9 million refund recorded in 2015 that resulted from variances between actual weather adjusted use per customer and that projected in the 2015 GRC, occurred during 2017. Similarly, a refund of the $5 million recorded during 2014 occurred during 2016. Storm Restoration Costs - Beginning in 2011, the OPUC authorized the Company to collect $2 million annually from retail customers to cover incremental expenses related to major storm damages, and to defer 42 Table of Contents any amount not utilized in the current year. The 2018 GRC, as approved by the OPUC, increases the annual collection amount to $3 million, beginning in 2018. As a result of a series of storm events in the first half of 2017, the Company exhausted the $2 million storm collection authorized for 2017. Consequently, PGE was exposed to the incremental costs related to such major storms events, which totaled $11 million during 2017, less the amount collected in 2017. During 2015 and 2016, PGE fully used the reserve balance as a result of restoration costs associated with storm damage occurring during those years. As a result of the additional costs incurred, during the first quarter of 2017, PGE filed an application with the OPUC requesting authorization to defer incremental storm restoration costs from the date of the application through the end of 2017. Net of the $2 million being collected annually under the existing methodology, the application seeks deferral of $9 million. The Company is unable to predict how the OPUC will ultimately rule on this application. As a result, no deferral has been recorded as of December 31, 2017. Portland Harbor Environmental Remediation Account (PHERA) Mechanism - In July 2016, the Company filed an application with the OPUC seeking the deferral of the future environmental remediation costs, as well as seeking authorization to establish a regulatory cost recovery mechanism for such environmental costs. In the first quarter of 2017, the OPUC approved the recovery mechanism, which will allow the Company to defer and recover incurred environmental expenditures through a combination of third-party proceeds, such as insurance recoveries, and through customer prices, as necessary. The mechanism establishes annual prudency reviews of environmental expenditures and is subject to an annual earnings test. Deferral of 2018 Net Benefits Associated with the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act - On December 29, 2017, PGE filed with the OPUC an application to defer the 2017 and 2018 financial impacts resulting from the new tax law. If the deferral application is approved as requested, the refund of the net benefits associated with tax reform will be subject to an earnings test and limited by the Company's previously authorized regulated return on equity. For more information regarding the effects of the new tax law on the Company, see the ""Tax Reform"" of the Overview section of this Item 7. Results of Operations The following tables provide financial and operational information to be considered in conjunction with management's discussion and analysis of results of operations. PGE defines Gross margin as Revenues, net less Purchased power and fuel. Gross margin is considered a non-GAAP measure as it excludes depreciation and amortization and other operation and maintenance expenses. The presentation of Gross margin is intended to supplement an understanding of PGE's operating performance in relation to changes in customer prices, fuel costs, impacts of weather, customer counts and usage patterns, and impact from regulatory mechanisms such as decoupling. The Company's definition of Gross margin may be different from similar terms used by other companies and may not be comparable to their measures.

Industrial revenues from ESS customers were $20 million, $15 million, and $16 million for 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. (2) Includes both energy sold to retail customers and energy deliveries to those commercial and industrial customers that purchase their energy from ESSs. Commercial deliveries to ESS customers, in thousands of MWhs, were: 623 in 2017; 525 in 2016; and 509 in 2015. Industrial deliveries to ESS customers, in thousands of MWhs, were: 1,340 in 2017; 1,198 in 2016; and 1,177 in 2015. 45 Table of Contents PGE's sources of energy, total system load, and retail load requirement for the years presented are as follows: Years Ended December 31,   2017   2016   2015 Sources of energy (MWh in thousands):                       Generation:                       Thermal:                       Natural gas 6,228     28 %   5,811     27 %   4,783     22 % Coal 3,344     15     3,492     16     4,128     19   Total thermal 9,572     43     9,303     43     8,911     41   Hydro 1,774     8     1,629     8     1,453     7   Wind 1,641     8     1,912     9     1,788     8   Total generation 12,987     59     12,844     60     12,152     56   Purchased power:                       Term 7,192     33     6,961     32     7,364     35   Hydro 1,648     7     1,541     7     1,572     7   Wind 264     1     301     1     303     2   Total purchased power 9,104     41     8,803     40     9,239     44   Total system load 22,091     100 %   21,647     100 %   21,391     100 % Less: wholesale sales (3,193 )       (3,352 )       (2,560 )     Retail load requirement 18,898         18,295         18,831 Net income for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $187 million, or $2.10 per diluted share, compared with $193 million, or $2.16 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2016. The $6 million, or 3%, decrease in net income resulted primarily from the net impact of the following three items: i) Gross margin increased due to higher energy demand, primarily due to weather and strength in the industrial sector; ii) Operating expense increased due to higher depreciation expense as a result of asset base growth, several storms in 2017 that increased restoration expenses, higher administrative and general expenses due to increases in employee count, and additional litigation and interest expense related to Carty; and iii) Income tax expense increased due to higher pre-tax income, the impacts of the TCJA, and lower PTCs. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $193 million, or $2.16 per diluted share, compared with $172 million, or $2.04 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2015. The $21 million, or 12%, increase resulted in part from lower net variable power costs than what was reflected in revenues in the Company's 2016 AUT. Purchased power and fuel costs decreased as the region experienced better hydro conditions in 2016 than in 2015, as well as improved wind generation, which also produced more PTCs. Average variable power cost per MWh declined 8% from 2015 and a 31% increase in the volume of wholesale energy sales also helped to reduce net variable power costs. Retail revenues increased only slightly as continued expansion in the average number of customers served and price changes authorized in the 2016 GRC were largely offset by the influences of weather and energy efficiency measures. Incremental depreciation expense related to the higher than planned construction cost of Carty, which were not covered in customer prices, as well as legal expenses related to litigation associated with the termination of the Carty Construction Agreement, along with higher storm and service restoration costs in 2016 somewhat countered the other improvements in net income. 46 Table of Contents 2017 Compared to 2016 Revenues increased $86 million, or 4.5%, in 2017 compared with 2016 as a result of the items discussed below. Total retail revenues increased $77 million, or 4.3%, in 2017 compared with 2016, primarily due to the net effect of:  A $71 million increase due to a 3.9% increase in retail energy deliveries consisting of a 7.2% increase in residential deliveries, a 2.8% increase in industrial deliveries, and a 1.3% increase in commercial deliveries. Considerably cooler temperatures in the first half of 2017 than experienced in 2016 combined with warmer temperatures in the summer cooling season in 2017, both drove deliveries higher in 2017 than in 2016. For further information on customer demand, see ""Customers and Demand"" in the Overview section of this Item 7;  A $10 million increase resulting from the Decoupling mechanism, as an estimated $13 million collection was recorded in 2017; and  A $5 million increase, directly offset in Depreciation and amortization expense, related to the accelerated cost recovery of Colstrip, partially offset by  A $5 million reduction as a result of overall price changes, which includes a $55 million reduction in revenues attributable to lower NVPC, as filed in the 2017 AUT; and  A $3 million decrease due to higher customer credits related to the USDOE settlement in connection with operation of the ISFSI at the former Trojan nuclear power plant site. Such credits are directly offset in Depreciation and amortization expense. Total heating degree-days in 2017 were above the 15-year average and considerably greater than total heating degree-days in 2016. Total cooling degree-days in 2017 exceeded the 15-year average by 49% and were considerably higher than 2016. The following table presents the number of heating and cooling degree-days in 2017 and 2016, along with the 15-year averages, reflecting that weather had a considerable influence on comparative energy deliveries: Heating Degree-Days   Cooling Degree-Days      2017   2016   15-Year Average   2017   2016   15-Year Average 1st quarter 2,171     1,585     1,867      -       -       -    2nd quarter 686     403     689     129     154     70   3rd quarter 78     78     78     571     394     399   4th quarter 1,623     1,486     1,599      -       -      2   Total 4,558     3,552     4,233     700     548     471   Increase (decrease) from the 15-year average 8 %   (16 )%       49 %   16 % On a weather-adjusted basis, total retail energy deliveries in 2017 were 0.6% below 2016 levels. PGE projects that retail energy deliveries for 2018 will be nearly comparable to slightly lower than 2017 weather-adjusted levels, reflecting the closure of a large paper customer in late 2017 as well as continued energy efficiency and conservation efforts. Wholesale revenues result from sales of electricity to utilities and power marketers made in the Company's efforts to secure reasonably priced power for its retail customers, manage risk, and administer its current long-term wholesale contracts. Such sales can vary significantly from year to year as a result of economic conditions, power and fuel prices, hydro and wind availability, and customer demand. In 2017, the $2 million, or 2%, increase in wholesale revenues from 2016 consisted of a $7 million increase that resulted as a 7% increase in average prices was received when the Company sold power into the wholesale market, partially offset by a $5 million decrease related to 5% less wholesale sales volume. 47 Table of Contents Other operating revenues increased $7 million, or 19%, in 2017 from 2016, as the sale of excess natural gas not used to fuel the Company's generating facilities accounted for the majority of the increase. Purchased power and fuel expense includes the cost of power purchased and fuel used to generate electricity to meet PGE's retail load requirements, as well as the cost of settled electric and natural gas financial contracts. In 2017, Purchased power and fuel expense decreased $25 million, or 4%, from 2016, which was driven by a $38 million, or 6%, decline related to the decrease in the average variable power cost per MWh to $26.80 in 2017 from $28.50 in 2016, partially offset by a $13 million increase resulting from a 2% increase in total system load. The decrease related to average variable power cost per MWh was driven primarily by: i) a 7% reduction in the average variable power cost per MWh for purchased power as the Company, on average, purchased power at lower market prices; and ii) a 13% reduction in the average variable power cost per MWh related to energy received from the Company's natural gas-fired resources due to lower natural gas prices. This was partially offset by the purchase of replacement power due to 14% less energy received from the Company's wind generating resources. The net increase in total system load was driven primarily by higher customer demand as a result of the impacts of weather. Energy obtained from the Company's natural gas-fired resources increased 7% due largely to Carty being in service the full year and energy obtained from the Company's hydro resources increased 9% due to more favorable hydro conditions. Energy obtained from purchased power increased 3% in response to higher system load, as well as the purchase of replacement energy due to a reduction in energy received from the Company's wind generating resources. In 2017, energy received from Biglow Canyon and Tucannon River decreased 14% from 2016 due to less favorable wind conditions, and provided 9% of the Company's retail load requirement in 2017 compared with 10% in 2016. As a result of improved hydro conditions in the region for 2017, energy received from PGE-owned hydroelectric projects in combination with mid-Columbia projects was 8% above 2016 levels, and represented 18% of the Company's retail load requirement for 2017 compared with 17% for 2016. The following table presents the actual April-to-September 2017 and 2016 runoff at particular points of major rivers relevant to PGE's hydro resources:   Runoff as a Percent of 30-year Average Location 2017 Actual   2016 Actual Columbia River at The Dalles, Oregon 98 %   89 % Mid-Columbia River at Grand Coulee, Washington 98     91   Clackamas River at Estacada, Oregon 97     71   Deschutes River at Moody, Oregon 98     91 Actual NVPC, which consists of Purchased power and fuel expense net of Wholesale revenues, decreased $27 million in 2017 compared with 2016. The decrease attributable to changes in Purchased power and fuel expense was the result of a 6% decline in the average variable power cost per MWh, offset slightly by a 2% increase in total 48 Table of Contents system load. The decrease in actual NVPC was also driven by a 7% increase in the average price per MWh of wholesale power sales, offset slightly by a 5% decrease in the volume of wholesale energy deliveries as a greater portion of its system load was used to meet retail load requirements, largely due to the effects of weather. For 2017, actual NVPC, as calculated for regulatory purposes under the PCAM, was $15 million above the 2017 baseline NVPC. In 2016, NVPC was $10 million below the anticipated baseline. For further information regarding NVPC, see ""Power Operations"" in the Overview section of this Item 7. Generation, transmission, and distribution expense increased $23 million, or 8%, in 2017 compared with 2016. The increase was driven by the combination of $10 million in higher costs due to the addition of Carty, $8 million higher service restoration and storm costs, $3 million higher plant maintenance expenses, and $2 million higher information technology expenses. Administrative and other expense increased $17 million, or 7%, in 2017 compared with 2016, primarily due to $12 million higher overall labor and employee benefit expenses and $3 million higher legal costs attributable to Carty. Depreciation and amortization expense in 2017 increased $24 million, or 7%, compared with 2016. The increase was primarily driven by $26 million higher expense resulting from capital additions, offset by a $3 million reduction in expense due to higher amortization credits in 2017 of the regulatory liability for the ISFSI spent fuel settlement. The overall impact resulting from the amortization of the regulatory assets and liabilities is directly offset by corresponding reductions in retail revenues. Taxes other than income taxes expense increased $4 million, or 3%, in 2017 compared with 2016, driven by $2 million higher Oregon property taxes and $2 million higher payroll taxes. Interest expense increased $8 million, or 7%, in 2017 compared with 2016 due to a $4 million decrease in the credits for the allowance for borrowed funds used during construction (primarily due to the Carty plant being placed in service in 2016) and increased expense of $3 million resulting from a 5% increase in the average balance of debt outstanding. Other income, net was $17 million in 2017 compared to $22 million in 2016, with the decrease primarily due to lower allowance for equity funds used during construction, which resulted from Carty being placed in service during 2016. Income tax expense increased $36 million, or 72%, in 2017 compared to 2016. The change relates to a $13 million increase due to higher pre-tax income and $7 million due to lower production tax credits. Additionally, Income tax expense increased $17 million due to the remeasurement of deferred taxes pursuant to the change in corporate tax rates in the TCJA. For more information regarding the Company's proposed deferral application, see the ""Legal, Regulatory, and Environmental Matters"" Section of this Item 7. 2016 Compared to 2015 Revenues increased $25 million, or 1.3%, in 2016 compared with 2015 as a result of the items discussed below. Total retail revenues increased $8 million, or 0.5%, in 2016 compared with 2015, primarily due to the net effect of:  A $49 million increase resulting from price changes, as authorized by the OPUC, including Carty going into service and into customer prices in mid-2016, as a result of the Company's 2016 GRC;  A $10 million increase resulting from the Decoupling mechanism, as an estimated $3 million collection was recorded in 2016 compared to a refund in 2015;  A $5 million increase due to a lower amount of customer credits related to tax credits in connection with operation of the ISFSI at the former Trojan nuclear power plant site. Such credits are directly offset in depreciation and amortization expense; and  A $5 million overall increase due to various other largely offsetting tariff changes and adjustments; partially offset by  A $38 million decrease in revenues related to a 2.1% decrease in retail energy deliveries, consisting of 8.4% and 0.7% decreases in industrial and commercial deliveries, respectively, partially offset by a 0.3% increase in residential deliveries. See ""Customers and Demand"" in the Overview section of this Item 7. for further information on customer demand; and  A $23 million decrease related to the collection from customers during 2015 of costs associated with previous capital project deferrals, with no comparable collection in 2016. This decrease in revenues is largely offset by a comparable decrease in depreciation and amortization expense. Total heating degree-days in 2016 were lower than the 15-year average although somewhat greater than total heating degree-days in 2015. Total cooling degree-days in 2016 exceeded the 15-year average although were considerably less than the 2015 total. The following table presents the number of heating and cooling degree-days in 2016 and 2015, along with the 15-year averages: 49 Table of Contents Heating Degree-Days   Cooling Degree-Days   2016   2015   15-Year Average   2016   2015   15-Year Average 1st quarter 1,585     1,481     1,866      -       -       -    2nd quarter 403     513     689     154     207     70   3rd quarter 78     76     78     394     573     399   4th quarter 1,486     1,391     1,600      -      5     2   Total 3,552     3,461     4,233     548     785     471   Increase (decrease) from the 15-year average (16 )%   (18 )%         16 %   67 % On a weather-adjusted basis, retail energy deliveries in 2016 were 1.4% below 2015 although one large paper customer ceased operations in late 2015. On a comparable year over year basis, with the removal of the one large paper customer load from the 2015 year, the Company experienced weather-adjusted load growth of 0.9%. Wholesale revenues in 2016 increased $15 million, or 17%, from 2015, with such increase consisting of $27 million related to 31% greater wholesale sales volume partially offset by a $12 million decrease related to 11% lower average wholesale market prices. Other operating revenues increased $2 million, or 6%, in 2016 from 2015, primarily due to a $2 million increase in resale of unneeded natural gas in combination with several smaller, rather offsetting items including revenues from broadband fiber deployment and steam sales. Purchased power and fuel expense in 2016 decreased $44 million, or 7%, from 2015, driven by a $51 million, or 8%, decline related to the decrease in the average variable power cost per MWh to $28.50 in 2016 from $30.91 in 2015, partially offset by a $7 million increase resulting from a 1% increase in total system load. The decrease related to average variable power cost per MWh was driven primarily by a reduction in purchased power prices. The net increase in total system load was comprised of a $38 million, or 22%, increase due to energy generated from the Company's natural gas-fired resources, offset by the combination of a $13 million, or 15%, decrease in energy generated from Company-owned coal-fired resources and an $18 million, or 5%, reduction in energy received from purchased power. The increase in natural gas-fired generation was due primarily to the replacement of energy received from higher cost resources and reflects the addition of Carty in July 2016. In 2016, energy received from Biglow Canyon and Tucannon River increased 7% from 2015 due to more favorable wind conditions, and represented 10% of the Company's retail load requirement in 2016 compared with 9% in 2015. As a result of improved hydro conditions in the region, energy received from PGE-owned hydroelectric projects and from mid-Columbia projects combined for 2016 was 5% above 2015 levels, and represented 17% of the Company's retail load requirement for 2016 and 16% for 2015. The following table presents the actual of the April-to-September runoff for 2016 and 2015:  Runoff as a Percent of 30-year Average Location 2016 Actual   2015 Actual Columbia River at The Dalles, Oregon 89 %   69 % Mid-Columbia River at Grand Coulee, Washington 91     77   Clackamas River at Estacada, Oregon 71     53   Deschutes River at Moody, Oregon 91     85 Actual NVPC decreased $59 million for 2016 compared with 2015. The decrease attributable to changes in Purchased power and fuel expense was the result of an 8% decline in the average variable power cost per MWh, offset slightly by a 1% increase in total system load. The decrease in actual NVPC was also driven by a 31% increase in the volume of wholesale energy deliveries as the Company's retail load requirement decreased in 2016, largely due to the effects of weather, which resulted in a greater portion of its system load being sold into the wholesale market. The increase was partially offset by an 11% decrease in the average price per MWh of wholesale power sales. The 2016 GRC had anticipated a decrease of approximately $31 million in NVPC from the 2015 baseline, with customer prices set accordingly. For 2016, actual NVPC, as calculated for regulatory purposes under the PCAM, was $10 million below the 2016 baseline NVPC, compared with $3 million below for 2015. Generation, transmission, and distribution expense increased $20 million, or 8%, in 2016 compared with 2015.  The increase was driven by the combination of $7 million in higher costs due to the addition of Carty, $5 million higher service restoration and storm costs, $4 million higher information technology expenses, $4 million higher inspection and testing costs for the distribution system, $2 million higher plant maintenance expenses, and $2 million higher labor expense. Partially offsetting the increases was a reduction in expenses of $6 million due to the repair and maintenance work during the annual planned outage and economic displacement of Boardman in 2015. Administrative and other expense increased $6 million, or 2%, in 2016 compared with 2015, primarily due to $5 million higher legal costs attributable to Carty. The Company experienced slightly higher overall labor and employee benefit expenses although a $3 million reduction in pension expenses and a $2 million reduction in injuries and damages expense offset a large portion of those increases. Depreciation and amortization expense in 2016 increased $16 million, or 5%, compared with 2015. The increase was primarily driven by $20 million higher expense resulting from capital additions, a $7 million expense increase resulting from the amortization credits in 2015 from gains recorded on the sale of assets, and a $5 million expense increase from lower amortization credits in 2016 of the regulatory liability for the ISFSI tax credits, offset by a $19 million expense decrease that resulted from the completion at the end of 2015 of the amortization of the regulatory asset related to the four capital projects deferral as authorized in the Company's 2011 GRC. The overall impact resulting from the amortization of the regulatory assets and liabilities is directly offset by corresponding reductions in retail revenues. Taxes other than income taxes expense increased $3 million, or 3%, in 2016 compared with 2015, as higher property valuations in the State of Oregon increased taxes by $4 million, which was partially offset by lower property tax rates in both Oregon and Washington. Interest expense decreased $2 million, or 2%, in 2016 compared with 2015 as $4 million lower expense resulted from a 3% decrease in the average balance of debt outstanding, partially offset by $2 million less allowance for borrowed funds used during construction credits. 50 Table of Contents Other income, net was $22 million in both 2016 and 2015 and was comprised primarily of $21 million in the allowance for equity funds used during construction each year, driven by the construction of Carty. Income tax expense increased $5 million, or 11%, in 2016 compared with 2015. Higher pre-tax income accounted for a $10 million increase, which was partially offset by a $3 million increase in production tax credits and a combination of state credits and tax deductions that reduced expense by $2 million. Liquidity and Capital Resources Discussions, forward-looking statements, and projections in this section, and similar statements in other parts of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, are subject to PGE's assumptions regarding the availability and cost of capital. See ""Capital and credit market conditions could adversely affect the Company's access to capital, cost of capital, and ability to execute its strategic plan as currently envisioned."" in Item 1A. - Risk Factors, for further information. Capital Requirements The following table presents actual capital expenditures and debt maturities for 2017 and projected capital expenditures and future debt maturities for 2018 through 2022 (in millions, excluding AFDC): Years Ending December 31,   2017   2018   2019   2020   2021   2022 Ongoing capital expenditures(1) $ 462     $ 535     $ 444     $ 451     $ 440     $ 450   Customer information system(2) 49     16      -       -       -       -    Total capital expenditures $ 511   (3) $ 551     $ 444     $ 451     $ 440     $ 450                           Long-term debt maturities $ 150     $  -      $ 300     $  -      $ 160     $  - (1) Consists primarily of upgrades to, and replacement of, generation, transmission, and distribution infrastructure, as well as new customer connects. (2) Total capital expenditures for the customer information system through December 31, 2017 were $114 million, excluding AFDC. (3) Includes preliminary engineering and removal costs, which are included in other net operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows. For a discussion concerning PGE's ability to fund its future capital requirements, see ""Debt and Equity Financings"" in this Item 7. Liquidity PGE's access to short-term debt markets, including revolving credit from banks, helps provide necessary liquidity to support the Company's current operating activities, including the purchase of power and fuel. Long-term capital requirements are driven largely by capital expenditures for distribution, transmission, and generation facilities to support both new and existing customers, information technology systems, and debt refinancing activities. PGE's liquidity and capital requirements can also be significantly affected by other working capital needs, including margin deposit requirements related to wholesale market activities, which can vary depending upon the Company's forward positions and the corresponding price curves. 51 Table of Contents The following summarizes PGE's cash flows for the periods presented (in millions): Years Ended December 31,   2017   2016   2015 Cash and cash equivalents, beginning of year $ 6     $ 4     $ 127   Net cash provided by (used in):           Operating activities 597     553     520   Investing activities (514 )   (585 )   (522 ) Financing activities (50 )   34     (121 ) Net change in cash and cash equivalents 33     2     (123 ) Cash and cash equivalents, end of year $ 39     $ 6     $ 4 2017 Compared to 2016 Cash Flows from Operating Activities - Cash flows from operating activities are generally determined by the amount and timing of cash received from customers and payments made to vendors, as well as the nature and amount of non-cash items, including depreciation and amortization, deferred income taxes, and pension and other postretirement benefit costs included in net income during a given period. The $44 million increase in cash flows from operating activities in 2017 compared to 2016 reflects that while Net income was nearly comparable, adjustments to Net income to reconcile to net cash provided included increases of $33 million for Deferred income taxes ($17 million of which related to Tax reform), $22 million for Other non-cash income and expenses, and $24 million for Depreciation and amortization expense. Somewhat offsetting those increases were decreases of $28 million from Margin deposits outstanding due to changes in prices of power and fuel underlying contracts with counterparties and $16 million as a result of the Decoupling mechanism, which reflects both the current year deferral and the refund to customers related to prior years. Cash provided by operations includes the recovery in customer prices of non-cash charges for depreciation and amortization. The Company estimates that such charges in 2018 will range from $370 million to $380 million. Combined with all other sources, cash provided by operations in 2018 is estimated to range from $575 million to $625 million. As a result of the tax law changes made under the TCJA, PGE's operating cash flows are generally expected to decrease in the future as customer prices will reflect lower income tax expense recoveries going forward, as well as refunds of the net benefits of changes in tax law under the TCJA, offset partially by the impacts of higher rate base over time. PGE expects that customer prices will be adjusted for the impacts of the TCJA as a part of the Company's 2019 GRC. Currently, the Company does not believe this decrease in future operating cash flows will have a material impact on its future liquidity or credit ratings. For more information regarding the effects of the new tax law on the Company, see the ""Tax Reform"" of the Overview section of this Item 7. Cash Flows from Investing Activities - Cash flows used in investing activities consist primarily of capital expenditures related to new construction and improvements to PGE's distribution, transmission, and generation facilities. The $71 million decrease in net cash used in investing activities in 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily due to a decrease in Capital expenditures as Carty was placed into service in July 2016. The Company plans for approximately $551 million of capital expenditures in 2018 related to upgrades to and replacement of generation, transmission, and distribution infrastructure. PGE plans to fund the 2018 capital expenditures with cash from operations during 2018, as discussed above, as well as with the issuance of short- and long-term debt securities. For additional information, see ""Capital Requirements"" and ""Debt and Equity Financings"" in the Liquidity and Capital Resources section of this Item 7. Cash Flows from Financing Activities - Financing activities provide supplemental cash for both day-to-day operations and capital requirements as needed. During 2017, cash used in financing activities consisted primarily of 52 Table of Contents the issuance of $225 million of long-term debt, less the repayment $150 million of term loans and payment of dividends in the amount of $118 million. During 2016, cash provided by financing activities consisted of the issuance of $290 million of long-term debt less the repayment of $133 million of FMBs and the payment of dividends of $110 million. 53 Table of Contents 2016 Compared to 2015 Cash Flows from Operating Activities - The $33 million increase in cash flows from operating activities in 2016 compared to 2015 was largely due to increases in net income and depreciation expense, partly offset by the impact of changes in other non-cash income and expense items including amounts recorded under the decoupling mechanism, and a decrease in margin deposits. The remaining non-cash income and expenses and other components of working capital were fairly consistent year over year. Cash Flows from Investing Activities - The $63 million increase in net cash used in investing activities in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily due to a distribution of $50 million from the Nuclear decommissioning trust and $23 million the Company received from a sales tax refund related to Tucannon River, both in 2015. Capital expenditures decreased $14 million as Carty was placed into service in July 2016. For additional information regarding the distribution from the Nuclear decommissioning trust, see Note 3, Balance Sheet Components, and Note 7, Asset Retirement Obligations, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. - ""Financial Statements and Supplementary Data."" Cash Flows from Financing Activities - During 2016, cash provided by financing activities consisted of the issuance of $290 million of long-term debt less the repayment $133 million of FMBs and dividends of $110 million. During 2015, cash used in financing activities consisted of repayments of long-term debt of $442 million and the payment of dividends of $97 million. Dividends on Common Stock The following table presents common stock dividends declared in 2017: Declaration Date    Record Date    Payment Date    Declared Per Common Share February 15, 2017   March 27, 2017   April 17, 2017   $ 0.32   April 26, 2017   June 26, 2017   July 17, 2017   0.34   July 26, 2017   September 25, 2017   October 16, 2017   0.34   October 25, 2017   December 26, 2017   January 16, 2018   0.34 While the Company expects to pay regular quarterly dividends on its common stock, the declaration of any dividends is at the discretion of the Company's Board of Directors. On February 14, 2018, a common stock dividend of $0.34 per share was declared, payable April 16, 2018 to shareholders of record on March 26, 2018. The amount of any dividend declaration will depend upon factors that the Board of Directors deems relevant and may include, but are not limited to, PGE's results of operations and financial condition, future capital expenditures and investments, and applicable regulatory and contractual restrictions. 54 Table of Contents Credit Ratings and Debt Covenants PGE's secured and unsecured debt is rated investment grade by Moody's and S&P, with current credit ratings and outlook as follows: Moody's    S&P First Mortgage Bonds A1   A- Senior unsecured debt A3   BBB Commercial paper P-2   A-2 Outlook Stable   Positive Should Moody's and/or S&P reduce their credit rating on PGE's unsecured debt below investment grade, the Company could be subject to requests by certain of its wholesale, commodity, and transmission counterparties to post additional performance assurance collateral in connection with its price risk management activities. The performance assurance collateral can be in the form of cash deposits or letters of credit, depending on the terms of the underlying agreements, and are based on the contract terms and commodity prices and can vary from period to period. Cash deposits provided as collateral are classified as Margin deposits in PGE's consolidated balance sheet, while any letters of credit issued are not reflected in the Company's consolidated balance sheet. As of December 31, 2017, PGE had posted $42 million of collateral with these counterparties, consisting of $11 million in cash and $31 million in bank letters of credit, $11 million of which is related to master netting agreements. Based on the Company's energy portfolio, estimates of energy market prices, and the level of collateral outstanding as of December 31, 2017, the amount of additional collateral that could be requested upon a single agency downgrade to below investment grade is $84 million and decreases to $14 million by December 31, 2018 and $5 million by December 31, 2019. The amount of additional collateral that could be requested upon a dual agency downgrade to below investment grade is $175 million and decreases to $88 million by December 31, 2018 and $64 million by December 31, 2019. PGE's financing arrangements do not contain ratings triggers that would result in the acceleration of required interest and principal payments in the event of a ratings downgrade. However, the cost of borrowing and issuing letters of credit under the credit facilities would increase. The Indenture securing PGE's outstanding FMBs constitutes a direct first mortgage lien on substantially all regulated utility property, other than expressly excepted property. Interest is payable semi-annually on FMBs. The issuance of FMBs requires that PGE meet earnings coverage and security provisions set forth in the Indenture of Mortgage and Deed of Trust securing the bonds. PGE estimates that on December 31, 2017, under the most restrictive issuance test in the Indenture of Mortgage and Deed of Trust, the Company could have issued up to $1.1 billion of additional FMBs. Any issuances of FMBs would be subject to market conditions and amounts could be further limited by regulatory authorizations or by covenants and tests contained in other financing agreements. PGE also has the ability to release property from the lien of the Indenture of Mortgage and Deed of Trust under certain circumstances, including bond credits, deposits of cash, or certain sales, exchanges, or other dispositions of property. PGE's credit facilities contain customary covenants and credit provisions, including a requirement that limits consolidated indebtedness, as defined in the credit agreements, to 65% of total capitalization (debt to total capital ratio). As of December 31, 2017, the Company's debt to total capital ratio, as calculated under the credit agreements, was 51.8%. Debt and Equity Financings PGE's ability to secure sufficient long-term capital at a reasonable cost is determined by its financial performance and outlook, its credit ratings, its capital expenditure requirements, alternatives available to investors, market conditions, and other factors. Management believes that the availability of revolving credit facilities, the expected 55 Table of Contents ability to issue long-term debt and equity securities, and cash expected to be generated from operations provide sufficient cash flow and liquidity to meet the Company's anticipated capital and operating requirements for the foreseeable future. For 2018, PGE expects to fund estimated capital requirements with cash from operations, the issuance of debt securities of up to $100 million, and the issuance of commercial paper, as needed. The actual timing and amount of any such issuances of debt or commercial paper will be dependent upon the timing and amount of capital expenditures. Short-term Debt - PGE has approval from the FERC to issue short-term debt up to a total of $900 million through February 6, 2020. As of December 31, 2017, PGE had a $500 million revolving credit facility scheduled to expire in November 2021. The revolving credit facility supplements operating cash flows and provides a primary source of liquidity. Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, the revolving credit facility may be used as backup for commercial paper borrowings, to permit the issuance of standby letters of credit, and for general corporate purposes. PGE may borrow for one, two, three, or six months at a fixed interest rate established at the time of the borrowing, or at a variable interest rate for any period up to the then remaining term of the applicable credit facility. The Company has a commercial paper program under which it may issue commercial paper for terms of up to 270 days, limited to the unused amount of credit under the revolving credit facility. PGE classifies any borrowings under the revolving credit facility and outstanding commercial paper as Short-term debt in the consolidated balance sheets. Under the revolving credit facility, as of December 31, 2017, PGE had no borrowings outstanding, and no commercial paper or letters of credit issued. As a result, as of December 31, 2017, the aggregate unused available credit capacity under the revolving credit facility was $500 million. In addition, PGE has four letter of credit facilities under which the Company can request letters of credit for original terms not to exceed one year. These facilities provide for a total capacity of $220 million. The issuance of such letters of credit is subject to the approval of the issuing institution. Under these facilities, letters of credit for a total of $67 million were outstanding as of December 31, 2017. Long-term Debt - During 2017, PGE issued a total of $225 million of FMBs at an interest rate of 3.98%. PGE drew $75 million in August 2017 with a maturity date of 2048 and drew the remaining $150 million in November 2017 with a maturity of 2047. In 2017, PGE repaid three separate term loans drawn on an unsecured credit agreement under which it had borrowed $150 million from certain financial institutions. PGE repaid the loan as follows:  $50 million on August 21, 2017;  $25 million on October 30, 2017; and  $75 million on November 27, 2017. As of December 31, 2017, total long-term debt outstanding, net of $10 million unamortized debt expense, was $2,426 million, of which none is scheduled to mature in 2018. Capital Structure - PGE's financial objectives include maintaining a common equity ratio (common equity to total consolidated capitalization, including current debt maturities) of approximately 50% over time. Achievement of this objective helps the Company maintain investment grade debt ratings and provides access to long-term capital at favorable interest rates. The Company's common equity ratio was 49.4% as of December 31, 2017 and 2016. 56 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments The following table presents PGE's contractual obligations as of December 31, 2017 (in millions): 2018   2019   2020   2021   2022   There- after   Total Long-term debt $  -      $ 300     $  -      $ 160     $  -      $ 1,976     $ 2,436   Interest on long-term debt (1) 123     110     104     100     99     1,574     2,110   Capital and other purchase commitments 191     2     10     2     2     58     265   Purchased power and fuel:                           Electricity purchases 156     156     201     200     187     1,733     2,633   Capacity contracts 6     5     4     4     4     8     31   Public Utility Districts 9     17     16     16     15     85     158   Natural gas 51     35     28     25     24     140     303   Coal and transportation 15     5      -       -       -       -      20   Pension Plan Contributions (2) 21     17     17     18     24      -      97   Capital leases 7     6     6     6     5     72     102   Build-to-suit lease  -      15     15     14     14     260     318   Operating leases 9     8     6     6     8     165     202   Total $ 588     $ 676     $ 407     $ 551     $ 382     $ 6,071     $ 8,675 (1) Future interest on long-term debt is calculated based on the assumption that all debt remains outstanding until maturity. For debt instruments with variable rates, interest is calculated for all future periods using the rates in effect as of December 31, 2017. (2) Contributions beyond 2022 are not estimated due to significant uncertainty in financial market and demographic outcomes. Other Financial Obligations PGE has entered into long-term power purchase agreements with certain public utility districts in the state of Washington under which it has acquired a percentage of the output of the Priest Rapids, Wanapum, and Wells hydroelectric projects. The Company is required to pay its proportionate share of the operating and debt service costs of the projects whether or not they are operable. The agreements further provide that, should any other purchaser of output default on payments as a result of bankruptcy or insolvency, PGE would be allocated a pro rata share of both the output and the operating and debt service costs of the defaulting purchaser. For the Wells project, PGE would be allocated up to a cumulative maximum of 25% of the defaulting purchaser's percentage of the output through August 2018, after which PGE would be responsible for a pro-rata portion of the defaulting purchaser's share with no limitation, regardless of the reason for any default. For the Priest Rapids and Wanapum projects, PGE would be allocated up to a cumulative maximum that would not adversely affect the tax exempt status of any of the public utility district's outstanding debt for the portion of the project that benefits tax exempt purchasers. For additional information on these long-term power purchase agreements, see ""Public utility districts"" in Note 15, Commitments and Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. - ""Financial Statements and Supplementary Data."" Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements PGE has no off-balance sheet arrangements other than outstanding letters of credit from time to time that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a material current or future effect on its consolidated financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources. 57 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires that management apply accounting policies and make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the statements. The following accounting policies represent those that management believes are particularly important to the consolidated financial statements and that require the use of estimates, assumptions, and judgments to determine matters that are inherently uncertain. Regulatory Accounting As a rate-regulated enterprise, PGE applies regulatory accounting, which includes the recognition of regulatory assets and liabilities on the Company's consolidated balance sheets. Regulatory assets represent probable future revenue associated with certain incurred costs that are expected to be recovered from customers through the ratemaking process. Regulatory liabilities represent probable future reductions in revenues associated with amounts that are expected to be credited or refunded to customers through the ratemaking process. Regulatory accounting is appropriate as long as prices are established or subject to approval by independent third-party regulators, prices are designed to recover the specific enterprise's cost of service, and, in view of demand for service, it is reasonable to assume that prices set at levels that will recover costs can be charged to and collected from customers. Amortization of regulatory assets and liabilities is reflected in the statement of income over the period in which they are included in customer prices. If future recovery of regulatory assets is not probable, PGE would expense such items in the period such determination is made. Further, if PGE determines that all or a portion of its utility operations no longer meet the criteria for continued application of regulatory accounting, the Company would be required to write off those regulatory assets and liabilities related to operations that no longer meet requirements for regulatory accounting. Discontinued application of regulatory accounting would have a material impact on the Company's results of operations and financial position. Asset Retirement Obligations PGE recognizes AROs for legal obligations related to dismantlement and restoration costs associated with the future retirement of tangible long-lived assets. Upon initial recognition of AROs that are measurable, the probability-weighted future cash flows for the associated retirement costs, discounted using a credit-adjusted risk-free rate, are recognized as both a liability and as an increase in the capitalized carrying amount of the related long-lived assets. Due to the long lead time involved, a market-risk premium cannot be determined for inclusion in future cash flows. In estimating the liability, management must utilize significant judgment and assumptions in determining whether a legal obligation exists to remove assets. Other estimates may be related to lease provisions, ownership agreements, licensing issues, cost estimates, inflation, and certain legal requirements. Changes that may arise over time with regard to these assumptions and determinations can change future amounts recorded for AROs. Capitalized asset retirement costs related to electric utility plant are depreciated over the estimated life of the related asset and included in Depreciation and amortization expense in the consolidated statements of income. Accretion of the ARO liability is classified as an operating expense in the consolidated statements of income. Accumulated asset retirement removal costs that do not qualify as AROs have been reclassified from accumulated depreciation to regulatory liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. Revenue Recognition Retail customers are billed monthly for electricity use based on meter readings taken throughout the month. At the end of each month, PGE estimates the revenue earned from the last meter read date through the last day of the month, which has not yet been billed to customers. Such amount, which is classified as Unbilled revenues in the Company's consolidated balance sheets, is calculated based on each month's actual net retail system load, the number of days from the last meter read date through the last day of the month, and current customer prices. 58 Table of Contents Contingencies PGE has various unresolved legal and regulatory matters about which there is inherent uncertainty, with the ultimate outcome contingent upon several factors. Such contingencies are evaluated using the best information available. A loss contingency is accrued, and disclosed if material, when it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. If a range of probable loss is established, the minimum amount in the range is accrued, unless some other amount within the range appears to be a better estimate. If the probable loss cannot be reasonably estimated, no accrual is recorded, but the loss contingency and the reasons to the effect that it cannot be reasonably estimated are disclosed. Material loss contingencies are disclosed when it is reasonably possible that an asset has been impaired or a liability incurred. Established accruals reflect management's assessment of inherent risks, credit worthiness, and complexities involved in the process. There can be no assurance as to the ultimate outcome of any particular contingency. Pension Plan Primary assumptions used in the actuarial valuation of PGE's pension plan include the discount rate, the expected return on plan assets, mortality rates, and wage escalation. These assumptions are evaluated by the Company, reviewed annually with the plan actuaries and trust investment consultants, and updated in light of market changes, trends, and future expectations. Significant differences between assumptions and actual experience can have a material impact on the valuation of the pension benefit plan obligation and net periodic pension cost. PGE's pension discount rate is determined based on a portfolio of high-quality bonds that match the duration of the plan cash flows. The expected rate of return on plan assets is based on the projected long-term return on assets in the plan investment portfolio. PGE capitalizes a portion of pension expense based on the proportion of labor costs capitalized. Changes in actuarial assumptions can also have a material effect on net periodic pension expense. A 0.25% reduction in the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, or reduction in the discount rate, would have the effect of increasing the 2017 net periodic pension expense by approximately $2 million. Fair Value Measurements PGE applies fair value measurements to its financial assets and liabilities, with fair value defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The Company's financial assets and liabilities consist of: i) derivative instruments entered into in connection with its price risk management activities; ii) the majority of assets held by the Nuclear decommissioning trust, the Pension plan, and the Non-qualified benefit plan trust; and iii) long-term debt. In valuing these items, the Company uses inputs and assumptions that market participants would use to determine their fair value, utilizing valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. The determination of fair value can require subjective and complex judgment and PGE's assessment of the inputs and the significance of a particular input to fair value measurement may affect the valuation of the instruments and their placement within the fair value hierarchy reported in its financial statements.","ITEM 7A.     QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. PGE is exposed to various forms of market risk, consisting primarily of fluctuations in commodity prices, foreign currency exchange rates, and interest rates, as well as credit risk. Any variations in the Company's market risk or credit risk may affect its future financial position, results of operations, or cash flows, as discussed below. 59 Table of Contents Risk Management Committee PGE has a Risk Management Committee (RMC), which is responsible for providing oversight of the adequacy and effectiveness of corporate policies, guidelines, and procedures for market and credit risk management related to the Company's energy portfolio management activities. The RMC consists of officers and Company representatives with responsibility for risk management, finance and accounting, legal, rates and regulatory affairs, power operations, generation operations, and business development. The RMC reviews and approves adoption of policies and procedures, and monitors compliance with policies, procedures, and limits on a regular basis through reports and meetings. The RMC also reviews and recommends risk limits that are subject to approval by PGE's Board of Directors. Commodity Price Risk PGE is exposed to commodity price risk as its primary business is to provide electricity to its retail customers. The Company engages in price risk management activities to manage exposure to volatility in net power costs for its retail customers. The Company uses power purchase contracts to supplement its own generation and to respond to fluctuations in the demand for electricity and variability in generating plant operations. The Company also enters into contracts for the purchase of fuel for the Company's natural gas- and coal-fired generating plants. These contracts for the purchase of power and fuel expose the Company to market risk. The Company uses instruments such as: forward contracts, which may involve physical delivery of an energy commodity; financial swap and futures agreements, which may require payments to, or receipt of payments from, counterparties based on the differential between a fixed and variable price for the commodity; and option contracts to mitigate risk that arises from market fluctuations of commodity prices. PGE does not engage in trading activities for non-retail purposes. The following table presents energy commodity derivative fair values as a net liability as of December 31, 2017 that are expected to settle in each respective year (in millions): 2018   2019   2020   2021   2022   Thereafter   Total Commodity contracts:                           Electricity $ 10     $ 8     $ 8     $ 8     $ 7     $ 91     $ 132   Natural gas 43     20     7     2      -       -      72     $ 53     $ 28     $ 15     $ 10     $ 7     $ 91     $ 204 PGE reports energy commodity derivative fair values as a net asset or liability, which combines purchases and sales expected to settle in the years noted above. Energy commodity fair values exposed to commodity price risk are primarily related to purchase contracts, which are slightly offset by sales. PGE's energy portfolio activities are subject to regulation, with related costs included in retail prices approved by the OPUC. The timing differences between the recognition of gains and losses on certain derivative instruments and their realization and subsequent recovery in prices are deferred as regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities to reflect the effects of regulation, significantly mitigating commodity price risk for the Company. As contracts are settled, these deferrals reverse and are recognized as Purchased power and fuel in the statements of income and included in the PCAM. PGE remains subject to cash flow risk in the form of collateral requirements based on the value of open positions and regulatory risk if recovery is disallowed by the OPUC. PGE attempts to mitigate both types of risks through prudent energy procurement practices. Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk PGE is exposed to foreign currency risk associated with natural gas forward and swap contracts denominated in Canadian dollars in its energy portfolio. Foreign currency risk is the risk of changes in value of pending financial obligations in foreign currencies that could occur prior to the settlement of the obligation due to a change in the 60 Table of Contents value of that foreign currency in relation to the U.S. dollar. PGE monitors its exposure to fluctuations in the Canadian exchange rate with an appropriate hedging strategy. As of December 31, 2017, a 10% change in the value of the Canadian dollar would result in an immaterial change in exposure for transactions that will settle over the next twelve months. Interest Rate Risk To meet short-term cash requirements, PGE has the ability to issue commercial paper for terms of up to 270 days and has a revolving credit facility that permits same day borrowings. Although any borrowings under the commercial paper program or the revolving credit facility carry a fixed rate during their respective terms, the short-term nature of such borrowings subjects the Company to fluctuations in interest rates that result from changes in market conditions. As of December 31, 2017, PGE had no borrowings outstanding under its revolving credit facility and no commercial paper or other short-term debt outstanding. PGE currently has no financial instruments to mitigate risk related to changes in short-term interest rates, including those on commercial paper; however, it may consider such instruments in the future as considered necessary. As of December 31, 2017, the total fair value and carrying amounts by maturity date of PGE's long-term debt are as follows (in millions): Total Fair Value   Carrying Amounts by Maturity Date   Total   2018   2019   2020   2021   There- after First Mortgage Bonds $ 2,698     $ 2,315     $  -      $ 300     $  -      $ 160     $ 1,855   Pollution Control Revenue Bonds 131     121      -       -       -       -      121   Total $ 2,829     $ 2,436     $  -      $ 300     $  -      $ 160     $ 1,976 As of December 31, 2017, PGE had no long-term debt instruments subject to interest rate risk exposures. Credit Risk PGE is exposed to credit risk in its commodity price risk management activities related to potential nonperformance by counterparties. PGE manages the risk of counterparty default according to its credit policies by performing financial credit reviews, setting limits and monitoring exposures, and requiring collateral (in the form of cash, letters of credit, and guarantees) when needed. The Company also uses standardized enabling agreements and, in certain cases, master netting agreements, which allow for the netting of positive and negative exposures under multiple agreements with counterparties. Despite such mitigation efforts, defaults by counterparties may periodically occur. Based upon periodic review and evaluation, allowances are recorded as needed to reflect credit risk related to wholesale accounts receivable. The large number and diversified base of residential, commercial, and industrial customers, combined with the Company's ability to discontinue service, contribute to reduce credit risk with respect to trade accounts receivable from retail sales. Estimated provisions for uncollectible accounts receivable related to retail sales are provided for such risk. As of December 31, 2017, PGE's credit risk exposure is $9 million for commodity activities with externally-rated investment grade counterparties. The underlying transactions that make up the exposure will mature during 2019. The exposure is included in accounts receivable and price risk management assets, offset by related accounts payable and price risk management liabilities. Investment grade counterparties include those with a minimum credit rating on senior unsecured debt of Baa3 (as assigned by Moody's) or BBB- (as assigned by S&P), and also those counterparties whose obligations are guaranteed or secured by an investment grade entity. The credit exposure includes activity for electricity and natural 61 Table of Contents gas forward, swap, and option contracts. Posted collateral may be in the form of cash or letters of credit, and may represent prepayment or credit exposure assurance. Omitted from the market risk exposures discussed above are long-term power purchase contracts with certain public utility districts in the state of Washington. These contracts currently provide PGE with a percentage share of hydro facility output in exchange for an equivalent percentage share of operating and debt service costs. These contracts expire at varying dates through 2052. For additional information, see ""Public utility districts"" in Note 15, Commitments and Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. - ""Financial Statements and Supplementary Data."" Management believes that circumstances that could result in the nonperformance by these counterparties are remote. 62 Table of Contents","ITEM 8.  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA.

We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017, based on criteria established in Internal Control  -  Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2017, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017, based on criteria established in Internal Control  -  Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO. Basis for Opinions The Company's management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures to respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, 64 Table of Contents accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/ Deloitte & Touche LLP Portland, Oregon February 15, 2018 We have served as the Company's auditor since 2004. 65 Table of Contents PORTLAND GENERAL ELECTRIC COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) Years Ended December 31,   2017   2016   2015 Revenues, net $ 2,009     $ 1,923     $ 1,898   Operating expenses:           Purchased power and fuel 592     617     661   Generation, transmission and distribution 309     286     266   Administrative and other 264     247     241   Depreciation and amortization 345     321     305   Taxes other than income taxes 123     119     116   Total operating expenses 1,633     1,590     1,589   Income from operations 376     333     309   Interest expense, net 120     112     114   Other income:           Allowance for equity funds used during construction 12     21     21   Miscellaneous income, net 5     1     1   Other income, net 17     22     22   Income before income taxes 273     243     217   Income tax expense 86     50     45   Net income $ 187     $ 193     $ 172               Weighted-average shares outstanding (in thousands):           Basic 89,056     88,896     84,180   Diluted 89,176     89,054     84,341               Earnings per share:           Basic $ 2.10     $ 2.17     $ 2.05   Diluted $ 2.10     $ 2.16     $ 2.04 See accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements. 66 Table of Contents PORTLAND GENERAL ELECTRIC COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (In millions) Years Ended December 31,   2017   2016   2015 Net income $ 187     $ 193     $ 172   Other comprehensive (loss) income -

The Company also participates in the wholesale market by purchasing and selling electricity and natural gas in an effort to obtain reasonably-priced power for its retail customers. PGE operates as a single segment, with revenues and costs related to its business activities maintained and analyzed on a total electric operations basis. The Company's corporate headquarters is located in Portland, Oregon and its approximately 4,000 square mile, state-approved service area is located entirely within the State of Oregon. PGE's allocated service area includes 51 incorporated cities, of which Portland and Salem are the largest. As of December 31, 2017, PGE served approximately 875,000 retail customers with a service area population of approximately 1.9 million, comprising approximately 46% of the population of the state. As of December 31, 2017, PGE had 2,906 employees, with 785 employees covered under one of two separate agreements with Local Union No. 125 of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers. Such agreements cover 732 and 53 employees and expire March 2020 and August 2022, respectively. PGE is subject to the jurisdiction of the Public Utility Commission of Oregon (OPUC) with respect to retail prices, utility services, accounting policies and practices, issuances of securities, and certain other matters. Retail prices are based on the Company's cost to serve customers, including an opportunity to earn a reasonable rate of return, as determined by the OPUC. The Company is also subject to regulation by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) in matters related to wholesale energy transactions, transmission services, reliability standards, natural gas pipelines, hydroelectric project licensing, accounting policies and practices, short-term debt issuances, and certain other matters. Consolidation Principles The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of PGE and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. The Company's ownership share of direct expenses and costs related to jointly-owned generating plants are also included in its consolidated financial statements. For further information on PGE's jointly-owned plant, see Note 16, Jointly-Owned Plant. Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. For entities that are determined to meet the definition of a VIE and in which the Company has determined it is the primary beneficiary, the VIE is consolidated and a noncontrolling interest is recognized for any third party interests. This has resulted in the Company consolidating entities in which it has less than a 50% equity interest. There were no material VIEs in 2017 or 2016. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and disclosures of gain or loss contingencies, as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. 73 Table of Contents PORTLAND GENERAL ELECTRIC COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, continued Reclassifications To conform with the 2017 presentation, PGE has reclassified Cash received to be returned to customers pursuant to the Residential Exchange Program, net of amortization of $6 million and $1 million in 2016 and 2015, respectively, and Contribution to voluntary employees' benefit association trust of $2 million and $4 million in 2016 and 2015, respectively, to Other net within the operating activities section of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. PGE has also reclassified the Regulatory deferral of settled derivative instruments of $2 million in both 2016 and 2015 to Other non-cash income and expense, net within the operating activities section of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. NOTE 2: SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Cash and Cash Equivalents Highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at the date of acquisition are classified as cash equivalents, of which PGE had $30 million as of December 31, 2017 and $1 million as of December 31, 2016 included within Cash and cash equivalents in the consolidated balance sheets. Accounts Receivable Accounts receivable are recorded at invoiced amounts based on prices that are subject to federal (FERC) and state (OPUC) regulations. Balances do not bear interest; however, late fees are assessed beginning 16 business days after the invoice due date. Accounts that are inactivated due to nonpayment are charged-off in the period in which the receivable is deemed uncollectible, but no sooner than 45 business days after the due date of the final invoice. Provisions for uncollectible accounts receivable related to retail sales are charged to Administrative and other expense and are recorded in the same period as the related revenues, with an offsetting credit to the allowance for uncollectible accounts. Such estimates are based on management's assessment of the probability of collection, aging of accounts receivable, bad debt write-offs, actual customer billings, and other factors. Provisions for uncollectible accounts receivable related to wholesale sales are charged to Purchased power and fuel expense and are recorded periodically based on a review of counterparty non-performance risk and contractual right of offset when applicable. There have been no material write-offs of accounts receivable related to wholesale sales in 2017, 2016, or 2015. Price Risk Management PGE engages in price risk management activities, utilizing financial instruments such as forward, future, swap, and option contracts for electricity, natural gas, and foreign currency. These instruments are measured at fair value and recorded on the consolidated balance sheets as assets or liabilities from price risk management activities. Changes in fair value are recognized in the consolidated statement of income, offset by the effects of regulatory accounting. Certain electricity forward contracts that were entered into in anticipation of serving the Company's regulated retail load may meet the requirements for treatment under the normal purchases and normal sales scope exception. Such contracts are not recorded at fair value and are recognized under accrual accounting. Price risk management activities are utilized as economic hedges to protect against variability in expected future cash flows due to associated price risk and to manage exposure to volatility in net power costs for the Company's retail customers. In accordance with ratemaking and cost recovery processes authorized by the OPUC, PGE recognizes a regulatory asset or liability to defer unrealized losses or gains, respectively, on derivative instruments until settlement. At the time of settlement, the Company recognizes a realized gain or loss on the derivative instrument. 74 Table of Contents PORTLAND GENERAL ELECTRIC COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, continued Physically settled electricity and natural gas sale and purchase transactions are recorded in Revenues, net and Purchased power and fuel expense, respectively, upon settlement, while transactions that are not physically settled (financial transactions) are recorded on a net basis in Purchased power and fuel expense upon financial settlement. Pursuant to transactions entered into in connection with PGE's price risk management activities, the Company may be required to provide collateral with certain counterparties. The collateral requirements are based on the contract terms and commodity prices and can vary period to period. Cash deposits provided as collateral are included within Other current assets in the consolidated balance sheets and were $11 million and $8 million as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Letters of credit provided as collateral are not recorded on the Company's consolidated balance sheet and were $31 million and $17 million as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Inventories PGE's inventories, which are recorded at average cost, consist primarily of materials and supplies for use in operations, maintenance, and capital activities, as well as fuel, which includes natural gas, coal, and oil for use in the Company's generating plants. Periodically, the Company assesses inventory for purposes of determining that it is recorded at the lower of average cost or net realizable value. Electric Utility Plant Capitalization Policy Electric utility plant is capitalized at original cost, which includes direct labor, materials and supplies, and contractor costs, as well as indirect costs such as engineering, supervision, employee benefits, and an allowance for funds used during construction (AFDC). Plant replacements are capitalized, with minor items charged to expense as incurred. Periodic major maintenance inspections and overhauls at PGE's generating plants are charged to expense as incurred, subject to regulatory accounting as applicable. Costs to purchase or develop software applications for internal use only are capitalized and amortized over the estimated useful life of the software. Costs of obtaining FERC licenses for the Company's hydroelectric projects are capitalized and amortized over the related license period. During the period of construction, costs expected to be included in the final value of the constructed asset, and depreciated once the asset is complete and placed in service, are classified as Construction work-in-progress (CWIP) in Electric utility plant on the consolidated balance sheets. If the project becomes probable of being abandoned, such costs are expensed in the period such determination is made. If any costs are expensed, PGE may seek recovery of such costs in customer prices, although there can be no guarantee such recovery would be granted. Costs disallowed for recovery in customer prices, if any, are charged to expense at the time such disallowance becomes probable. PGE records AFDC, which is intended to represent the Company's cost of funds used for construction purposes, based on the rate granted in the latest general rate case for equity funds and the cost of actual borrowings for debt funds. AFDC is capitalized as part of the cost of plant and credited to the consolidated statements of income. The average rate used by PGE was 7.3% in 2017, 2016, and 2015. AFDC from borrowed funds was $6 million in 2017, $11 million in 2016, and $13 million in 2015 and is reflected as a reduction to Interest expense. AFDC from equity funds, included in Other income, net, was $12 million in 2017, and $21 million in 2016 and 2015. Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method, based upon original cost, and includes an estimate for cost of removal and expected salvage. Depreciation expense as a percent of the related average depreciable plant in 75 Table of Contents PORTLAND GENERAL ELECTRIC COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, continued service was 3.6% in 2017, 3.5% in 2016 and 3.6% in 2015. A component of depreciation expense includes estimated asset retirement removal costs allowed in customer prices. Periodic studies are conducted to update depreciation parameters (i.e. retirement dispersion patterns, average service lives, and net salvage rates), including estimates of asset retirement obligations (AROs) and asset retirement removal costs. The studies are conducted at a minimum of every five years and are filed with the OPUC for approval and inclusion in a future rate proceeding. The most recent depreciation study was completed for 2015, with an order received from the OPUC in September 2017 authorizing new depreciation rates effective January 1, 2018. This study was incorporated into the Company's 2018 general rate case filed with the OPUC in 2017. Thermal generation plants are depreciated using a life-span methodology which ensures that plant investment is recovered by the estimated retirement dates, which range from 2020 to 2059. Depreciation is provided on PGE's other classes of plant in service over their estimated average service lives, which are as follows (in years): Generation, excluding thermal:   Hydro 95   Wind 30   Transmission 57   Distribution 45   General 12 When property is retired and removed from service, the original cost of the depreciable property units, net of any related salvage value, is charged to accumulated depreciation. Cost of removal expenditures are recorded against AROs or to accumulated asset retirement removal costs, if applicable, and included in Regulatory liabilities. Intangible plant consists primarily of computer software development costs, which are amortized over either five or  ten years, and hydro licensing costs, which are amortized over the applicable license term, which range from 30 to 50 years. Accumulated amortization was $296 million and $257 million as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, with amortization expense of $46 million in 2017, and $44 million in 2016 and $38 million in 2015. Future estimated amortization expense as of December 31, 2017 is as follows: $49 million in 2018; $48 million in 2019; $43 million in 2020; $35 million in 2021; and $28 million in 2022. Marketable Securities All of PGE's investments in marketable securities, included in the Non-qualified benefit plan trust and Nuclear decommissioning trust on the consolidated balance sheets, are classified as trading. These securities are classified as noncurrent because they are not available for use in operations. Trading securities are stated at fair value based on quoted market prices. Realized and unrealized gains and losses on the Non-qualified benefit plan trust assets are included in Other income, net. Realized and unrealized gains and losses on the Nuclear decommissioning trust fund assets are recorded as regulatory liabilities or assets, respectively, for future ratemaking treatment. The cost of securities sold is based on the average cost method. Regulatory Accounting Regulatory Assets and Liabilities As a rate-regulated enterprise, PGE applies regulatory accounting, which results in the creation of regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities. Regulatory assets represent: i) probable future revenue associated with certain actual or estimated costs that are expected to be recovered from customers through the ratemaking process; or ii) probable future collections from customers resulting from revenue accrued for completed alternative revenue programs, provided certain criteria are met. Regulatory liabilities represent probable future reductions in revenue associated 76 Table of Contents PORTLAND GENERAL ELECTRIC COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, continued with amounts that are expected to be credited to customers through the ratemaking process. Regulatory accounting is appropriate as long as: prices are established by, or subject to, approval by independent third-party regulators; prices are designed to recover the specific enterprise's cost of service; and in view of demand for service, it is reasonable to assume that prices set at levels that will recover costs can be charged to and collected from customers. Once the regulatory asset or liability is reflected in prices, the respective regulatory asset or liability is amortized to the appropriate line item in the consolidated statement of income over the period in which it is included in prices. Circumstances that could result in the discontinuance of regulatory accounting include: i) increased competition that restricts PGE's ability to establish prices to recover specific costs; and ii) a significant change in the manner in which prices are set by regulators from cost-based regulation to another form of regulation. The Company periodically reviews the criteria of regulatory accounting to ensure that its continued application is appropriate. Based on a current evaluation of the various factors and conditions, management believes that recovery of PGE's regulatory assets is probable. For additional information concerning the Company's regulatory assets and liabilities, see Note 6, Regulatory Assets and Liabilities. Power Cost Adjustment Mechanism PGE is subject to a power cost adjustment mechanism (PCAM) as approved by the OPUC. Pursuant to the PCAM, the Company can adjust future customer prices to reflect a portion of the difference between net variable power costs (NVPC) forecast each year and included in customer prices (baseline NVPC) and actual NVPC. NVPC consists of the cost of power purchased and fuel used to generate electricity to meet PGE's retail load requirements, as well as the cost of settled electric and natural gas financial contracts, all of which is classified as Purchased power and fuel in the Company's consolidated statements of income, and is net of wholesale sales, which are classified as Revenues, net in the consolidated statements of income. The Company is subject to a portion of the business risk or benefit associated with the difference between actual and baseline NVPC by application of an asymmetrical deadband, which ranges from $15 million below to $30 million above baseline NVPC. To the extent actual NVPC, subject to certain adjustments, is outside the deadband range, the PCAM provides for 90% of the excess variance to be collected from or refunded to customers. Pursuant to a regulated earnings test, a refund will occur only to the extent that it results in PGE's actual regulated return on equity (ROE) for the given year being no less than 1% above the Company's latest authorized ROE, while a collection will occur only to the extent that it results in PGE's actual regulated ROE for that year being no greater than 1% below the Company's authorized ROE. PGE's authorized ROE was 9.6% for 2017, 9.6% for 2016, and 9.68% for 2015. Any estimated refund to customers pursuant to the PCAM is recorded as a reduction in Revenues, net in PGE's consolidated statements of income, while any estimated collection from customers is recorded as a reduction in Purchased power and fuel expense. A final determination of any customer refund or collection is made in the following year by the OPUC through a public filing and review. The PCAM has resulted in no collection from, or refund to, customers since 2011. Asset Retirement Obligations Legal obligations related to the future retirement of tangible long-lived assets are classified as AROs on PGE's consolidated balance sheet. An ARO is recognized in the period in which the legal obligation is incurred, and when the fair value of the liability can be reasonably estimated. Due to the long lead time involved until decommissioning activities occur, the Company uses present value techniques because quoted market prices and market-risk premiums are not available. The present value of estimated future decommissioning costs is capitalized and 77 Table of Contents PORTLAND GENERAL ELECTRIC COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, continued included in Electric utility plant, net on the consolidated balance sheets with a corresponding offset to ARO. Such estimates are revised periodically, with actual expenditures charged to the ARO as incurred. The estimated capitalized costs of AROs are depreciated over the estimated life of the related asset, which is included in Depreciation and amortization in the consolidated statements of income. Changes in the ARO resulting from the passage of time (accretion) is based on the original discount rate and recognized as an increase in the carrying amount of the liability and as a charge to accretion expense, which is included in Depreciation and amortization expense in the Company's consolidated statements of income. For additional information concerning the Company's AROs, see Note 7, Asset Retirement Obligations. The difference between the timing of the recognition of ARO depreciation and accretion expenses and the amount included in customers' prices is recorded as a regulatory asset or liability in the Company's consolidated balance sheets. PGE had a regulatory liability related to AROs in the amount of $52 million as of December 31, 2017 and $49 million as of December 31, 2016. For additional information concerning the Company's regulatory liability related to AROs, see Note 6, Regulatory Assets and Liabilities. Contingencies Contingencies are evaluated using the best information available at the time the consolidated financial statements are prepared. Legal costs incurred in connection with loss contingencies are expensed as incurred. Loss contingencies are accrued, and disclosed if material, when it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability incurred as of the financial statement date and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. If a reasonable estimate of probable loss cannot be determined, a range of loss may be established, in which case the minimum amount in the range is accrued, unless some other amount within the range appears to be a better estimate. A loss contingency will also be disclosed when it is reasonably possible that an asset has been impaired or a liability incurred if the estimate or range of potential loss is material. If a probable or reasonably possible loss cannot be determined, then the Company: i) discloses an estimate of such loss or the range of such loss, if the Company is able to determine such an estimate; or ii) discloses that an estimate cannot be made and the reasons. If an asset has been impaired or a liability incurred after the financial statement date, but prior to the issuance of the financial statements, the loss contingency is disclosed, if material, and the amount of any estimated loss is recorded in the subsequent reporting period. Gain contingencies are recognized when realized and are disclosed when material. Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss Accumulated other comprehensive loss (AOCL) presented on the consolidated balance sheets is comprised of the difference between the non-qualified benefit plans' obligations recognized in net income and the unfunded position. Revenue Recognition Revenues are recognized as electricity is delivered to customers and include amounts for any services provided. Franchise taxes, which are collected from customers and remitted to taxing authorities, are recorded on a gross basis in PGE's consolidated statements of income. Amounts collected from customers are included in Revenues, net and amounts due to taxing authorities are included in Taxes other than income taxes and totaled $43 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015. Retail revenue is billed monthly based on meter readings taken throughout the month. Unbilled revenue represents the revenue earned from the time of the last meter read date through the last day of the month, a period that has not 78 Table of Contents PORTLAND GENERAL ELECTRIC COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, continued been billed as of the last day of the month. Unbilled revenue is calculated based on actual net retail system load each month, the number of days from the last meter read date through the last day of the month, and current retail customer prices. As a rate-regulated utility, PGE, in certain situations, recognizes revenue to be billed to customers in future periods or defers the recognition of certain revenues to the period in which the related costs are incurred or approved by the OPUC for amortization. For additional information, see ""Regulatory Assets and Liabilities"" in this Note 2. Stock-Based Compensation The measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share-based payment awards, including restricted stock units, is based on the estimated fair value of the awards. The fair value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense over the requisite vesting period. PGE attributes the value of stock-based compensation to expense on a straight-line basis. For additional information concerning the Company's Stock-Based Compensation, see Note 13, Stock-Based Compensation Expense. Income Taxes Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between financial statement carrying amounts and tax bases of assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in current and future periods that includes the enactment date. Any valuation allowance would be established to reduce deferred tax assets to the ""more likely than not"" amount expected to be realized in future tax returns. Because PGE is a rate-regulated enterprise, changes in certain deferred tax assets and liabilities are required to be passed on to customers through future prices and are charged or credited directly to a regulatory asset or regulatory liability. Such amounts were recognized as net regulatory liabilities of $277 million and net regulatory assets of $86 million as of December 31, 2017, and 2016, respectively, and will be included in prices when the temporary differences reverse. Unrecognized tax benefits represent management's expected treatment of a tax position taken in a filed tax return, or planned to be taken in a future tax return, that has not been reflected in measuring income tax expense for financial reporting purposes. Until such positions are no longer considered uncertain, PGE would not recognize the tax benefits resulting from such positions and would report the tax effect as a liability in the Company's consolidated balance sheet. PGE records any interest and penalties related to income tax deficiencies in Interest expense and Other income, net, respectively, in the consolidated statements of income. Recent Accounting Pronouncements Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) (ASU 2014-09), creates a new Topic 606 and supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in Topic 605, Revenue Recognition, and most industry-specific guidance throughout the Industry Topics of the Codification. ASU 2014-09 provides a five-step analysis of transactions to determine when and how revenue is recognized that consists of: i) identify the contract with the customer; ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract; iii) determine the transaction price; iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations; and v) recognize revenue when or as each performance obligation is satisfied. Companies can transition to the requirements of this ASU either retrospectively (full retrospective method) or as a cumulative-effect adjustment as of the effective date (modified 79 Table of Contents PORTLAND GENERAL ELECTRIC COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, continued retrospective method), which is January 1, 2018 for calendar year-end public entities. The Company plans to elect the modified retrospective method for implementation. PGE does not anticipate any material changes to its revenue recognition policy for tariff-based revenues, which comprises a majority of PGE's retail, wholesale, and other revenues, as performance obligations are expected to be satisfied in a similar recognition pattern. PGE continues to finalize its evaluation of certain matters of presentation such as alternative revenue programs (including decoupling) and enhanced required disclosures. In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) which supersedes the current lease accounting requirements for lessees and lessors within Topic 840, Leases. Pursuant to the new standard, lessees will be required to recognize all leases, including operating leases, on the balance sheet and record corresponding right-of-use assets and lease liabilities. Accounting for lessors is substantially unchanged from current accounting principles. Lessees will be required to classify leases as either finance leases or operating leases. Initial balance sheet measurement is similar for both types of leases; however, expense recognition and amortization of right-of-use assets will differ. Operating leases will reflect lease expense on a straight-line basis, while finance leases will result in the separate presentation of interest expense on the lease liability (as calculated using the effective interest method) and amortization expense of the right-of-use asset. Quantitative and qualitative disclosures will also be required surrounding significant judgments made by management. The provisions of this pronouncement are effective for calendar year-end, public entities on January 1, 2019. As issued, ASU 2016-02 requires transition under a modified retrospective basis as of the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented, however the Company is monitoring the FASB's decisions regarding potential transition practical expedients that would allow companies to adopt the new standard with a cumulative effect adjustment as of the beginning of the year of adoption with prior year comparative financial information and disclosures remaining as previously reported. Early adoption is permitted, but the Company does not plan to early adopt. In January 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-01, Leases (Topic 842) Land Easement Practical Expedient for Transition to Topic 842, which amends ASU 2016-02 to provide entities an optional transition practical expedient to not evaluate under Topic 842 existing or expired land easements that were not previously accounted for as leases under the current leases guidance in Topic 842. An entity that elects this practical expedient should evaluate new or modified land easements under Topic 842 beginning at the date that the entity adopts Topic 842. PGE plans to elect this practical expedient. The Company is monitoring utility industry implementation issues that may change existing and future lease classification in areas such as purchase power agreements, pipeline laterals, utility pole attachments, and other utility industry-related arrangements. In conjunction with monitoring industry issues that may impact lease classification, the Company is in the process of evaluating whether it will elect to adopt certain other, optional practical expedients included within the standard. Decisions surrounding the election of practical expedients may impact the Company's lease population that is ultimately recorded. As a result, PGE has not yet quantified the estimated financial statement impact, but overall, the Company does expect an increase in the recognition of right-of-use assets and lease liabilities on the Company's consolidated balance sheet. In March 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-07, Compensation-Retirement Benefits (Topic 715), Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost (ASU 2017-07). Pursuant to this ASU, only the service cost component of net periodic pension and postretirement benefit costs will be eligible for capitalization and should be applied on a prospective basis upon implementation. Also, the non-service components are required to be presented in the income statement separately from the service cost component and outside the subtotal of income from operations and should be applied on a retrospective basis upon implementation. For calendar year-end public entities, the update will be effective for annual periods beginning January 1, 2018. The Company does not plan to early adopt. For ratemaking purposes, the Company will continue to be allowed to recover this portion of the non-service costs as a component of rate base, however such amounts will be recorded as Regulatory assets on the Company's condensed consolidated balance sheets, instead of Utility plant, and amortized in a systematic and rational manner and reflected as expense in a line item outside the subtotal of income from operations on the condensed consolidated statements of income and other comprehensive income. PGE estimates the portion of the non-service components of net periodic pension and postretirement benefit costs that is eligible for deferral for ratemaking purposes, to be $3 million for the twelve month period ending December 31, 2018, and 80 Table of Contents PORTLAND GENERAL ELECTRIC COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, continued is deemed to have an immaterial impact on the Company's consolidated financial position and consolidated results of operations. NOTE 3: BALANCE SHEET COMPONENTS Accounts Receivable, Net Accounts receivable is net of an allowance for uncollectible accounts of $6 million as of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016.

The Nuclear decommissioning trust includes amounts collected from customers less qualified expenditures plus any realized and unrealized gains and losses on the investments held therein. In 2014 and 2013, the Company received $6 million and $44 million, respectively, from the settlement of a legal matter concerning costs associated with the operation of the ISFSI. Those funds were deposited into the Nuclear decommissioning trust. For additional information concerning the legal matter, see Note 7, Asset Retirement Obligations. In anticipation of the refund of the settlement amount to customers over a three-year period that began in 2015, those funds were withdrawn from the Nuclear decommissioning trust during 2015. Non-qualified benefit plan trust - Reflects assets held in trust to cover the obligations of PGE's non-qualified benefit plans and represents contributions made by the Company less qualified expenditures plus any realized and unrealized gains and losses on the investment held therein. The trusts are comprised of the following investments as of December 31 (in millions): Nuclear     Decommissioning Trust           Non-Qualified Benefit     Plan Trust   2017   2016   2017   2016 Cash equivalents $ 25     $ 21     $ 1     $ 1   Marketable securities, at fair value:               Equity securities  -       -      7     6   Debt securities 17     20     1     1   Insurance contracts, at cash surrender value  -       -      28     26     $ 42     $ 41     $ 37     $ 34 For information concerning the fair value measurement of those assets recorded at fair value held in the trusts, see Note 4, Fair Value of Financial Instruments. 81 Table of Contents PORTLAND GENERAL ELECTRIC COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, continued Other Current Assets and Accrued Expenses and Other Current Liabilities Other current assets and Accrued expenses and other current liabilities consist of the following (in millions): As of December 31,   2017   2016 Other current assets:       Prepaid expenses $ 50     $ 48   Margin deposits 11     8   Assets from price risk management activities 6     18   Other 6     3     $ 73     $ 77   Accrued expenses and other current liabilities:       Regulatory liabilities - current $ 31     $ 51   Accrued employee compensation and benefits 60     52   Accrued dividends payable 31     30   Accrued interest payable 27     25   Accrued taxes payable 31     25   Other 61     71     $ 241     $ 254 NOTE 4: FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS PGE determines the fair value of financial instruments, both assets and liabilities recognized and not recognized in the Company's consolidated balance sheets, for which it is practicable to estimate fair value as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, and then classifies these financial assets and liabilities based on a fair value hierarchy that is used to prioritize the inputs to the valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The three levels and application to the Company are discussed below. Level 1 Quoted prices are available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the measurement date. Level 2 Pricing inputs include those that are directly or indirectly observable in the marketplace as of the measurement date. Level 3 Pricing inputs include significant inputs which are unobservable for the asset or liability. Financial assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The Company's assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgment, and may affect the valuation of fair value assets and liabilities and their placement within the fair value hierarchy. Assets measured at fair value using net asset value (NAV) as a practical expedient are not categorized in the fair value hierarchy. These assets are listed in the totals of the fair value hierarchy to permit the reconciliation to amounts presented in the financial statements. PGE recognizes transfers between levels in the fair value hierarchy as of the end of the reporting period for all of its financial instruments. Changes to market liquidity conditions, the availability of observable inputs, or changes in the economic structure of a security marketplace may require transfer of the securities between levels. There were no significant transfers between levels during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, except those presented in this note. 82 Table of Contents PORTLAND GENERAL ELECTRIC COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, continued The Company's financial assets and liabilities whose values were recognized at fair value are as follows by level within the fair value hierarchy (in millions): As of December 31, 2017   Level 1   Level 2   Level 3   Other(2)   Total Assets:                   Nuclear decommissioning trust: (1)                   Debt securities:                   Domestic government $ 4     $ 7     $  -      $  -      $ 11   Corporate credit  -      6      -       -      6   Money market funds measured at NAV (2)  -       -       -      25     25   Non-qualified benefit plan trust: (3)                   Money market funds 1      -       -       -      1   Equity securities - domestic 7      -       -       -      7   Debt securities - domestic government 1      -       -       -      1   Investments measured at NAV: (2)                   Collective trust - domestic equity  -       -       -       -       -    Assets from price risk management activities: (1) (4)                   Electricity  -      3      -       -      3   Natural gas  -      3      -       -      3     $ 13     $ 19     $  -      $ 25     $ 57   Liabilities - Liabilities from price risk management activities: (1) (4)                   Electricity $  -      $ 5     $ 130     $  -      $ 135   Natural gas  -      66     9      -      75     $  -      $ 71     $ 139     $  -      $ 210 (1) Activities are subject to regulation, with certain gains and losses deferred pursuant to regulatory accounting and included in regulatory assets or regulatory liabilities as appropriate.

Assets held in the Nuclear decommissioning trust (NDT) and Non-qualified benefit plan (NQBP) trusts are recorded at fair value in PGE's consolidated balance sheets and invested in securities that are exposed to interest rate, credit, and market volatility risks. These assets are classified within Level 1, 2, or 3 based on the following factors: Debt securities - PGE invests in highly-liquid United States Treasury securities to support the investment objectives of the trusts. These domestic government securities are classified as Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy due to the availability of quoted prices for identical assets in an active market as of the measurement date. Assets classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy include domestic government debt securities, such as municipal debt, and corporate credit securities. Prices are determined by evaluating pricing data such as broker quotes for similar securities and adjusted for observable differences. Significant inputs used in valuation models generally include benchmark yield and issuer spreads. The external credit rating, coupon rate, and maturity of each security are considered in the valuation as applicable. Equity securities - Equity mutual fund and common stock securities are classified as Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy due to the availability of quoted prices for identical assets in an active market as of the 84 Table of Contents PORTLAND GENERAL ELECTRIC COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, continued measurement date. Principal markets for equity prices include published exchanges such as NASDAQ and the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). Money market funds - PGE invests in money market funds that seek to maintain a stable net asset value. These funds invest in high-quality, short-term, diversified money market instruments, short-term treasury bills, federal agency securities, certificates of deposits, and commercial paper. The Company believes the redemption value of these funds is likely to be the fair value, which is represented by the net asset value. Redemption is permitted daily without written notice. The NQBP trust is invested in exchange traded government money market funds and is classified as Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy due to the availability of quoted prices in published exchanges such as NASDAQ and the NYSE. The money market fund in the NDT is valued at NAV as a practical expedient and is not included in the fair value hierarchy. Common and collective trust funds - PGE invests in common and collective trust funds that invests in equity securities. The Company believes the redemption value of these funds is likely to be the fair value, which is represented by the net asset value as a practical expedient. The funds allow for daily liquidity with appropriate notice. Common and collective trusts are not classified in the fair value hierarchy as they are valued at NAV as a practical expedient. All collective trusts for the NQBP were liquidated during 2017. Assets and liabilities from price risk management activities are recorded at fair value in PGE's consolidated balance sheets and consist of derivative instruments entered into by the Company to manage its exposure to commodity price risk and foreign currency exchange rate risk, and reduce volatility in NVPC for the Company's retail customers. For additional information regarding these assets and liabilities, see Note 5, Price Risk Management. For those assets and liabilities from price risk management activities classified as Level 2, fair value is derived using present value formulas that utilize inputs such as forward commodity prices and interest rates. Substantially all of these inputs are observable in the marketplace throughout the full term of the instrument, can be derived from observable data, or are supported by observable levels at which transactions are executed in the marketplace. Instruments in this category include commodity forwards, futures, and swaps. Assets and liabilities from price risk management activities classified as Level 3 consist of instruments for which fair value is derived using one or more significant inputs that are not observable for the entire term of the instrument. These instruments consist of longer term commodity forwards, futures, and swaps. 85 Table of Contents PORTLAND GENERAL ELECTRIC COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, continued Quantitative information regarding the significant, unobservable inputs used in the measurement of Level 3 assets and liabilities from price risk management activities is presented below: Significant   Price per Unit     Fair Value   Valuation   Unobservable           Weighted Commodity Contracts   Assets   Liabilities   Technique   Input   Low   High   Average     (in millions)                     As of December 31, 2017:                         Electricity physical forward   $  -      $ 130     Discounted cash flow   Electricity forward price (per MWh)   $ 7.79     $ 41.23     $ 30.95   Natural gas financial swaps    -      9     Discounted cash flow   Natural gas forward price (per Dth)   1.26     2.92     1.90   Electricity financial futures    -       -      Discounted cash flow   Electricity forward price (per MWh)   7.79     29.74     21.74       $  -      $ 139                       As of December 31, 2016:                         Electricity physical forward   $  -      $ 112     Discounted cash flow   Electricity forward price (per MWh)   $ 14.25     $ 54.73     $ 38.18   Natural gas financial swaps   1     9     Discounted cash flow   Natural gas forward price (per Dth)   1.85     4.92     2.64   Electricity financial futures   1      -      Discounted cash flow   Electricity forward price (per MWh)   8.57     33.60     25.10       $ 2     $ 121 The significant unobservable inputs used in the Company's fair value measurement of price risk management assets and liabilities are long-term forward prices for commodity derivatives. For shorter term contracts, PGE employs the mid-point of the bid-ask spread of the market and these inputs are derived using observed transactions in active markets, as well as historical experience as a participant in those markets. These price inputs are validated against independent market data from multiple sources. For certain long-term contracts, observable, liquid market transactions are not available for the duration of the delivery period. In such instances, the Company uses internally-developed price curves, which derive longer term prices and utilize observable data when available. When not available, regression techniques are used to estimate unobservable future prices. In addition, changes in the fair value measurement of price risk management assets and liabilities are analyzed and reviewed on a quarterly basis by the Company. The Company's Level 3 assets and liabilities from price risk management activities are sensitive to market price changes in the respective underlying commodities. The significance of the impact is dependent upon the magnitude of the price change and the Company's position as either the buyer or seller of the contract. Sensitivity of the fair value measurements to changes in the significant unobservable inputs is as follows: Significant Unobservable Input   Position   Change to Input   Impact on Fair Value Measurement Market price   Buy   Increase (decrease)   Gain (loss) Market price   Sell   Increase (decrease)   Loss (gain) 86 Table of Contents PORTLAND GENERAL ELECTRIC COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, continued Changes in the fair value of net liabilities from price risk management activities (net of assets from price risk management activities) classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy were as follows (in millions): Years Ended December 31,   2017   2016 Net liabilities from price risk management activities as of beginning of year $ 119     $ 119   Net realized and unrealized losses * 35     11   Net transfers in to Level 3 from Level 2  -      (1 ) Net transfers out of Level 3 to Level 2 (15 )   (10 ) Net liabilities from price risk management activities as of end of year $ 139     $ 119   Level 3 net unrealized losses that have been fully offset by the effect of regulatory accounting $ 41     $ 11 * Includes $6 million in net realized losses in 2017 and none in 2016. Transfers into Level 3 occur when significant inputs used to value the Company's derivative instruments become less observable, such as a delivery location becoming significantly less liquid. During the year ended December 31, 2017, there were no transfers into Level 3 from Level 2, as reflected in the table above. During 2016, there was $1 million transferred into Level 3. Transfers out of Level 3 occur when the significant inputs become more observable, such as when the time between the valuation date and the delivery term of a transaction becomes shorter. PGE records transfers in and transfers out of Level 3 at the end of the reporting period for all of its derivative instruments. Transfers from Level 2 to Level 1 for the Company's price risk management assets and liabilities do not occur as quoted prices are not available for identical instruments. As such, the Company's assets and liabilities from price risk management activities mature and settle as Level 2 fair value measurements. Long-term debt is recorded at amortized cost in PGE's consolidated balance sheets. The fair value of the Company's First Mortgage Bonds (FMBs) and Pollution Control Revenue Bonds (PCBs) is classified as a Level 2 fair value measurement and is estimated based on the quoted market prices for the same or similar issues or on the current rates offered to PGE for debt of similar remaining maturities. The fair value of PGE's unsecured term bank loans was classified as Level 3 fair value measurement and was estimated based on the terms of the loans and the Company's creditworthiness. The significant unobservable inputs to the Level 3 fair value measurement included the interest rate and the length of the loan. The estimated fair value of the Company's unsecured term bank loans approximated their carrying value. As of December 31, 2017, the carrying amount of PGE's long-term debt was $2,426 million, net of $10 million of unamortized debt expense, and its estimated aggregate fair value was $2,829 million, all of which is classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. As of December 31, 2016, the carrying amount of PGE's long-term debt was $2,350 million, net of $11 million of unamortized debt expense, with an estimated aggregate fair value of $2,693 million, consisting of $2,543 million and $150 million classified as Level 2 and Level 3, respectively, in the fair value hierarchy. For fair value information concerning the Company's pension plan assets, see Note 10, Employee Benefits. NOTE 5: PRICE RISK MANAGEMENT PGE participates in the wholesale marketplace in order to balance its supply of power, which consists of its own generation combined with wholesale market transactions, to meet the needs of its retail customers, manage risk, and administer its existing long-term wholesale contracts. Such activities include purchases and sales of both power and fuel resulting from economic dispatch decisions for Company-owned generating resources. As a result of this 87 Table of Contents PORTLAND GENERAL ELECTRIC COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, continued ongoing business activity, PGE is exposed to commodity price risk and foreign currency exchange rate risk, from which changes in prices and/or rates may affect the Company's financial position, results of operations, or cash flow. PGE utilizes derivative instruments to manage its exposure to commodity price risk and foreign exchange rate risk in order to manage volatility in net variable power costs for its retail customers. Such derivative instruments may include forward, futures, swap, and option contracts, which are recorded at fair value on the consolidated balance sheet, for electricity, natural gas, oil, and foreign currency, with changes in fair value recorded in the consolidated statements of income. In accordance with ratemaking and cost recovery processes authorized by the OPUC, the Company recognizes a regulatory asset or liability to defer the gains and losses from derivative activity until settlement of the associated derivative instrument. PGE may designate certain derivative instruments as cash flow hedges or may use derivative instruments as economic hedges. The Company does not engage in trading activities for non-retail purposes. PGE's Assets and Liabilities from price risk management activities consist of the following (in millions): As of December 31,     2017   2016   Current assets:         Commodity contracts:         Electricity $ 3     $ 6     Natural gas 3     12     Total current derivative assets 6   (1) 18   (1) Noncurrent assets:         Commodity contracts:         Electricity  -      1     Natural gas  -      4     Total noncurrent derivative assets  -    (2) 5   (2) Total derivative assets not designated as hedging instruments $ 6     $ 23     Total derivative assets $ 6     $ 23     Current liabilities:         Commodity contracts:         Electricity $ 13     $ 12     Natural gas 46     32     Total current derivative liabilities 59     44     Noncurrent liabilities:         Commodity contracts:         Electricity 122     106     Natural gas 29     19     Total noncurrent derivative liabilities 151     125     Total derivative liabilities not designated as hedging instruments $ 210     $ 169     Total derivative liabilities $ 210     $ 169 (1) Included in Other current assets on the consolidated balance sheets.

In the case of default on, or termination of, any contract under the master netting arrangements, such agreements provide for the net settlement of all related contractual obligations with a given counterparty through a single payment. These types of transactions may include non-derivative instruments, derivatives qualifying for scope exceptions, receivables and payables arising from settled positions, and other forms of non-cash collateral, such as letters of credit. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, gross amounts included as Price risk management liabilities subject to master netting agreements were $136 million and $115 million, respectively, for which PGE posted collateral of $11 million for 2017 and 2016, which consisted entirely of letters of credit. As of December 31, 2017, of the gross amounts included, $130 million was for electricity and $6 million was for natural gas compared to $112 million for electricity and $3 million for natural gas recognized as of December 31, 2016. Net realized and unrealized losses (gains) on derivative transactions not designated as hedging instruments are classified in Purchased power and fuel in the consolidated statements of income and were as follows (in millions): Years Ended December 31,   2017   2016   2015 Commodity contracts:           Electricity $ 41     $ 34     $ 72   Natural Gas 85     (56 )   103   Foreign currency exchange (1 )    -      1 Net unrealized and certain net realized losses (gains) presented in the table above are offset within the consolidated statements of income by the effects of regulatory accounting. Net losses of $82 million, net gains of $13 million, and net losses of $160 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively, have been offset in Net income. Assuming no changes in market prices and interest rates, the following table presents the year in which the net unrealized loss recorded as of December 31, 2017 related to PGE's derivative activities would be realized as a result of the settlement of the underlying derivative instrument (in millions): 2018   2019   2020   2021   2022   Thereafter   Total Commodity contracts:                           Electricity $ 10     $ 8     $ 8     $ 8     $ 7     $ 91     $ 132   Natural gas 43     20     7     2      -       -      72   Net unrealized loss $ 53     $ 28     $ 15     $ 10     $ 7     $ 91     $ 204 89 Table of Contents PORTLAND GENERAL ELECTRIC COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, continued PGE's secured and unsecured debt is currently rated at investment grade by Moody's Investors Service (Moody's) and S&P Global Ratings (S&P). Should Moody's and/or S&P reduce their rating on the Company's unsecured debt to below investment grade, PGE could be subject to requests by certain wholesale counterparties to post additional performance assurance collateral, in the form of cash or letters of credit, based on total portfolio positions with each of those counterparties. Certain other counterparties would have the right to terminate their agreements with the Company. The aggregate fair value of all derivative instruments with credit-risk-related contingent features that were in a liability position as of December 31, 2017 was $205 million, for which the Company had posted $31 million in collateral, consisting entirely of letters of credit. If the credit-risk-related contingent features underlying these agreements were triggered at December 31, 2017, the cash requirement to either post as collateral or settle the instruments immediately would have been $202 million. As of December 31, 2017, PGE had no posted cash collateral for derivative instruments with no credit-risk-related contingent features. Cash collateral for derivative instruments is classified as Margin deposits included in Other current assets on the Company's consolidated balance sheet. Counterparties representing 10% or more of Assets and Liabilities from price risk management activities were as follows: As of December 31,   2017   2016 Assets from price risk management activities:       Counterparty A 39 %   22 % Counterparty B 12     17   Counterparty C 3     12     54 %   51 % Liabilities from price risk management activities:       Counterparty D 62 %   66 %   62 %   66 % For additional information concerning the determination of fair value for the Company's Assets and Liabilities from price risk management activities, see Note 4, Fair Value of Financial Instruments. 90 Table of Contents PORTLAND GENERAL ELECTRIC COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, continued NOTE 6: REGULATORY ASSETS AND LIABILITIES The majority of PGE's regulatory assets and liabilities are reflected in customer prices and are amortized over the period in which they are reflected in customer prices. Items not currently reflected in prices are pending before the regulatory body as discussed below. Regulatory assets and liabilities consist of the following (dollars in millions): Weighted Average Remaining Life (1)   As of December 31,   2017   2016   Current   Noncurrent   Current   Noncurrent Regulatory assets:                   Price risk management (2) 6 years   $ 53     $ 151     $ 26     $ 120   Pension and other postretirement plans (2) (3)    -      218      -      235   Deferred income taxes (6) (4)    -       -       -      86   Debt issuance costs (2) 6 years    -      19      -      22   Other (5) Various   9     50     10     35   Total regulatory assets     $ 62     $ 438     $ 36     $ 498   Regulatory liabilities:                   Asset retirement removal costs (6) (4)   $  -      $ 933     $  -      $ 887   Deferred income taxes (6) (4)    -      277      -       -    Trojan decommissioning activities 5 years   3      -      18      -    Asset retirement obligations (6) (4)    -      52      -      49   Other Various   28     26     33     22   Total regulatory liabilities     $ 31   (7) $ 1,288     $ 51   (7) $ 958 (1) As of December 31, 2017. (2) Does not include a return on investment. (3) Recovery expected over the average service life of employees. (4) Recovery or refund expected over the estimated lives of the net balance. (5) Of the total other unamortized regulatory asset balances, a return is recorded on $51 million and $44 million as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. (6) Included in rate base for ratemaking purposes. (7) Included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. As of December 31, 2017, PGE had regulatory assets of $51 million earning a return on investment at the following rates: i) $14 million earning a return by inclusion in rate base; ii) $25 million at the approved rate for deferred accounts under amortization, ranging from 1.47% to 2.38%, depending on the year of approval; iii) $10 million at PGE's 2017 cost of capital of 7.51%, and iv) $2 million at a rate of the 5-year Treasury rate plus 100 basis points, which currently equates to 2.87%. Price risk management represents the difference between the net unrealized losses recognized on derivative instruments related to price risk management activities and their realization and subsequent recovery in customer prices. For further information regarding assets and liabilities from price risk management activities, see Note 5, Price Risk Management. 91 Table of Contents PORTLAND GENERAL ELECTRIC COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, continued Pension and other postretirement plans represents unrecognized components of the benefit plans' funded status, which are recoverable in customer prices when recognized in net periodic benefit cost. For further information, see Note 10, Employee Benefits. Deferred income taxes represents income tax benefits primarily from property-related timing differences that previously flowed to customers and will be included in customer prices when the temporary differences reverse. In 2017, the net regulatory liability was increased by $357 million as the Company deferred the impact of re-measuring accumulated deferred income taxes pursuant to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the TCJA) on December 22, 2017. PGE has proposed to defer and refund the net benefits of the change in tax law under a deferral application filed with the OPUC on December 29, 2017. Substantially all of the amounts deferred under the proposed deferral application are subject to tax normalization rules that require that the impact to the results of operations of amortizing the excess deferred income tax balance cannot occur more rapidly than would have occurred before the change in tax law. The Company plans to use the average rate assumption method to account for the refund to customers. For further information, see Note 11, Income Taxes. Debt issuance costs represents unrecognized debt issuance costs related to debt instruments retired prior to the stipulated maturity date. Asset retirement removal costs represents the costs that do not qualify as AROs and are a component of depreciation expense allowed in customer prices. Such costs are recorded as a regulatory liability as they are collected in prices, and are reduced by actual removal costs incurred. Trojan decommissioning activities represents proceeds received for the settlement of a legal matter concerning the reimbursement from the United States Department of Energy (USDOE) of certain monitoring costs incurred related to spent nuclear fuel at Trojan, as well as ongoing costs and collections associated with decommissioning activities. Asset retirement obligations represents the difference in the timing of recognition of: i) the amounts recognized for depreciation expense of the asset retirement costs and accretion of the ARO; and ii) the amount recovered in customer prices. NOTE 7: ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS AROs consist of the following (in millions): As of December 31,   2017   2016 Trojan decommissioning activities $ 45     $ 44   Utility plant 109     105   Non-utility property 13     12   Asset retirement obligations $ 167     $ 161 Trojan decommissioning activities represents the present value of future decommissioning costs for the plant, which ceased operation in 1993. The remaining decommissioning activities primarily consist of the long-term operation and decommissioning of the ISFSI, an interim dry storage facility that is licensed by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. The ISFSI is to house the spent nuclear fuel at the former plant site until an off-site storage facility is available. Decommissioning of the ISFSI and final site restoration activities will begin once shipment of all the spent fuel to a USDOE facility is complete, which is not expected prior to 2034. In 2004, the co-owners of Trojan (PGE, Eugene Water & Electric Board, and PacifiCorp, collectively referred to as Plaintiffs) filed a complaint against the USDOE for failure to accept spent nuclear fuel by January 31, 1998. PGE, which holds a 67.5% ownership interest in Trojan, had contracted with the USDOE for the permanent disposal of 92 Table of Contents PORTLAND GENERAL ELECTRIC COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, continued spent nuclear fuel in order to allow the final decommissioning of Trojan. The Plaintiffs paid for permanent disposal services during the period of plant operation and have met all other conditions precedent. The Plaintiffs sought reimbursement for damages incurred through 2009. A trial before the U.S. Court of Federal Claims concluded in 2012, with the Court issuing a judgment awarding certain damages to the Plaintiffs. The settlement agreement also provides for a process to submit claims for allowable costs for the periods subsequent to 2009, including an extension to cover costs through 2019. Pursuant to this process, the USDOE has reimbursed the Plaintiffs $85 million for costs incurred through 2016 resulting from USDOE delays in accepting spent nuclear fuel. PGE has received proceeds of $53 million related to its share in this legal matter. The settlement amounts received were recorded as a regulatory liability to offset amounts previously collected in relation to Trojan decommissioning activities. In December 2014, the OPUC issued an order on the Company's 2015 GRC, authorizing the return of $50 million of the proceeds received related to this legal matter to customers over a three-year period beginning January 1, 2015. PGE will return the remaining $3 million to customers in 2018. The ARO related to Trojan decommissioning activities was not impacted by the outcome of this legal matter because the proceeds received in connection with the settlement of this legal matter were for past Trojan decommissioning costs and this ARO reflects future Trojan decommissioning costs. Utility plant represents AROs that have been recognized for the Company's thermal and wind generation sites, distribution and transmission assets, the disposal of which is governed by environmental regulation. During 2017, the Company recorded an overall increase in AROs, including Trojan, of $6 million, with the change comprised of an increase to revisions in estimated cash flows and incurred liabilities of $2 million, accretion of $7 million, and a reduction of $3 million due to settled liabilities. In 2015, the Company recorded an increase to the Colstrip ARO in the amount of $17 million, as Colstrip utilizes wet scrubbers and a number of settlement ponds that will require upgrading or closure to meet new EPA regulatory requirements. PGE plans to seek recovery in customer prices of the incremental costs associated with the final EPA rules. Non-utility property primarily represents AROs which have been recognized for portions of unregulated properties leased to third parties. The following is a summary of the changes in the Company's AROs (in millions): Years Ended December 31,   2017   2016   2015 Balance as of beginning of year $ 161     $ 151     $ 116   Liabilities incurred 2     1     2   Liabilities settled (3 )   (3 )   (4 ) Accretion expense 7     7     7   Revisions in estimated cash flows  -      5     30   Balance as of end of year $ 167     $ 161     $ 151 Pursuant to regulation, the amortization of utility plant AROs is included in depreciation expense and in customer prices. Any differences in the timing of recognition of costs for financial reporting and ratemaking purposes are deferred as a regulatory asset or regulatory liability. Recovery of Trojan decommissioning costs is included in PGE's retail prices, approximately $4 million annually, with an equal amount recorded in Depreciation and amortization expense. 93 Table of Contents PORTLAND GENERAL ELECTRIC COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, continued PGE maintains a separate trust account, Nuclear decommissioning trust in the consolidated balance sheet, for funds collected from customers through prices to cover the cost of Trojan decommissioning activities. See ""Trust Accounts"" in Note 3, Balance Sheet Components, for additional information on the Nuclear decommissioning trust. The Oak Grove hydro facility and transmission and distribution plant located on public right-of-ways and on certain easements meet the requirements of a legal obligation and will require removal when the plant is no longer in service. An ARO liability is not currently measurable as management believes that these assets will be used in utility operations for the foreseeable future. Removal costs are charged to accumulated asset retirement removal costs, which is included in Regulatory liabilities on PGE's consolidated balance sheets. NOTE 8: CREDIT FACILITIES As of December 31, 2017, PGE had a $500 million revolving credit facility scheduled to expire in November 2021. Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, the revolving credit facility may be used for general corporate purposes, as backup for commercial paper borrowings, and to permit the issuance of standby letters of credit. PGE may borrow for one, two, three, or six months at a fixed interest rate established at the time of the borrowing, or at a variable interest rate for any period up to the then remaining term of the applicable credit facility. The revolving credit facility requires annual fees based on PGE's unsecured credit ratings, and contains customary covenants and default provisions, including a requirement that limits consolidated indebtedness, as defined in the agreement, to 65.0% of total capitalization. As of December 31, 2017, PGE was in compliance with this covenant with a 51.8% debt to total capital ratio. The Company has a commercial paper program under which it may issue commercial paper for terms of up to 270 days, limited to the unused amount of credit under the revolving credit facility. PGE classifies any borrowings under the revolving credit facility and outstanding commercial paper as Short-term debt in the consolidated balance sheets. PGE had no borrowings outstanding and there was no commercial paper or letters of credit issued under the revolving credit facility as of December 31, 2017. As a result, as of December 31, 2017, the aggregate unused available credit capacity under the revolving credit facility was $500 million. In addition, PGE has four letter of credit facilities that provide capacity up to a total of $220 million under which the Company can request letters of credit for original terms not to exceed one year. The issuance of such letters of credit is subject to the approval of the issuing institution. Under these facilities, $67 million of letters of credit was outstanding, as of December 31, 2017. Pursuant to an order issued by the FERC, the Company is authorized to issue short-term debt in an aggregate amount up to $900 million through February 6, 2020. Short-term borrowings under these credit facilities and related interest rates are reflected in the following table (dollars in millions). The Company had no short-term borrowings during 2017.

In 2017, the Company issued a total of $225 million at an interest rate of 3.98%. PGE drew $75 million in August with a maturity of 2048 and drew the remaining $150 million in November with a maturity of 2047. The Indenture securing PGE's outstanding FMBs constitutes a direct first mortgage lien on substantially all regulated utility property, other than expressly excepted property. Interest is payable semi-annually on FMBs. In 2017, PGE repaid an unsecured credit agreement under which it had borrowed $150 million from certain financial institutions. PGE repaid the loan in three separate payments as follows:  $50 million on August 21, 2017;  $25 million on October 30, 2017; and  $75 million on November 27, 2017. The term loan interest rates were set at the beginning of the interest period for periods of 1-month, 3-months, or 6-months, as selected by PGE and are based on the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus 63 basis points. The final rate was 1.87% as of November 27, 2017, with no other fees. Pollution Control Revenue Bonds - The Company has the option to remarket through 2033 the $21 million of Pollution Control Revenue Bonds (PCBs) held by PGE as of December 31, 2017. At the time of any remarketing, the Company can choose a new interest rate period that could be daily, weekly, or a fixed term. The new interest rate would be based on market conditions at the time of remarketing. The PCBs could be backed by FMBs or a bank letter of credit depending on market conditions. Interest is payable semi-annually on PCBs. 95 Table of Contents PORTLAND GENERAL ELECTRIC COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, continued As of December 31, 2017, the future minimum principal payments on long-term debt are as follows (in millions): Years ending December 31:     2018   $  -    2019   300   2020    -    2021   160   2022    -    Thereafter   1,976       $ 2,436 NOTE 10: EMPLOYEE BENEFITS Pension and Other Postretirement Plans Defined Benefit Pension Plan - PGE sponsors a non-contributory defined benefit pension plan, which has been closed to most new employees since January 31, 2009 and to all new employees since January 1, 2012. No changes were made to the benefits provided to existing participants when the plan was closed to new employees. The assets of the pension plan are held in a trust and are comprised of equity and debt instruments, all of which are recorded at fair value. Pension plan calculations include several assumptions that are reviewed annually and updated as appropriate, with the measurement date of December 31. PGE contributed $2 million to the pension plan in 2017, and made no contributions in 2016 or 2015. PGE expects to contribute $21 million to the pension plan in 2018. Other Postretirement Benefits - PGE has non-contributory postretirement health and life insurance plans, as well as health reimbursement arrangements (HRAs) for its employees (collectively, ""Other Postretirement Benefits"" in the following tables). Participants are covered under a Defined Dollar Medical Benefit Plan, which limits PGE's obligation pursuant to the postretirement health plan by establishing a maximum benefit per employee with employees responsible for the additional cost. The assets of these plans are held in voluntary employees' beneficiary association trusts and are comprised of money market funds, common stocks, common and collective trust funds, partnerships/joint ventures, and registered investment companies, all of which are recorded at fair value. Postretirement health and life insurance benefit plan calculations include several assumptions that are reviewed annually by PGE and updated as appropriate, with measurement dates of December 31. Non-Qualified Benefit Plan - The NQBP in the following tables include obligations for a Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan and a directors pension plan, both of which were closed to new participants in 1997. The NQBP also includes pension make-up benefits for employees that participate in the unfunded Management Deferred Compensation Plan (MDCP). Investments in the NQBP trust, consisting of trust-owned life insurance policies and marketable securities, provide funding for the future requirements of these plans. The assets of such trust are included in the accompanying tables for informational purposes only and are not considered segregated and restricted under current accounting standards. The investments in marketable securities, consisting of money market, bond, and equity mutual funds, are classified as trading and recorded at fair value. The measurement date for the NQBP is December 31. Other NQBP - In addition to the NQBP discussed above, PGE provides certain employees and outside directors with deferred compensation plans, whereby participants may defer a portion of their earned compensation. These 96 Table of Contents PORTLAND GENERAL ELECTRIC COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, continued unfunded plans include the MDCP and the Outside Directors' Deferred Compensation Plan. PGE holds investments in a NQBP trust that are intended to be a funding source for these plans. Trust assets and plan liabilities related to the NQBP included in PGE's consolidated balance sheets are as follows as of December 31 (in millions): 2017   2016    NQBP   Other NQBP   Total   NQBP   Other NQBP   Total Non-qualified benefit plan trust $ 17     $ 20     $ 37     $ 16     $ 18     $ 34   Non-qualified benefit plan liabilities * 25     81     106     25     80     105 * For the NQBP, excludes the current portion of $2 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively, which are classified in Other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. See ""Trust Accounts"" in Note 3, Balance Sheet Components, for information on the NQBP trust. Investment Policy and Asset Allocation - The Board of Directors of PGE appoints an Investment Committee, which is comprised of certain members of management from the Company, and establishes the Company's asset allocation. The Investment Committee is then responsible for implementation of the asset allocation and oversight of the benefit plan investments. The Company's investment policy for its pension and other postretirement plans is to balance risk and return through a diversified portfolio of equity securities, fixed income securities, and other alternative investments. Asset classes are regularly rebalanced to ensure asset allocations remain within prescribed parameters. 97 Table of Contents PORTLAND GENERAL ELECTRIC COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, continued The asset allocations for the plans, and the target allocation, are as follows: As of December 31,    2017   2016   Actual   Target *   Actual   Target * Defined Benefit Pension Plan:               Equity securities 68 %   67 %   68 %   67 % Debt securities 32     33     32     33   Total 100 %   100 %   100 %   100 % Other Postretirement Benefit Plans:               Equity securities 63 %   62 %   60 %   62 % Debt securities 37     38     40     38   Total 100 %   100 %   100 %   100 % Non-Qualified Benefits Plans:               Equity securities 18 %   12 %   15 %   11 % Debt securities 6     12     7     11   Insurance contracts 76     76     78     78   Total 100 %   100 %   100 %   100 % * The target for the Defined Benefit Pension Plan represents the mid-point of the investment target range. Due to the nature of the investment vehicles in both the Other Postretirement Benefit Plans and the NQBP, these targets are the weighted average of the mid-point of the respective investment target ranges approved by the Investment Committee. Due to the method used to calculate the weighted average targets for the Other Postretirement Benefit Plans and NQBP, reported percentages are affected by the fair market values of the investments within the pools. The Company's overall investment strategy is to meet the goals and objectives of the individual plans through a wide diversification of asset types, fund strategies, and fund managers. Equity securities primarily include investments across the capitalization ranges and style biases, both domestically and internationally. Fixed income securities include, but are not limited to, corporate bonds of companies from diversified industries, mortgage-backed securities, and U.S. Treasuries. Other types of investments include investments in hedge funds and private equity funds that follow several different strategies. Assets measured at fair value using net asset value (NAV) as a practical expedient are not categorized in the fair value hierarchy.

An overview of the identification of Level 1, 2, and 3 financial instruments is provided in Note 4, Fair Value of Financial Instruments. The following discussion provides information regarding the methods used in valuation of the various asset class investments held in the pension and other postretirement benefit plan trusts. Money market funds - PGE invests in money market funds that seek to maintain a stable net asset value. These funds invest in high-quality, short-term, diversified money market instruments, short-term treasury bills, federal 99 Table of Contents PORTLAND GENERAL ELECTRIC COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, continued agency securities, or certificates of deposit. Some of the money market funds held in the trusts are classified as Level 1 instruments as pricing inputs are based on unadjusted prices in an active market. The remaining money market funds are valued at NAV as a practical expedient and are not classified in the fair value hierarchy. Equity securities - Equity mutual fund and common stock securities are classified as Level 1 securities as pricing inputs are based on unadjusted prices in an active market. Principal markets for equity prices include published exchanges such as NASDAQ and NYSE.

Amounts related to the pension and other postretirement benefits are offset with the amortization of the corresponding regulatory asset. The following table summarizes the benefits expected to be paid to participants in each of the next five years and in the aggregate for the five years thereafter (in millions): Payments Due    2018   2019   2020   2021   2022   2023 - 2026 Defined benefit pension plan $ 39     $ 41     $ 42     $ 43     $ 44     $ 234   Other postretirement benefits 5     5     5     4     5     22   Non-qualified benefit plans 2     3     2     2     2     10   Total $ 46     $ 49     $ 49     $ 49     $ 51     $ 266 102 Table of Contents PORTLAND GENERAL ELECTRIC COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, continued All of the plans develop expected long-term rates of return for the major asset classes using long-term historical returns, with adjustments based on current levels and forecasts of inflation, interest rates, and economic growth. Also included are incremental rates of return provided by investment managers whose returns are expected to be greater than the markets in which they invest. For measurement purposes, the assumed health care cost trend rates, which can affect amounts reported for the health care plans, were as follows:  For 2017, 6.5% annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits was assumed for 2018, decreasing to 6.0% in 2019, then decreasing 0.25% per year thereafter, reaching 5.0% in 2023;  For 2016, 7% annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits was assumed for 2017, decreasing to 6.5% in 2018, then decreasing 0.25% per year thereafter, reaching 5.0% in 2023; and  For 2015, 6.5% annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits was assumed for 2016, decreasing to 6.0% in 2017, then decreasing 0.25% per year thereafter, reaching 5.0% in 2021. A one percentage point increase or decrease in the above health care cost assumption would have no material impact on total service or interest cost, or on the postretirement benefit obligation. 401(k) Retirement Savings Plan PGE sponsors a 401(k) Plan that covers substantially all employees. For eligible employees who are covered by PGE's defined benefit pension plan, the Company matches employee contributions up to 6% of the employee's base pay. For eligible employees who are not covered by PGE's defined benefit pension plan, the Company contributes 5% of the employee's base salary, whether or not the employee contributes to the 401(k) Plan, and also matches employee contributions up to 5% of the employee's base pay. For the majority of bargaining employees who are subject to the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 125 agreements the Company contributes an additional 1% of the employee's base salary, whether or not the employee contributes to the 401(k) Plan. All contributions are invested in accordance with employees' elections, limited to investment options available under the 401(k) Plan. PGE made contributions to employee accounts of $21 million in 2017, $19 million in 2016, and $17 million in 2015. NOTE 11: INCOME TAXES On December 22, 2017, the TCJA was enacted and signed into law by the President of the United States with substantially all of the provisions of the TCJA having an effective date of January 1, 2018. Among other provisions, the reduction of the federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, which required the Company to remeasure its existing deferred income tax balances as of December 31, 2017, had the most impact on PGE's financial condition. As a result of the Company's remeasurement, net deferred tax liabilities on the Company's consolidated balance sheets were reduced by $340 million. Of the remeasurement amount, $357 million has been deferred as a regulatory liability and is expected to be refunded to customers over time. These deferred tax items relate primarily to Electric utility plant and other rate base items subject to tax normalization rules that require the benefits to be passed on to customers through future prices over the remaining useful life of the underlying assets for which the deferred income taxes relate. The Company plans to use the average rate assumption method to account for the refund to customers. A portion of the remeasurement is not subject to tax normalization rules and will be amortized over time. 103 Table of Contents PORTLAND GENERAL ELECTRIC COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, continued The remaining and offsetting remeasurement amount of $17 million represents a reduction to net deferred tax assets related to other business items, primarily comprised of deferred tax assets related to the Company's NQBPs. The Company has recorded a $17 million charge to the results of operations, reflected as an increase in Income tax expense in the Company's consolidated statements of income for the period ended December 31, 2017. Based on the Company's interpretations of the TCJA as of December 31, 2017, PGE believes it has substantially completed its analysis of the tax effects of the TCJA and has reflected such effects in the remeasurement amounts recorded. However, PGE has not yet finalized its federal tax returns for 2017 and also expects regulatory bodies, such as the U.S. Department of the Treasury, Internal Revenue Service, and OPUC to issue additional guidance or orders in 2018 that may result in changes to the Company's previously finalized analysis of the TCJA. Such changes could result in material changes to the ultimate impact of the TCJA on PGE's financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. Income tax expense consists of the following (in millions): Years Ended December 31,    2017   2016   2015 Current:           Federal $ 4     $ 10     $ 4   State and local 12     3     1     16     13     5   Deferred:           Federal 61     23     26   State and local 9     14     14     70     37     40   Income tax expense $ 86     $ 50     $ 45 The significant differences between the U.S. federal statutory rate and PGE's effective tax rate for financial reporting purposes are as follows: Years Ended December 31,    2017   2016   2015 Federal statutory tax rate 35.0  %   35.0  %   35.0  % Federal tax credits(1) (14.0 )   (18.2 )   (19.0 ) Change in federal tax law(2) 6.1      -       -    State and local taxes, net of federal tax benefit 5.0     4.8     4.2   Flow through depreciation and cost basis differences 1.5     0.2      -    Other (2.1 )   (1.2 )   0.5   Effective tax rate 31.5  %   20.6  %   20.7  % (1) Federal tax credits consist primarily of production tax credits (PTCs) earned from Company-owned wind-powered generating facilities. The federal PTCs are earned based on a per-kilowatt hour rate, and as a result, the annual amount of PTCs earned will vary based on weather conditions and availability of the facilities. The PTCs are generated for 10 years from the corresponding facilities' in service dates. PGE's PTC generation ends at various dates between 2017 and 2024. (2) Includes a $17 million increase to Income tax expense related to the remeasurement of deferred income taxes as a result of the enacted tax rate change under the TCJA. 104 Table of Contents PORTLAND GENERAL ELECTRIC COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, continued Deferred income tax assets and liabilities consist of the following (in millions): As of December 31,      2017   2016 Deferred income tax assets:       Employee benefits $ 128     $ 181   Price risk management 56     59   Regulatory liabilities 14     29   Tax credits 50     56   Other 4     5   Total deferred income tax assets 252     330   Deferred income tax liabilities:       Depreciation and amortization 496     829   Regulatory assets 132     170   Other  -       -    Total deferred income tax liabilities 628     999   Deferred income tax liability, net $ (376 )   $ (669 ) As of December 31, 2017, PGE has federal credit carryforwards of $50 million, consisting of PTCs, which will expire at various dates through 2037. PGE has analyzed the provisions of the TCJA and its effects on the Company's deferred income tax assets, and PGE believes that it is more likely than not that its deferred income tax assets as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 will be realized; accordingly, no valuation allowance has been recorded. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, PGE had no unrecognized tax benefits. PGE and its subsidiaries file a consolidated federal income tax return. The Company also files income tax returns in the states of Oregon, California, and Montana, and in certain local jurisdictions. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has completed its examination of all tax years through 2010 and all issues were resolved related to those years. The Company does not believe that any open tax years for federal or state income taxes could result in any adjustments that would be significant to the consolidated financial statements. NOTE 12: EQUITY-BASED PLANS Employee Stock Purchase Plan PGE has an employee stock purchase plan (ESPP) under which a total of 625,000 shares of the Company's common stock may be issued. The ESPP permits all eligible employees to purchase shares of PGE common stock through regular payroll deductions, which are limited to 10% of base pay. Each year, employees may purchase up to a maximum of $25,000 in common stock (based on fair value on the purchase date) or 1,500 shares, whichever is less. Two, six-month offering periods occur annually, January 1 through June 30 and July 1 through December 31, during which eligible employees may contribute toward the purchase of shares of PGE common stock. Purchases occur the last day of the offering period, at a price equal to 95% of the fair value of the stock on the purchase date. As of December 31, 2017, there were 339,542 shares available for future issuance pursuant to the ESPP. Dividend Reinvestment and Direct Stock Purchase Plan PGE has a Dividend Reinvestment and Direct Stock Purchase Plan (DRIP), under which a total of 2,500,000 shares of the Company's common stock may be issued. Under the DRIP, investors may elect to buy shares of the Company's common stock or elect to reinvest cash dividends in additional shares of the Company's common stock. As of December 31, 2017, there were 2,470,052 shares available for future issuance pursuant to the DRIP. 105 Table of Contents PORTLAND GENERAL ELECTRIC COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, continued Equity Forward Sale Agreement PGE entered into an equity forward sale agreement (EFSA) in connection with a public offering of 11,100,000 shares of its common stock in June 2013. In 2013, the Company issued 700,000 shares of its common stock pursuant to the EFSA for net proceeds of $20 million. During the second quarter 2015, PGE physically settled in full the EFSA by issuing 10,400,000 shares of common PGE common stock in exchange for cash of $271 million. Prior to settlement, the potentially issuable shares pursuant to the EFSA were reflected in PGE's diluted earnings per share calculations using the treasury stock method. Under this method, the number of shares of PGE's common stock used in calculating diluted earnings per share for a reporting period were increased by the number of shares, if any, that would be issued upon physical settlement of the EFSA less the number of shares that could have been purchased by PGE in the market with the proceeds received from issuance (based on the average market price during that reporting period). NOTE 13: STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE Pursuant to the Portland General Electric Company 2006 Stock Incentive Plan (the Plan), the Company may grant a variety of equity-based awards, including restricted stock units (RSUs) with time-based vesting conditions (time-based RSUs) and performance-based vesting conditions (performance-based RSUs), to non-employee directors, officers, or certain key employees. Service requirements generally must be met for RSUs to vest. For each grant, the number of RSUs is determined by dividing the specified award amount for each grantee by the closing stock price on the date of grant. RSU activity is summarized in the following table: Units   Weighted Average Grant Date Fair Value Outstanding as of December 31, 2014 463,893     $ 28.96   Granted 181,797     34.77   Forfeited (14,988 )   34.10   Vested (187,709 )   25.82   Outstanding as of December 31, 2015 442,993     32.84   Granted 193,734     35.89   Forfeited (3,044 )   28.62   Vested (174,891 )   31.47   Outstanding as of December 31, 2016 458,792     34.68   Granted 202,145     41.96   Forfeited (64,840 )   39.57   Vested (196,721 )   31.78   Outstanding as of December 31, 2017 399,376     37.98 A total of 4,687,500 shares of common stock were registered for issuance under the Plan, of which 3,229,476 shares remain available for future issuance as of December 31, 2017. Outstanding RSUs provide for the payment of one Dividend Equivalent Right (DER) for each stock unit. DERs represent an amount equal to dividends paid to shareholders on a share of PGE's common stock and vest on the same schedule as the RSUs. The DERs are settled in cash (for grants to non-employee directors) or shares of PGE common stock valued either at the closing stock price on the vesting date (for performance-based RSUs) or dividend payment date (for all other grants). The cash from the settlement of the DERs for non-employee directors may be deferred under the terms of the Portland General Electric Company 2006 Outside Directors' Deferred Compensation Plan. Time-based RSUs vest in either equal installments over a one-year period on the last day of each calendar quarter, over a three-year period on each anniversary of the grant date, or at the end of a three-year period following the grant date. The fair value of time-based RSUs is measured based on the closing price of PGE common stock on the date of grant and charged to compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for the entire award. The total value of time-based RSUs vested was less than $1 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015. Performance-based RSUs vest if performance goals are met at the end of a three-year performance period. Grants are based on three equally-weighted metrics: i) return on equity relative to allowed return on equity; ii) regulated asset base growth (applicable only for those grants made prior to 2017); and iii) a relative total shareholder return (TSR) of PGE's common stock as compared to an index of peer companies during the performance period. Vesting of performance-based RSUs is calculated by multiplying the number of units granted by a performance percentage determined by the Compensation and Human Resources Committee of PGE's Board of Directors (Committee). The 106 Table of Contents PORTLAND GENERAL ELECTRIC COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, continued performance percentage is calculated based on the extent to which the performance goals are met. In accordance with the Plan, however, the Committee may disregard or offset the effect of extraordinary, unusual or non-recurring items in determining results relative to these goals. Based on the attainment of the performance goals, the awards can range from zero to 150% of the grant. For the return on equity and regulated asset base growth portions of the performance-based RSUs, fair value is measured based on the closing price of PGE common stock on the date of grant. For the TSR portion of the performance-based RSUs, fair value is determined using a Monte Carlo simulation model utilizing actual information for the common shares of PGE and its peer group for the period from the beginning of the performance period to the grant date and estimated future stock volatility over the remaining performance period. The fair value of stock-based compensation related to the TSR component of performance-based RSUs was determined using the Monte Carlo model and the following weighted average assumptions: 2017   2016 Risk-free interest rate     1.5 %       0.9 % Expected dividend yield      -  %        -  % Expected term (in years)     3.0         3.0   Volatility 15.6 % - 22.9 %   14.5 % - 25.9 % The fair value of performance-based RSUs is charged to compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for the entire award based on the number of shares expected to vest. Stock-based compensation expense was calculated assuming the attainment of performance goals that would allow the weighted average vesting of 107.0%, 120.8%, and 118.2% of awarded performance-based RSUs for the respective 2017, 2016, and 2015 grants, with an estimated 5% forfeiture rate. The total value of performance-based RSUs vested was $6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, $5 million for 2016, and $4 million for 2015. Stock-based compensation, included in Administrative and other expense in the consolidated statements of income, was $7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, and $6 million for 2016, and 2015. Such amounts differ from those reported in the consolidated statements of equity for Stock-based compensation due primarily to the impact from the income tax payments made on behalf of employees. The Company withholds a portion of the vested shares for the payment of income taxes on behalf of the employees. Not included in Administrative and other expenses in the consolidated statements of income, is the net impact from these income tax payments, partially offset by the issuance of DERs, resulting in a charge to equity of $3 million in 2017, and $2 million in 2016 and 2015. As of December 31, 2017, unrecognized stock-based compensation expense was $7 million, of which approximately $5 million and $2 million is expected to be expensed in 2018 and 2019, respectively. No stock-based compensation costs have been capitalized and the Plan had no material impact on cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, or 2015. NOTE 14: EARNINGS PER SHARE Basic earnings per share are computed based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the year. Diluted earnings per share are computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding and the effect of dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the year using the treasury stock method. Potential common shares consist of: i) employee stock purchase plan shares; ii) contingently issuable time-based and performance-based restricted stock units, along with associated dividend equivalent rights; and iii) shares issuable pursuant to the EFSA. During the second quarter of 2015, PGE physically settled in full the EFSA, with the issuance of 10,400,000 shares of common stock. Prior to settlement, the potentially issuable shares pursuant to the EFSA were reflected in PGE's diluted earnings per share calculations using the treasury stock method. See Note 12, Equity-based Plans, for additional information on the EFSA and its impact on earnings per share. Net income attributable to PGE common shareholders is the same for both the basic and diluted earnings per share computation. The reconciliations of the denominators of the basic and diluted earnings per share computations are as follows (in thousands): Years Ended December 31,   2017   2016   2015 Weighted average common shares outstanding - basic 89,056     88,896     84,180   Dilutive effect of potential common shares 120     158     161   Weighted average common shares outstanding - diluted 89,176     89,054     84,341 NOTE 15: COMMITMENTS AND GUARANTEES Purchase Commitments As of December 31, 2017, PGE's estimated future minimum payments pursuant to purchase obligations for the following five years and thereafter are as follows (in millions): Payments Due   2018   2019   2020   2021   2022   Thereafter   Total Capital and other purchase commitments $ 191     $ 2     $ 10     $ 2     $ 2     $ 58     $ 265   Purchased power and fuel:                           Electricity purchases 156     156     201     200     187     1,733     2,633   Capacity contracts 6     5     4     4     4     8     31   Public utility districts 9     17     16     16     15     85     158   Natural gas 51     35     28     25     24     140     303   Coal and transportation 15     5      -       -       -       -      20   Total $ 428     $ 220     $ 259     $ 247     $ 232     $ 2,024     $ 3,410 Capital and other purchase commitments - Certain commitments have been made for 2018 and beyond that include those related to hydro licenses, upgrades to generation, distribution, and transmission facilities, information systems, and system maintenance work. Termination of these agreements could result in cancellation charges. Electricity purchases and Capacity contracts - PGE has power purchase agreements with counterparties, which expire at varying dates through 2044, and power capacity contracts through 2024. Public utility districts - PGE has long-term power purchase agreements with certain public utility districts including, Grant County PUD for the Priest Rapids and Wanapum projects, and Douglas County PUD for the Wells 107 Table of Contents PORTLAND GENERAL ELECTRIC COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, continued project, in the state of Washington. Under the agreements, the Company is required to pay its proportionate share of the operating and debt service costs of the hydroelectric projects whether or not they are operable. In addition, although PGE's current agreement with Douglas County ends on August 31, 2018, a new contract becomes effective on September 1, 2018 that does not require contributions to Douglas County debt obligation or other costs, including the operation and maintenance costs of the projects. The new contract requires monthly payments for capacity that will not vary with annual project generation provided to PGE. The Company has estimated the capacity payments, which are subject to annual adjustments based on Douglas loads, and included the estimated amounts in the table above. The future minimum payments for the public utility districts in the preceding table reflect the principal and capacity payments only and do not include interest, operation, or maintenance expenses. Selected information regarding these projects is summarized as follows (dollars in millions): Revenue Bonds as of December 31, 2017   PGE's Share as of December 31, 2017   Contract Expiration   PGE Cost, including Debt Service   Output   Capacity     2017   2016   2015           (in MW)                 Priest Rapids and Wanapum $ 1,269     8.6 %   163     2052   $ 16     $ 16     $ 18   Wells 160     19.4     150     2018   11     10     10   Portland Hydro  -       -       -      2017   1     1     2 The agreements for Priest Rapids, Wanapum, and Wells provide that, should any other purchaser of output default on payments as a result of bankruptcy or insolvency, PGE would be allocated a pro rata share of the output and operating and debt service costs of the defaulting purchaser. For Wells, PGE would be allocated up to a cumulative maximum of 25% of the defaulting purchaser's percentage through August 2018, after which PGE would be responsible for a pro-rata portion of the defaulting purchaser's share with no limitation, regardless of the reason for any default. For Priest Rapids and Wanapum, PGE would be allocated up to a cumulative maximum that would not adversely affect the tax exempt status of any of the public utility district's outstanding debt for the portion of the project that benefits tax exempt purchasers. Natural gas - PGE has contracts for the purchase and transportation of natural gas from domestic and Canadian sources for its natural gas-fired generating facilities. The Company also has a natural gas storage agreement for the purpose of fueling the Company's Port Westward Unit 1 (PW1), PW2, and Beaver natural gas-fired generating plants. Coal and transportation - PGE has coal and related rail transportation agreements with take-or-pay provisions related to Boardman that expire at various dates through 2020. 108 Table of Contents PORTLAND GENERAL ELECTRIC COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, continued Lease Obligations As of December 31, 2017, PGE's estimated future minimum lease payments pursuant to capital, build-to-suit, and operating leases for the following five years and thereafter are as follows (in millions): Future Minimum Lease Payments   Capital Leases   Build-to-Suit   Operating Leases 2018 $ 7     $  -      $ 9   2019 6     15     8   2020 6     15     6   2021 6     14     6   2022 5     14     8   Thereafter 72     260     165   Total minimum lease payments $ 102     $ 318     $ 202   Less imputed interest 51           Present value of net minimum lease payments $ 51           Less current portion 2           Non-current portion $ 49 Capital Leases - PGE has entered into agreements to purchase natural gas transportation capacity to serve Carty via a 24-mile natural gas pipeline, Carty Lateral, that was constructed to serve the Carty facility. The Company has entered into a 30-year agreement to purchase the entire capacity of Carty Lateral, which is approximately 175,000 decatherms per day. At the end of the initial contract term, the Company has the option to renew the agreement in continuous three-year increments with at least 24-months prior written notice. As of December 31, 2017, a capital lease asset of $57 million was reflected within Electric utility plant and accumulated amortization of such assets of $6 million was reflected within Accumulated depreciation and amortization in the table above. The present value of the future minimum lease payments due under the agreement included $2 million within Accrued expenses and other current liabilities and $49 million in Other noncurrent liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. For ratemaking purposes capital leases are treated as operating leases; therefore, in accordance with the accounting rules for regulated operations, the amortization of the leased asset is based on the rental payments recovered from customers. Also for ratemaking purposes, such rental payments were capitalized to the Carty project prior to its in service date of July 29, 2016 and, as a result, amortization of the leased asset of $2 million and interest expense of $3 million was capitalized to CWIP. Beginning August 1, 2016, amortization of the leased asset of $1 million and interest expense of $2 million has been recorded to Purchased power and fuel expense in the consolidated statements of income through December 31, 2016. For the year ended December 31, 2017, amortization of the leased asset of $3 million and interest expense of $4 million has been recorded to Purchased power and fuel expense in the consolidated statements of income. Build-to-suit - PGE has entered into a 30-year lease agreement with a local natural gas company, NW Natural, to expand their current natural gas storage facilities, including the development of an underground storage reservoir and construction of a new compressor station and 13-mile pipeline, which will be designed to provide no-notice storage and transportation services to PGE's PW1, PW2, and Beaver natural gas-fired generating plants. Pursuant to the agreement, on September 30, 2016, PGE issued NW Natural a Notice To Proceed with construction of the expansion project, which the gas company estimates will be completed during the winter of 2018-2019, at a cost of approximately $132 million. Due to the level of PGE's involvement during the construction period, the Company is deemed to be the owner of the assets for accounting purposes during the construction period. As a result, PGE has recorded $108 million to CWIP and a corresponding liability for the same amount to Other noncurrent liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2017. In 2016, PGE recorded $21 million to CWIP and a corresponding liability for the same amount to Other noncurrent liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets as of 109 Table of Contents PORTLAND GENERAL ELECTRIC COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, continued December 31, 2016. Upon completion of the facility, PGE will assess whether the assets and liabilities qualify as a successful sale-leaseback transaction in which the asset and liability are removed and accounted for as either a capital or operating lease. The table above reflects PGE's estimated future minimum lease payments pursuant to the agreement based on estimated costs and assumes three 10-year renewable options are exercised. Operating leases - PGE has various operating leases associated with its headquarters and certain of its production, transmission, and support facilities that expire in various years, including the Port of St. Helens land lease, which expires in 2096 and covers the location of PW1, PW2, and Beaver. Rent expense was $9 million in 2017, and $10 million in 2016 and 2015. The future minimum operating lease payments presented is net of sublease income of $4 million in each of 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021; and $2 million in 2022. Sublease income was $4 million in 2017 and 2016, and $3 million in 2015. Guarantees PGE enters into financial agreements and power and natural gas purchase and sale agreements that include indemnification provisions relating to certain claims or liabilities that may arise relating to the transactions contemplated by these agreements. Generally, a maximum obligation is not explicitly stated in the indemnification provisions and, therefore, the overall maximum amount of the obligation under such indemnifications cannot be reasonably estimated. PGE periodically evaluates the likelihood of incurring costs under such indemnities based on the Company's historical experience and the evaluation of the specific indemnities. As of December 31, 2017, management believes the likelihood is remote that PGE would be required to perform under such indemnification provisions or otherwise incur any significant losses with respect to such indemnities. The Company has not recorded any liability on the consolidated balance sheets with respect to these indemnities. NOTE 16: JOINTLY-OWNED PLANT As of December 31, 2017, PGE had the following investments in jointly-owned plant (dollars in millions): PGE Share   In-service Date   Plant In-service   Accumulated Depreciation*   Construction Work In Progress Boardman 90.00 %   1980   $ 515     $ 426     $  -    Colstrip 20.00     1986   546     351     5   Pelton/Round Butte 66.67     1958 / 1964   251     68     7   Total             $ 1,312     $ 845     $ 12 * Excludes AROs and accumulated asset retirement removal costs. Under the respective joint operating agreements for the three generating facilities, each participating owner is responsible for financing its share of construction, operating, and leasing costs. PGE's proportionate share of direct operating and maintenance expenses of the facilities is included in the corresponding operating and maintenance expense categories in the consolidated statements of income. NOTE 17: CONTINGENCIES PGE is subject to legal, regulatory, and environmental proceedings, investigations, and claims that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of its business. Contingencies are evaluated using the best information available at the time the consolidated financial statements are prepared. Legal costs incurred in connection with loss contingencies are expensed as incurred. The Company may seek regulatory recovery of certain costs that are incurred in connection with such matters, although there can be no assurance that such recovery would be granted. 110 Table of Contents PORTLAND GENERAL ELECTRIC COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, continued Loss contingencies are accrued, and disclosed if material, when it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability incurred as of the financial statement date and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. If a reasonable estimate of probable loss cannot be determined, a range of loss may be established, in which case the minimum amount in the range is accrued, unless some other amount within the range appears to be a better estimate. A loss contingency will also be disclosed when it is reasonably possible that an asset has been impaired or a liability incurred if the estimate or range of potential loss is material. If a probable or reasonably possible loss cannot be reasonably estimated, then the Company i) discloses an estimate of such loss or the range of such loss, if the Company is able to determine such an estimate, or ii) discloses that an estimate cannot be made and the reasons. If an asset has been impaired or a liability incurred after the financial statement date, but prior to the issuance of the financial statements, the loss contingency is disclosed, if material, and the amount of any estimated loss is recorded in the subsequent reporting period. The Company evaluates, on a quarterly basis, developments in such matters that could affect the amount of any accrual, as well as the likelihood of developments that would make a loss contingency both probable and reasonably estimable. The assessment as to whether a loss is probable or reasonably possible, and as to whether such loss or a range of such loss is estimable, often involves a series of complex judgments about future events. Management is often unable to estimate a reasonably possible loss, or a range of loss, particularly in cases in which: i) the damages sought are indeterminate or the basis for the damages claimed is not clear; ii) the proceedings are in the early stages; iii) discovery is not complete; iv) the matters involve novel or unsettled legal theories; v) there are significant facts in dispute; vi) there are a large number of parties (including circumstances in which it is uncertain how liability, if any, will be shared among multiple defendants); or vii) there is a wide range of potential outcomes. In such cases, there is considerable uncertainty regarding the timing or ultimate resolution, including any possible loss, fine, penalty, or business impact. Carty In 2013, PGE entered into a turnkey engineering, procurement, and construction agreement (Construction Agreement) with Abeinsa EPC LLC, Abener Construction Services, LLC, Teyma Construction USA, LLC, and Abeinsa Abener Teyma General Partnership (collectively, the ""Contractor""), affiliates of Abengoa S.A. - for the construction of the Carty natural gas-fired generating plant (Carty) located in Eastern Oregon. Liberty Mutual Insurance Company and Zurich American Insurance Company (together, the ""Sureties"") provided a performance bond of $145.6 million (Performance Bond) in connection with the Construction Agreement. In December 2015, the Company declared the Contractor in default under the Construction Agreement and terminated the Construction Agreement. Following termination of the Construction Agreement, PGE brought on new contractors and construction resumed. Carty was placed into service on July 29, 2016 and the Company began collecting its revenue requirement in customer prices on August 1, 2016, as authorized by the OPUC, based on the approved capital cost of $514 million. Actual costs for the construction of Carty exceeded the approved amount and, as of December 31, 2017, PGE has capitalized $637 million to Electric utility plant. As the final construction cost exceeded the amount authorized by the OPUC, higher interest and depreciation expense than allowed in the Company's revenue requirement has resulted. These incremental expenses are recognized in the Company's current results of operations, as a deferral for such amounts would not be considered probable of recovery at this time, in accordance with GAAP. As actual project costs for Carty have exceeded $514 million, the Company has incurred a higher cost of service than what is reflected in the current authorized revenue requirement amount, primarily due to higher depreciation, 111 Table of Contents PORTLAND GENERAL ELECTRIC COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, continued interest expense and legal expenses. Such incremental expenses were $14 million and $3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Any amounts approved by the OPUC for recovery under the deferral filing would be recognized in earnings in the period of such approval. Actual costs do not reflect any offsetting amounts that may be received from the Sureties, pursuant to the Performance Bond. The amounts recorded also exclude $8 million of liens and claims filed for goods and services provided under contracts with the former Contractor that remain in dispute. The Company believes these liens and claims are invalid and is contesting the liens and claims in the courts. The incremental costs resulted from various matters relating to the resumption of construction activities following the termination of the Construction Agreement, including, among other things, completing the remaining construction work, correcting deficiencies and defects in work performed by the former Contractor, determining the remaining scope of construction, preparing work plans for contractors, identifying new contractors, negotiating contracts, and procuring additional materials. Other items contributing to the increase include costs relating to the removal of certain liens filed on the property for goods and services provided under contracts with the former Contractor, and costs to repair equipment damage that resulted from poor storage and maintenance on the part of the former Contractor. In July 2016, the Company requested from the OPUC a regulatory deferral for the recovery of the revenue requirement associated with the incremental capital costs for Carty starting from its in service date to the date that such amounts are approved in a subsequent regulatory proceeding. The Company has requested that the OPUC delay its review of this deferral request until all legal actions with respect to this matter, including PGE's actions against the Sureties, have been resolved. Any amounts approved by the OPUC for recovery under the deferral filing would be recognized in earnings in the period of such approval, however there is no assurance that such recovery would be granted by the OPUC. The Company believes that costs incurred to date and capitalized in Electric utility plant, net, in the condensed consolidated balance sheet, were prudently incurred. There have been no settlement discussions with regulators related to such costs. The Company is involved in several litigation proceedings concerning the termination of the Construction Agreement and the payment obligations of the Sureties. PGE is seeking recovery of incremental construction costs and other damages pursuant to breach of contract claims against the Contractor and claims against the Sureties pursuant to the Performance Bond. The Sureties have denied liability in whole under the Performance Bond. Various actions relating to this matter have been filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Oregon (U.S. District Court), in the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals (Ninth Circuit), and in an arbitration proceeding, including the following:  A breach of contract claim dated March 23, 2016, Portland General Electric Company v. Liberty Mutual Insurance Company and Zurich American Insurance Company, U.S. District Court of the District of Oregon, brought by PGE against the Sureties in U.S. District Court asserting that the Sureties are responsible for the payment of all damages sustained by PGE as a result of the Contractor's breach of contract. The Company's complaint disputes the Sureties' assertion that the Company wrongfully terminated the Construction Agreement and asserts that the Sureties are responsible for the payment of all damages sustained by PGE as a result of the Sureties' breach of contract, including damages in excess of the $145.6 million stated amount of the Performance Bond. Such damages include additional costs incurred by PGE to complete Carty. 112 Table of Contents PORTLAND GENERAL ELECTRIC COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, continued  A claim dated October 21, 2016, Portland General Electric Company v. Abeinsa EPC LLC, Abener Construction Services, LLC (formerly known as Abener Engineering and Construction Services, LLC), Teyma Construction USA LLC, and Abeinsa Abener Teyma General Partnership, U.S. District Court of the District of Oregon, brought by PGE in U.S. District Court against the Contractor for failure to satisfy its obligations under the Construction Agreement. PGE is seeking damages from the Contractor in excess of $200 million for: i) costs incurred to complete construction of Carty, settle claims with unpaid contractors and vendors, and remove liens; and ii) damages in excess of the construction costs, including a project management fee, liquidated damages under the Construction Agreement, legal fees and costs, damages due to delay of the project, warranty costs, and interest.  A claim dated December 31, 2015, In the Matter of an Arbitration Under the Rules of the International Chamber of Commerce's Court of Arbitration, International Chamber of Commerce's Court of Arbitration, by Abengoa S.A. in the ICC arbitration proceeding alleging that the Company's termination of the Construction Agreement was wrongful and in breach of the terms of the agreement and did not give rise to any liability of Abengoa S.A.; and  A claim by the Contractor against PGE in the ICC arbitration proceeding seeking damages of $117 million based on a claim that PGE wrongfully terminated the Construction Agreement and $44 million based on a claim that PGE failed to disclose certain information to the Contractor, in connection with the Contractor's bid submitted pursuant to the Company's request for proposals. Following various procedural arguments in the ICC arbitration and the U.S. District Court, in July 2017, the Ninth Circuit held that the ICC arbitral tribunal had jurisdiction to determine what parties and what claims could be presented in the ICC arbitration as opposed to in court. A hearing before the ICC arbitral tribunal is expected to take place on April 9 and 10, 2018. The decision of the ICC arbitral tribunal is expected to determine the forum in which the above referenced claims will be heard. After exhausting all remedies against the aforementioned parties, the Company intends to seek approval to recover any remaining excess amounts in customer prices in a subsequent regulatory proceeding. However, there is no assurance that such recovery would be allowed by the OPUC. In accordance with GAAP and the Company's accounting policies, any such excess costs may be charged to expense at the time disallowance of recovery becomes probable and a reasonable estimate of the amount of such disallowance can be made. As of the date of this report, the Company has concluded that the likelihood is less than probable that a portion of the cost of Carty will be disallowed for recovery in customer prices. Accordingly, no loss has been recorded to date related to the project. EPA Investigation of Portland Harbor An investigation by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) that began in 1997 of a segment of the Willamette River known as Portland Harbor has revealed significant contamination of river sediments. The EPA subsequently included Portland Harbor on the National Priority List pursuant to the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act as a federal Superfund site and listed 69 Potentially Responsible Parties (PRPs). PGE was included among the PRPs as it has historically owned or operated property near the river. In 2008, the EPA requested information from various parties, including PGE, concerning additional properties in or near the original segment of the river under investigation as well as several miles beyond. Subsequently, the EPA has listed additional PRPs, which now number over one hundred. The Portland Harbor site remedial investigation had been completed pursuant to an agreement between the EPA and several PRPs known as the Lower Willamette Group (LWG), which did not include PGE. The LWG funded the remedial investigation and feasibility study and stated that it had incurred $115 million in investigation-related costs. The Company anticipates that such costs will ultimately be allocated to PRPs as a part of the allocation process for remediation costs of the EPA's preferred remedy. 113 Table of Contents PORTLAND GENERAL ELECTRIC COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, continued The EPA has finalized the feasibility study, along with the remedial investigation, and the results provided the framework for the EPA to determine a clean-up remedy for Portland Harbor that was documented in a Record of Decision (ROD) issued on January 6, 2017. The ROD outlines the EPA's selected remediation plan to clean-up for Portland Harbor, which has an estimated total cost of $1.7 billion, comprised of $1.2 billion related to remediation construction costs and $0.5 billion related to long-term operation and maintenance costs, for a combined discounted present value of $1.1 billion. Remediation construction costs are estimated to be incurred over a 13-year period, with long-term operation and maintenance costs estimated to be incurred over a 30-year period from the start of construction. The EPA acknowledges the estimated costs are based on data that is now outdated and that a period of pre-remedial design sampling is necessary to gather updated baseline data to better refine the remedial design and estimated cost. In December 2017, the EPA announced that four PRPs have entered into an administrative order on consent to conduct this additional sampling, which is estimated to be completed in two years. PGE is not among the four PRPs performing this sampling. PGE is participating in a voluntary process to determine an appropriate allocation of costs amongst the PRPs.  Significant uncertainties remain surrounding facts and circumstances that are integral to the determination of such an allocation percentage, including results of the pre-remedial design sampling, a final allocation methodology and data with regard to property specific activities and history of ownership of sites within Portland Harbor. Based on the above facts and remaining uncertainties, PGE cannot reasonably estimate its potential liability or determine an allocation percentage that represents PGE's portion of the liability to clean-up Portland Harbor. Where injuries to natural resources have occurred as a result of releases of hazardous substances, federal and state natural resource trustees may seek to recover for damages at such sites, which are referred to as natural resource damages. As it relates to the Portland Harbor, PGE has been participating in the Portland Harbor Natural Resource Damages assessment (NRDA) process. The EPA does not manage NRDA activities, but provides claims information and coordination support to the Natural Resource Damages (NRD) trustees. Damage assessment activities are typically conducted by a Trustee Council made up of the trustee entities for the site. The Portland Harbor NRD trustees are the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the State of Oregon, and certain tribal entities. The NRD trustees may seek to negotiate legal settlements or take other legal actions against the parties responsible for the damages. Funds from such settlements must be used to restore injured resources and may also compensate the trustees for costs incurred in assessing the damages. The NRD trustees are in the process of negotiating NRDA liability with several PRPs, including PGE. The Company believes that PGE's portion of NRDA liabilities related to Portland Harbor will not have a material impact on its results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. As discussed above, significant uncertainties still remain concerning the precise boundaries for clean-up, the assignment of responsibility for clean-up costs, the final selection of a proposed remedy by the EPA, the amount of natural resource damages, and the method of allocation of costs amongst PRPs. It is probable that PGE will share in a portion of these costs. However, the Company does not currently have sufficient information to reasonably estimate the amount, or range, of its potential costs for investigation or remediation of the Portland Harbor site, although such costs could be material. The Company plans to seek recovery of any costs resulting from the Portland Harbor proceeding through claims under insurance policies and regulatory recovery in customer prices. In July 2016, the Company filed a deferral application with the OPUC seeking the deferral of the future environmental remediation costs, as well as, seeking authorization to establish a regulatory cost recovery mechanism for such environmental costs. The Company reached an agreement with OPUC Staff and other parties regarding the details of the recovery mechanism, which the OPUC approved in the first quarter of 2017. The mechanism will allow the Company to defer and recover incurred environmental expenditures through a combination of third-party proceeds, such as insurance recoveries, and through customer prices, as necessary. The mechanism establishes annual prudency reviews of environmental expenditures and is subject to an annual earnings test. 114 Table of Contents PORTLAND GENERAL ELECTRIC COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, continued Trojan Investment Recovery Class Actions In 1993, PGE closed the Trojan nuclear power plant (Trojan) and sought full recovery of, and a rate of return on, its Trojan costs in a general rate case filing with the OPUC. In 1995, the OPUC issued a general rate order that granted the Company recovery of, and a rate of return on, 87% of its remaining investment in Trojan. Numerous challenges and appeals were subsequently filed in various state courts on the issue of the OPUC's authority under Oregon law to grant recovery of, and a return on, the Trojan investment. In 2007, following several appeals by various parties, the Oregon Court of Appeals issued an opinion that remanded the matter to the OPUC for reconsideration. In 2003, in two separate legal proceedings, lawsuits were filed against PGE on behalf of two classes of electric service customers: Dreyer, Gearhart and Kafoury Bros., LLC v. Portland General Electric Company, Marion County Circuit Court; and Morgan v. Portland General Electric Company, Marion County Circuit Court. The class action lawsuits seek damages totaling $260 million, plus interest, as a result of the Company's inclusion, in prices charged to customers, of a return on its investment in Trojan. In August 2006, the Oregon Supreme Court (OSC) issued a ruling ordering the abatement of the class action proceedings. The OSC concluded that the OPUC had primary jurisdiction to determine what, if any, remedy could be offered to PGE customers, through price reductions or refunds, for any amount of return on the Trojan investment that the Company collected in prices. In 2008, the OPUC issued an order (2008 Order) that required PGE to provide refunds of $33 million, including interest, which were completed in 2010. Following appeals, the 2008 Order was upheld by the Oregon Court of Appeals in February 2013 and by the OSC in October 2014. In June 2015, based on a motion filed by PGE, the Marion County Circuit Court (Circuit Court) lifted the abatement and in July 2015, the Circuit Court heard oral argument on the Company's motion for Summary Judgment. In March 2016, the Circuit Court entered a general judgment that granted the Company's motion for Summary Judgment and dismissed all claims by the plaintiffs. On April 14, 2016, the plaintiffs appealed the Circuit Court dismissal to the Court of Appeals for the State of Oregon. Briefing on the appeal is now complete, with a Court of Appeals decision pending. PGE believes that the October 2, 2014 OSC decision and the recent Circuit Court decisions have reduced the risk of a loss to the Company in excess of the amounts previously recorded and discussed above. However, because the class actions remain subject to a decision in the appeal, management believes that it is reasonably possible that such a loss to the Company could result. As these matters involve unsettled legal theories and have a broad range of potential outcomes, sufficient information is currently not available to determine the amount of any such loss. Deschutes River Alliance Clean Water Act Claims On August 12, 2016, the Deschutes River Alliance (DRA) filed a lawsuit against the Company, Deschutes River Alliance v. Portland General Electric Company, U.S. District Court of the District of Oregon, which seeks injunctive and declaratory relief against PGE under the Clean Water Act (CWA) related to alleged past and continuing violations of the CWA. Specifically, DRA claims PGE has violated certain conditions contained in PGE's Water Quality Certification for the Pelton/Round Butte Hydroelectric Project (Project) related to dissolved oxygen, temperature, and measures of acidity or alkalinity of the water. DRA alleges the violations are related to PGE's operation of the Selective Water Withdrawal (SWW) facility at the Project. The SWW, located above Round Butte Dam, is, among other things, designed to blend water from the surface of the reservoir with water near the bottom of the reservoir and was constructed and placed into service in 2010, as part of 115 Table of Contents PORTLAND GENERAL ELECTRIC COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, continued the FERC license requirements for the purpose of restoration and enhancement of native salmon and steelhead fisheries above the Project. DRA has alleged that PGE's operation of the SWW has caused the above-referenced violations of the CWA, which in turn have degraded the Deschutes River's fish and wildlife habitat below the Project and harmed the economic and personal interests of DRA's members and supporters. In September 2016, PGE filed a motion to dismiss, which asserted that the CWA does not allow citizen suits of this nature, and that the FERC has jurisdiction over all licensing issues, including the alleged CWA violations. On March 27, 2017, the court denied PGE's motion to dismiss. On April 6, 2017, PGE filed a motion with the District Court for certification to file an interlocutory appeal with the Ninth Circuit and for a stay of the District Court proceeding. The District Court granted PGE's request on May 19, 2017, but the Ninth Circuit denied the appeal on August 14, 2017. On April 7, 2017, the District Court granted an unopposed motion filed by the Confederated Tribes of Warm Springs (the Tribes) to appear in the case as a friend of the court. The Tribes share ownership of the Project with PGE, but have not been named as a defendant. Following conferences and negotiations involving various parties, and with the expiration of the stay, the District Court Judge, on January 17, 2018, established a briefing schedule for summary judgment motions. The Company cannot predict the outcome of this matter, but believes that it has strong defenses to DRA's claims and intends to defend against them. Because i) this matter involves novel issues of law and ii) the mechanism and costs for achieving the relief sought in DRA's claims have not yet been determined, the Company cannot, at this time, determine the likelihood of whether the outcome of this matter will result in a material loss. Other Matters PGE is subject to other regulatory, environmental, and legal proceedings, investigations, and claims that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of business, which may result in judgments against the Company. Although management currently believes that resolution of such matters, individually and in the aggregate, will not have a material impact on its financial position, results of operations, or cash flows, these matters are subject to inherent uncertainties, and management's view of these matters may change in the future. 116 Table of Contents QUARTERLY FINANCIAL DATA (Unaudited) Quarter Ended    March 31   June 30   September 30   December 31   (In millions, except per share amounts) 2017               Revenues, net $ 530     $ 449     $ 515     $ 515   Income from operations 123     68     77     108   Net income 73     32     40     42   Earnings per share:*               Basic 0.82     0.36     0.44     0.48   Diluted 0.82     0.36     0.44     0.48   2016               Revenues, net $ 487     $ 428     $ 484     $ 524   Income from operations 99     64     64     106   Net income 61     37     34     61   Earnings per share:*               Basic 0.68     0.42     0.38     0.68   Diluted 0.68     0.42     0.38     0.68 * Earnings per share are calculated independently for each period presented.

We use acronyms and other defined terms for certain business terms and abbreviations, as defined on the acronyms list and glossary included under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Form 10-K. BUSINESS DESCRIPTION Overview We conduct our business primarily through State Street Bank, which traces its beginnings to the founding of the Union Bank in 1792.  State Street Bank's current charter was authorized by a special Act of the Massachusetts Legislature in 1891, and its present name was adopted in 1960.  State Street Bank operates as a specialized bank, referred to as a trust or custody bank, that services and manages assets on behalf of its institutional clients. Our clients include mutual funds, collective investment funds and other investment pools, corporate and public retirement plans, insurance companies, foundations, endowments and investment managers. Additional Information Additional information about our business activities is provided in the sections that follow.  For information about our management of credit and counterparty risk; liquidity risk; operational risk; market risk associated with our trading activities; market risk associated with our non-trading, or asset-and-liability management, activities, primarily composed of interest-rate risk; and capital, as well as other risks inherent in our businesses, refer to ""Risk Factors"" included under Item 1A, the ""Financial Condition"" section of Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, or Management's Discussion and Analysis, and our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Form 10-K. State Street Corporation | 3 Table of Contents LINES OF BUSINESS We have two lines of business: Investment Servicing and Investment Management. Investment Servicing Our Investment Servicing line of business performs core custody and related value-added functions, such as providing institutional investors with clearing, settlement and payment services.  Our financial services and products allow our large institutional investor clients to execute financial transactions on a daily basis in markets across the globe.  As most institutional investors cannot economically or efficiently build their own technology and operational processes necessary to facilitate their global securities settlement needs, our role as a global trust and custody bank is generally to aid our clients to efficiently perform services associated with the clearing, settlement and execution of securities transactions and related payments. Our investment servicing products and services include: custody; product and participant level accounting; daily pricing and administration; master trust and master custody; depotbank services (a fund oversight role created by regulation); record-keeping; cash management; foreign exchange, brokerage and other trading services; securities finance; our enhanced custody product, which integrates principal securities lending and custody; deposit and short-term investment facilities; loans and lease financing; investment manager and alternative investment manager operations outsourcing; performance, risk and compliance analytics; and financial data management to support institutional investors. We provide some or all of these integrated products and services to clients in the U.S. and in many other markets, including, among others, Australia, Cayman Islands, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg and the U.K.  As of December 31, 2017, we serviced AUCA of approximately $24.42 trillion in the Americas, approximately $7.03 trillion in Europe and the Middle East and approximately $1.67 trillion in the Asia-Pacific region. Investment Management Our Investment Management line of business, through SSGA, provides a broad array of investment management, investment research and investment advisory services to corporations, public funds and other sophisticated investors.  SSGA offers passive and active asset management strategies across equity, fixed-income, alternative, multi-asset solutions (including OCIO) and cash asset classes.  Products are distributed directly and through intermediaries using a variety of investment vehicles, including ETFs, such as the SPDR® ETF brand.  As of December 31, 2017, SSGA had AUM of approximately $2.78 trillion. Additional information about our lines of business is provided under ""Line of Business Information"" included under Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis, and in Note 24 to the consolidated financial statements included under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Form 10-K.  Additional information about our non-U.S. activities is provided in Note 25 to the consolidated financial statements included under Item 8 of this Form 10-K. COMPETITION We operate in a highly competitive environment and face global competition in all areas of our business.  Our competitors include a broad range of financial institutions and servicing companies, including other custodial banks, deposit-taking institutions, investment management firms, insurance companies, mutual funds, broker/dealers, investment banks, benefits consultants, investment analytic businesses, business service and software companies and information services firms.  As our businesses grow and markets evolve, we may encounter increasing and new forms of competition around the world. We believe that many key factors drive competition in the markets for our business.  For Investment Servicing, quality of service, technological expertise, economies of scale, quality and scope of services, sales and marketing, required levels of capital and price drive competition, and are critical to our servicing business.  For Investment Management, key competitive factors include expertise, experience, availability of related service offerings, quality of service and performance and price. Our competitive success may depend on our ability to develop and market new and innovative services, to adopt or develop new technologies, to bring new services to market in a timely fashion at competitive prices, to continue to expand our relationships with existing clients, and to attract new clients. We are a systemically important financial institution and are subject to extensive regulation and supervision with respect to our operations and activities.  Not all of our competitors have similarly been designated as systemically important nor are all of them subject to the same degree of regulation as a bank or financial holding company, and therefore some of our competitors may not be subject to the same limitations, requirements and standards with respect to their operations and activities.  See ""Supervision and Regulation"" in this Item for more information. State Street Corporation | 4 Table of Contents SUPERVISION AND REGULATION State Street is registered with the Federal Reserve as a bank holding company pursuant to the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956.  The Bank Holding Company Act generally limits the activities in which bank holding companies and their non-banking subsidiaries may engage to managing or controlling banks and to a range of activities that are considered to be closely related to banking.  Bank holding companies that have elected to be treated as financial holding companies, such as the Parent Company, may engage in a broader range of activities considered to be ""financial in nature.""  These limits also apply to non-banking entities that we are deemed to ""control"" for purposes of the Bank Holding Company Act, which may include companies of which we own or control more than 5% of a class of voting shares.  The Federal Reserve may order a bank holding company to terminate any activity, or its ownership or control of a non-banking subsidiary, if the Federal Reserve finds that the activity, ownership or control constitutes a serious risk to the financial safety, soundness or stability of a banking subsidiary or is inconsistent with sound banking principles or statutory purposes.  The Bank Holding Company Act also requires a bank holding company to obtain prior approval of the Federal Reserve before it acquires substantially all the assets of any bank, or ownership or control of more than 5% of the voting shares of any bank. The Parent Company has elected to be treated as a financial holding company and, as such, may engage in a broader range of non-banking activities than permitted for bank holding companies and their subsidiaries that have not elected to become financial holding companies.  Financial holding companies may engage directly or indirectly in activities that are defined by the Federal Reserve to be financial in nature, either de novo or by acquisition, provided that the financial holding company gives the Federal Reserve after-the-fact notice of the new activities.  Activities defined to be financial in nature include, but are not limited to, the following: providing financial or investment advice; underwriting; dealing in or making markets in securities; making merchant banking investments, subject to significant limitations; and any activities previously found by the Federal Reserve to be closely related to banking.  In order to maintain our status as a financial holding company, we and each of our U.S. depository institution subsidiaries must be well capitalized and well managed, as defined in applicable regulations and determined in part by the results of regulatory examinations, and must comply with Community Reinvestment Act obligations.  Failure to maintain these standards may ultimately permit the Federal Reserve to take enforcement actions against us and restrict our ability to engage in activities defined to be financial in nature.  Currently, under the Bank Holding Company Act, we may not be able to engage in new activities or acquire shares or control of other businesses. In response to the financial crisis, as well as other factors such as technological and market changes, both the scope of the laws and regulations and the intensity of the supervision to which our business is subject have increased in recent years.  Regulatory enforcement and fines have also increased across the banking and financial services sector.  Many of these changes have occurred as a result of the Dodd-Frank Act and its implementing regulations, most of which are now in place.  The U.S. President has issued an executive order that sets forth principles for the reform of the federal financial regulatory framework, and the Republican majority in Congress has also suggested an agenda for financial regulatory reform.  The implementation of any such reforms, or if implemented whether they would be beneficial to State Street, is uncertain.  Irrespective of any regulatory change, we expect that our business will remain subject to extensive regulation and supervision. In addition, increased regulatory requirements have been and are being implemented internationally with respect to financial institutions, including, but not limited to, the implementation of the Basel III final rule (refer to ""Regulatory Capital Adequacy and Liquidity Standards"" below in this ""Supervision and Regulation"" section and under ""Capital"" in ""Financial Condition"" included under Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis, of this Form 10-K for a discussion of Basel III), the Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive (AIFMD), the Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive (BRRD), the European Market Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR), the Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities (UCITS) directives, the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive II (MiFID II) and the Markets in Financial Instruments Regulation (MiFIR) (the majority of the provisions of MiFID II and MiFIR will apply from January 3, 2018) and the E.U. General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Many aspects of our business are subject to regulation by other U.S. federal and state governmental and regulatory agencies and self-regulatory organizations (including securities exchanges), and by non-U.S. governmental and regulatory agencies and self-regulatory organizations.  Some aspects of our public disclosure, corporate governance principles and internal control systems are subject to SOX, the Dodd-Frank Act and regulations and rules of the SEC and the NYSE. State Street Corporation | 5 Table of Contents Regulatory Capital Adequacy and Liquidity Standards Basel III Final Rule We are subject to the Basel III framework in the U.S.  Provisions of the Basel III final rule become effective under a transition timetable which began in January 2014, with full implementation required beginning on January 1, 2019.  U.S. banking regulators have also jointly issued a final market risk capital rule to implement the changes to the market risk capital framework in the U.S.  The final market risk capital rule became effective and was applicable to State Street in January 2013, and replaced the market risk capital framework associated with Basel I and Basel II. The Basel III final rule provides for two frameworks: the ""standardized"" approach, intended to replace Basel I, and the ""advanced"" approaches, applicable to advanced approaches banking organizations, like State Street, as originally defined under Basel II.  The standardized approach modifies the provisions of Basel I related to the calculation of RWA and prescribes standardized risk weights for certain on- and off-balance sheet exposures. Among other things, the Basel III final rule does the following:  Adds requirements for a minimum common equity tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 4.5% and a minimum supplementary leverage ratio of 3% for advanced approaches banking organizations;  Raises the minimum tier 1 risk-based capital ratio from 4% under Basel I and Basel II to 6%;  Leaves the existing, minimum total capital ratio at 8%;  Implements the capital conservation and countercyclical capital buffers, referenced below, as well as a G-SIB surcharge included under ""Capital"" in ""Financial Condition"" included under Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis, of this Form 10-K;  Implements the previously described standardized approach to replace the calculation of RWA under Basel I; and  Implements the advanced approaches for the calculation of RWA. Additionally, beginning January 1, 2018, the SLR rule introduced a higher minimum SLR requirement for the eight U.S. G-SIBs of at least 6% for the insured banking entity (State Street Bank) in order to be well capitalized under the U.S. banking regulators' PCA framework, as well as a requirement of a minimum SLR of 5% for the holding company (the Parent Company) in order to avoid any limitations on distributions and discretionary bonus payments.  In addition to the SLR, State Street is subject to a minimum tier 1 leverage ratio of 4%, which differs from the SLR primarily in that the denominator of the tier 1 leverage ratio is a quarterly average of on-balance sheet assets and does not include any off-balance sheet exposures.  The Parent Company is required to include SLR disclosures, calculated on a transitional basis, with its other Basel disclosures. Under the Basel III final rule, a banking organization would be able to make capital distributions (subject to other regulatory constraints, such as regulator review of its capital plans) and discretionary bonus payments without specified limitations, as long as it maintains the required capital conservation buffer of 2.5% plus applicable G-SIB surcharge over the minimum required common equity tier 1 risk-based capital ratio and each of the minimum required tier 1 and total risk-based capital ratios (plus any potentially applicable countercyclical capital buffer).  Banking regulators would establish the minimum countercyclical capital buffer, which is initially set by banking regulators at zero, up to a maximum of 2.5% of total risk-weighted assets under certain economic conditions. Under the Basel III final rule, our total regulatory capital is divided into three tiers, composed of common equity tier 1 capital, tier 1 capital (which includes common equity tier 1 capital), and tier 2 capital.  The total of tier 1 and tier 2 capital, adjusted as applicable, is referred to as total regulatory capital. Common equity tier 1 capital is composed of core capital elements, such as qualifying common shareholders' equity and related surplus; retained earnings; the cumulative effect of foreign currency translation; and net unrealized gains (losses) on debt and equity securities classified as AFS; reduced by treasury stock.  Subject to certain phase-in or phase-out provisions, tier 1 capital is composed of common equity tier 1 capital plus additional tier 1 capital composed of qualifying perpetual preferred stock and minority interests.  Goodwill and other intangible assets, net of related deferred tax liabilities, are deducted from common equity tier 1 capital and tier 1 capital.  Subject to certain phase-in or phase-out provisions, tier 2 capital is composed primarily of qualifying subordinated long-term debt. Certain other items, if applicable, must be deducted from tier 1 and tier 2 capital.  These items primarily include deductible investments in unconsolidated banking, financial and insurance entities where we hold more than 50% of the entities' capital; and the amount of expected credit losses that exceeds recorded allowances for loan and other credit losses.  Expected credit losses are calculated for wholesale credit exposures by formula in conformity with the Basel III final rule. State Street Corporation | 6 Table of Contents As required by the Dodd-Frank Act, we and State Street Bank, as advanced approaches banking organizations, are subject to a permanent ""capital floor,"" also referred to as the Collins Amendment, in the assessment of our regulatory capital adequacy, including the capital conservation buffer and countercyclical capital buffer described above in this ""Supervision and Regulation"" section). Since 2015, our risk-based capital ratios for regulatory assessment purposes are the lower of each ratio calculated under the standardized approach and the advanced approaches. Global Systemically Important Bank In addition to the Basel III final rule, we are subject to the Federal Reserve's final rule imposing a capital surcharge on U.S. G-SIBs.  The surcharge requirements within the final rule began to phase-in on January 2016 and will be fully effective on January 1, 2019.  The eight U.S. banks deemed to be G-SIBs, including State Street, are required to calculate the G-SIB surcharge according to two methods, and be bound by the higher of the two:  Method 1: Assesses systemic importance based upon five equally-weighted components: size, interconnectedness, complexity, cross-jurisdictional activity and substitutability;  Method 2:  Alters the calculation from Method 1 by factoring in a wholesale funding score in place of substitutability and applying a 2x multiplier to the sum of the five components Method 2 is identified as the binding methodology for State Street and the applicable surcharge on January 1, 2017 was calculated to be 1.5%.  Assuming completion of the phase-in period for the capital conservation buffer, and a countercyclical buffer of 0%, the minimum capital ratios as of January 1, 2019, including a capital conservation buffer of 2.5% and G-SIB surcharge of 1.5% in 2019, would be 8.5% for common equity tier 1 capital, 10.0% for tier 1 risk-based capital and 12.0% for total risk-based capital, in order for State Street to make capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments without limitation.  Further, State Street, like all other U.S. G-SIBs, is also subject to a 2% leverage buffer under the Basel III final rule.  If State Street fails to exceed the 2% leverage buffer, it will be subject to increased restrictions (depending upon the extent of the shortfall) regarding capital distributions and discretionary executive bonus payments.  Not all of our competitors have similarly been designated as systemically important nor are all of them subject to the same degree of regulation as a bank or financial holding company, and therefore some of our competitors may not be subject to the same additional capital requirements. Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity (TLAC) In December 2016, the Federal Reserve released its final rule on TLAC, LTD and clean holding company requirements for U.S. domiciled G-SIBs, such as State Street, that are intended to improve the resiliency and resolvability of certain U.S. banking organizations through enhanced prudential standards. The TLAC final rule imposes: (1) TLAC requirements (i.e., combined eligible tier 1 regulatory capital and eligible LTD); (2) separate eligible LTD requirements; and (3) clean holding company requirements designed to make short-term unsecured debt (including deposits) and most other ineligible liabilities structurally senior to eligible LTD. Among other things, the TLAC final rule requires State Street to comply with minimum requirements for external TLAC and external LTD, plus an external TLAC buffer.  Specifically, State Street must hold (1) combined eligible tier 1 regulatory capital and eligible LTD in the amount equal to at least 21.5% of total risk-weighted assets (using an estimated G-SIB method 1 surcharge of 1%) and 9.5% of total leverage exposure, as defined by the SLR final rule, and (2) qualifying external LTD equal to the greater of 7.5% of risk-weighted assets (using an estimated G-SIB method 2 surcharge of 1.5%) and 4.5% of total leverage exposure, as defined by the SLR final rule. Based upon current estimates, assumptions and guidance, we project that compliance with TLAC and LTD will result in increasing our outstanding LTD by approximately $1.5 billion at December 31, 2018 compared to debt outstanding at December 31, 2017.  Our estimates regarding TLAC and LTD are subject to additional regulatory guidance and interpretation. State Street must comply with the TLAC final rule starting on January 1, 2019. Liquidity Coverage Ratio and Net Stable Funding Ratio In addition to capital standards, the Basel III final rule introduced two quantitative liquidity standards: the LCR and the NSFR. We are subject to the final rule issued by the U.S. banking regulators implementing the BCBS' LCR in the U.S.  The LCR is intended to promote the short-term resilience of internationally active banking organizations, like State Street, to improve the banking industry's ability to absorb shocks arising from market stress over a 30 calendar day period and improve the measurement and management of liquidity risk. The LCR measures an institution's HQLA against its net cash outflows.  We report LCR to the Federal Reserve daily.  As of December 31, 2017, our LCR was in excess of the requirement of 100%.  In addition, we publicly disclose certain qualitative and quantitative information about our LCR consistent State Street Corporation | 7 Table of Contents with the requirements of the Federal Reserve's December 2016 final rule. Compliance with the LCR has required that we maintain an investment portfolio that contains an adequate amount of HQLA.  In general, HQLA investments generate a lower investment return than other types of investments, resulting in a negative impact on our NII and our NIM.  In addition, the level of HQLA we are required to maintain under the LCR is dependent upon our client relationships and the nature of services we provide, which may change over time.  Deposits resulting from certain services provided (""operational deposits"") are treated as more resilient during periods of stress than other deposits. As a result, if balances of operational deposits increased relative to our total client deposit base, we would expect to require less HQLA in order to maintain our LCR. Conversely, if balances of operational deposits decreased relative to our total client deposit base, we would expect to require more HQLA. The BCBS has also issued final guidance with respect to the NSFR.  In the second quarter of 2016, the OCC, Federal Reserve and FDIC issued a proposal to implement the NSFR in the U.S. that is largely consistent with the BCBS guidance. The proposal would require banking organizations to maintain an amount of available stable funding, which is calculated by applying standardized weightings to its equity and liabilities based on their expected stability, that is no less than the amount of its required stable funding, which is calculated by applying standardized weightings to its assets, derivatives exposures, and certain other off-balance sheet exposures based on their liquidity characteristics. Failure to meet current and future regulatory capital requirements could subject us to a variety of enforcement actions, including the termination of State Street Bank's deposit insurance by the FDIC, and to certain restrictions on our business, including those that are described above in this ""Supervision and Regulation"" section. For additional information about our regulatory capital position and our regulatory capital adequacy, as well as current and future regulatory capital requirements, refer to ""Capital"" in ""Financial Condition"" included under Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis, and Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements included under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Form 10-K. Capital Planning, Stress Tests and Dividends Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, the Federal Reserve has adopted capital planning and stress test requirements for large bank holding companies, including us, which form part of the Federal Reserve's annual CCAR framework.  CCAR is used by the Federal Reserve to evaluate our management of capital, the adequacy of our regulatory capital and the potential requirement for us to maintain capital levels above regulatory minimums.  Under the Federal Reserve's capital plan final rule, we must conduct periodic stress testing of our business operations and submit an annual capital plan to the Federal Reserve, taking into account the results of separate stress tests designed by us and by the Federal Reserve. The capital plan must include a description of all of our planned capital actions over a nine-quarter planning horizon, including any issuance of debt or equity capital instruments, any capital distributions, such as payments of dividends on, or purchases of, our stock, and any similar action that the Federal Reserve determines could affect our consolidated capital.  The capital plan must include a discussion of how we will maintain capital above the minimum regulatory capital ratios, including the minimum ratios under the Basel III final rule that are phased in over the planning horizon, and serve as a source of strength to our U.S. depository institution subsidiaries under supervisory stress scenarios.  The capital plan requirements mandate that we receive no objection to our plan from the Federal Reserve before making a capital distribution.  These requirements could require us to revise our stress-testing or capital management approaches, resubmit our capital plan or postpone, cancel or alter our planned capital actions.  In addition, changes in our strategy, merger or acquisition activity or unanticipated uses of capital could result in a change in our capital plan and its associated capital actions, including capital raises or modifications to planned capital actions, such as purchases of our stock, and may require resubmission of the capital plan to the Federal Reserve for its non-objection if, among other reasons, we would not meet our regulatory capital requirements after making the proposed capital distribution. In addition to its capital planning requirements, the Federal Reserve has the authority to prohibit or to limit the payment of dividends by the banking organizations it supervises, including the Parent Company and State Street Bank, if, in the Federal Reserve's opinion, the payment of a dividend would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice in light of the financial condition of the banking organization.  All of these policies and other requirements could affect our ability to pay dividends and purchase our stock, or require us to provide capital assistance to State Street Bank and any other banking subsidiary. In June 2017, we received the results of the Federal Reserve's review of our 2017 capital plan in connection with its 2017 annual CCAR process.  The Federal Reserve did not object to the capital actions we proposed in our 2017 capital plan and, in June 2017, our Board approved a new common stock State Street Corporation | 8 Table of Contents purchase program authorizing the purchase of up to $1.4 billion of our common stock from July 1, 2017 through June 30, 2018.  As of December 31, 2017, we purchased approximately 7.4 million shares of our common stock at an average per-share cost of $94.54 and an aggregate cost of approximately $700 million under this program.  Our 2017 capital plan included an increase, subject to approval by our Board, to our quarterly stock dividend to $0.42 per share from $0.38 per share, beginning in the third quarter of 2017.  Our common stock and other stock dividends, including the declaration, timing and amount thereof, remain subject to consideration and approval by our Board of Directors at the relevant times. The Federal Reserve, under the Dodd-Frank Act, requires us to conduct semi-annual State Street-run stress tests and to publicly disclose the summary results of our State Street-run stress tests under the severely adverse economic scenario.  In October 2017, we provided summary results of our 2017 mid-cycle State Street-run stress tests on the ""Investor Relations"" section of our corporate website.  We are also required to undergo an annual supervisory stress test conducted by the Federal Reserve. The Dodd-Frank Act also requires State Street Bank to conduct an annual stress test.  State Street Bank must submit its 2018 annual State Street Bank-run stress test to the Federal Reserve by April 5, 2018. In January 2017, the Federal Reserve adopted revisions to the capital plan and stress test requirements that, among other things, reduce the de minimis threshold for additional capital distributions that a firm may make during a capital plan cycle without seeking the Federal Reserve's prior approval. The final rule also establishes a one-quarter ""blackout period"" while the Federal Reserve is conducting CCAR during which firms are not permitted to submit de minimis exception notices or prior approval requests for additional capital distributions.  The Federal Reserve is currently considering making further changes to CCAR requirements, which may change our minimum capital requirements. The Volcker Rule We are subject to the Volcker rule and implementing regulations.  The Volcker rule prohibits banking entities, including us and our affiliates, from engaging in certain prohibited proprietary trading activities, as defined in the final Volcker rule regulations, subject to exemptions for market-making related activities, risk-mitigating hedging, underwriting and certain other activities.  The Volcker rule also requires banking entities to either restructure or divest certain ownership interests in, and relationships with, covered funds (as such terms are defined in the final Volcker rule regulations). The final Volcker rule regulations require banking entities to establish extensive programs designed to ensure compliance with the restrictions of the Volcker rule.  We have established a compliance program which we believe complies with the final Volcker rule regulations as currently in effect.  Such compliance program restricts our ability in the future to service certain types of funds, in particular covered funds for which SSGA acts as an advisor and certain types of trustee relationships.  Consequently, Volcker rule compliance entails both the cost of a compliance program and loss of certain revenue and future opportunities. Enhanced Prudential Standards As a SIFI, we are subject to heightened prudential standards, including heightened capital, leverage, liquidity and risk management requirements, single-counterparty credit limits and early remediation requirements.  Bank holding companies with $50 billion or more in consolidated assets, which includes us, became automatically subject to the systemic-risk regime in 2010. The FSOC can recommend prudential standards, reporting and disclosure requirements to the Federal Reserve for SIFIs, and must approve any finding by the Federal Reserve that a financial institution poses a grave threat to financial stability and must undertake mitigating actions.  The FSOC is also empowered to designate systemically important payment, clearing and settlement activities of financial institutions, subjecting them to prudential supervision and regulation, and, assisted by the  Office of Financial Research within the U.S. Department of the Treasury can gather data and reports from financial institutions, including us. Under the Federal Reserve's final rule implementing certain enhanced prudential standards for large bank holding companies, we are required to comply with various liquidity-related risk management standards and maintain a liquidity buffer of unencumbered highly liquid assets based on the results of internal liquidity stress testing.  This liquidity buffer is in addition to other liquidity requirements, such as the LCR and, when implemented, the NSFR.  The final rule also establishes requirements and responsibilities for our risk committee and mandates risk management standards.  We became subject to these standards in January 2015. In March 2016, the Federal Reserve re-proposed rules that would establish single-counterparty credit limits for large banking organizations, with more stringent limits for the largest banking organizations. U.S. G-SIBs, including us, would be subject to a limit of 15% of tier 1 capital for credit exposures to any ""major counterparty"" (defined as other U.S. G-SIBs, foreign G-SIBs and non-bank SIFIs supervised by the State Street Corporation | 9 Table of Contents Federal Reserve) and to a limit of 25% of tier 1 capital for credit exposures to any other unaffiliated counterparty. In September 2017, the Federal Reserve issued a final rule that imposes contractual requirements on certain ""qualified financial contracts"" to which U.S. G-SIBs, including us, and their subsidiaries are parties. Under the final rule, certain qualified financial contracts generally must expressly provide that transfer restrictions and default rights against a U.S. G-SIB, or subsidiary of a U.S. G-SIB, are limited to the same extent as they would be under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act and Title II of the Dodd-Frank Act and their implementing regulations. In addition, certain qualified financial contracts may not, among other things, permit the exercise of any cross-default right against a U.S. G-SIB or subsidiary of a U.S. G-SIB based on an affiliate's entry into insolvency, resolution or similar proceedings, subject to certain creditor protections.  There is a phased-in compliance schedule based on counterparty type, with a first compliance date of January 1, 2019. In addition, the final rules create an early-remediation regime to address financial distress or material management weaknesses determined with reference to four levels of early remediation, including heightened supervisory review, initial remediation, recovery, and resolution assessment, with specific limitations and requirements tied to each level. The systemic-risk regime also provides that, for institutions deemed to pose a grave threat to U.S. financial stability, the Federal Reserve, upon an FSOC vote, must limit that institution's ability to merge, restrict its ability to offer financial products, require it to terminate activities, impose conditions on activities or, as a last resort, require it to dispose of assets.  Upon a grave-threat determination by the FSOC, the Federal Reserve must issue rules that require financial institutions subject to the systemic-risk regime to maintain a debt-to-equity ratio of no more than 15 to 1 if the FSOC considers it necessary to mitigate the risk of the grave threat.  The Federal Reserve also has the ability to establish further standards, including those regarding contingent capital, enhanced public disclosures, and limits on short-term debt, including off-balance sheet exposures. Resolution Planning State Street, like other bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of $50 billion or more, periodically submits a plan for rapid and orderly resolution in the event of material financial distress or failure  -  commonly referred to as a resolution plan or a living will  -  to the Federal Reserve and the FDIC under Section 165(d) of the Dodd-Frank Act. Through resolution planning, we seek, in the event of the insolvency of State Street, to maintain State Street Bank's role as a key infrastructure provider within the financial system, while minimizing risk to the financial system and maximizing value for the benefit of our stakeholders. We have and will continue to focus management attention and resources to meet regulatory expectations with respect to resolution planning. We submitted our 2017 resolution plan describing our preferred resolution strategy to the Federal Reserve and FDIC on June 30, 2017.  On December 19, 2017, the Federal Reserve and FDIC announced that they had completed their review and had not identified deficiencies or specific shortcomings.  Nonetheless, the agencies identified four common areas in which more work may need to be done by all firms, including State Street, to continue to improve resolvability: intra-group liquidity; internal loss-absorbing capacity; derivatives; and payment, clearing and settlement activities. State Street's next resolution plan is due July 1, 2019. In the event of material financial distress or failure, our preferred resolution strategy is the SPOE Strategy.  The SPOE Strategy provides that prior to the bankruptcy of the Parent Company and pursuant to a support agreement among the Parent Company, SSIF (a direct subsidiary of the Parent Company), State Street's Beneficiary Entities (as defined below) and certain other State Street entities, SSIF is obligated, up to its available resources, to recapitalize and/or provide liquidity to State Street Bank and the other State Street entities benefiting from such capital and/or liquidity support (collectively with State Street Bank, ""Beneficiary Entities""), in amounts designed to prevent the Beneficiary Entities from themselves entering into resolution proceedings.  Following the recapitalization of, or provision of liquidity to the Beneficiary Entities, the Parent Company would enter into a bankruptcy proceeding under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.  The Beneficiary Entities and other State Street subsidiaries would be transferred to a newly organized holding company held by a reorganization trust for the benefit of the Parent Company's claimants. Under the support agreement, the Parent Company has pre-funded SSIF by contributing certain of its assets (primarily its liquid assets, cash deposits, investments in intercompany debt, investments in marketable securities and other cash and non-cash equivalent investments) to SSIF contemporaneous with entering into the support agreement and will continue to contribute such assets, to the extent available, on an on-going basis.  In consideration for these contributions, SSIF has agreed in the support agreement to provide capital and liquidity support to the Parent Company and all of the Beneficiary Entities in accordance with the Parent Company's capital and liquidity policies.  Under the support agreement, the Parent Company is only permitted to State Street Corporation | 10 Table of Contents retain cash needed to meet its upcoming obligations and to fund expected expenses during a potential bankruptcy proceeding.  SSIF has provided the Parent Company with a committed credit line and issued (and may issue) one or more promissory notes to the Parent Company (the ""Parent Company Funding Notes"") that together are intended to allow the Parent Company to continue to meet its obligations throughout the period prior to the occurrence of a ""Recapitalization Event"" (as defined below).  The support agreement does not contemplate that SSIF is obligated to maintain any specific level of resources and SSIF may not have sufficient resources to implement the SPOE Strategy. In the event a Recapitalization Event occurs, the obligations outstanding under the Parent Company Funding Notes would automatically convert into or be exchanged for capital contributed to SSIF.  The obligations of the Parent Company and SSIF under the support agreement are secured through a security agreement that grants a lien on the assets that the Parent Company and SSIF would use to fulfill their obligations under the support agreement to the Beneficiary Entities.  SSIF is a distinct legal entity separate from the Parent Company and the Parent Company's other affiliates. In accordance with its policies, State Street is required to monitor, on an ongoing basis, the capital and liquidity needs of State Street Bank and the other Beneficiary Entities.  To support this process, State Street has established a trigger framework that identifies key actions that would need to be taken or decisions that would need to be made if certain events tied to State Street's financial condition occur.  In the event that State Street experiences material financial distress, the support agreement requires State Street to model and calculate certain capital and liquidity triggers on a regular basis to determine whether or not the Parent Company should commence preparations for a bankruptcy filing and whether or not a Recapitalization Event has occurred. Upon the occurrence of a Recapitalization Event: (1) SSIF would not be authorized to provide any further liquidity to the Parent Company; (2) the Parent Company would be required to contribute to SSIF any remaining assets it is required to contribute to SSIF under the support agreement (which specifically exclude amounts designated to fund expected expenses during a potential bankruptcy proceeding); (3) SSIF would be required to provide capital and liquidity support to the Beneficiary Entities to support such entities' continued operation to the extent of its available resources and consistent with the support agreement; and (4) the Parent Company would be expected to commence Chapter 11 proceedings under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.  No person or entity, other than a party to the support agreement, should rely, including in evaluating any State Street entity from a creditor's perspective or determining whether to enter into a contractual relationship with any State Street entity, on any State Street affiliate being or remaining a Beneficiary Entity or receiving capital or liquidity support pursuant to the support agreement. A ""Recapitalization Event"" is defined under the support agreement as the earlier occurrence of one or more capital and liquidity thresholds being breached or the authorization by the Parent Company's Board of Directors for the Parent Company to commence bankruptcy proceedings. These thresholds are set at levels intended to provide for the availability of sufficient capital and liquidity to enable an orderly resolution without extraordinary government support.  The SPOE Strategy and the obligations under the support agreement may result in the recapitalization of State Street Bank and the commencement of bankruptcy proceedings by the Parent Company at an earlier stage of financial stress than might otherwise occur without such mechanisms in place.  An expected effect of the SPOE Strategy and applicable TLAC regulatory requirements is that State Street's losses will be imposed on the Parent Company shareholders and the holders of long-term debt and other forms of TLAC securities currently outstanding or issued in the future by the Parent Company, as well as on any other Parent Company creditors, before any of its losses are imposed on the holders of the debt securities of the Parent Company's operating subsidiaries or any of their depositors or creditors, or before U.S. taxpayers are put at risk. There can be no assurance that credit rating agencies, in response to our resolution plan or the support agreement, will not downgrade, place on negative watch or change their outlook on our debt credit ratings, generally or on specific debt securities.  Any such downgrade, placement on negative watch or change in outlook could adversely affect our cost of borrowing, limit our access to the capital markets or result in restrictive covenants in future debt agreements and could also adversely impact the trading prices, or the liquidity, of our outstanding debt securities. State Street Bank is also required to submit periodically to the FDIC a plan for resolution in the event of its failure, referred to as an IDI plan.  Under the IDI plan rule, submission of the IDI plan is scheduled for July 1, 2018. Orderly Liquidation Authority Under the Dodd-Frank Act, certain financial companies, including bank holding companies such as State Street, and certain covered subsidiaries, can be subjected to the orderly liquidation authority.  The U.S. Treasury Secretary, in consultation with the U.S. President, must first make certain extraordinary State Street Corporation | 11 Table of Contents financial distress and systemic risk determinations, and action must be recommended by two-thirds of the FDIC Board and two-thirds of the Federal Reserve Board.  Absent such actions, we, as a bank holding company, would remain subject to the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. The orderly liquidation authority went into effect in 2010, and rulemaking is proceeding in stages, with some regulations now finalized and others planned but not yet proposed.  If we were subject to the orderly liquidation authority, the FDIC would be appointed as the receiver of State Street Bank, which would give the FDIC considerable powers to resolve us, including: (1) the power to remove officers and directors responsible for our failure and to appoint new directors and officers; (2) the power to assign assets and liabilities to a third party or bridge financial company without the need for creditor consent or prior court review; (3) the ability to differentiate among creditors, including by treating junior creditors better than senior creditors, subject to a minimum recovery right to receive at least what they would have received in bankruptcy liquidation; and (4) broad powers to administer the claims process to determine distributions from the assets of the receivership to creditors not transferred to a third party or bridge financial institution. In  2013, the FDIC released its proposed single-point-of-entry strategy for resolution of a SIFI under the orderly liquidation authority. The FDIC's release outlines how it would use its powers under the orderly liquidation authority to resolve a SIFI by placing its top-tier U.S. holding company in receivership and keeping its operating subsidiaries open and out of insolvency proceedings by transferring the operating subsidiaries to a new bridge holding company, recapitalizing the operating subsidiaries and imposing losses on the shareholders and creditors of the holding company in receivership according to their statutory order of priority. Derivatives Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Act imposed a comprehensive regulatory structure on the OTC derivatives market, including requirements for clearing, exchange trading, capital, margin, reporting and record-keeping. Title VII also requires certain persons to register as a major swap participant, a swap dealer or a securities-based swap dealer.  The CFTC, the SEC, and other U.S. regulators have largely implemented key provisions of Title VII, although certain final regulations have only been in place a short period of time and others have not been finalized.  Through this rulemaking process, these regulators collectively have adopted or proposed, among other things, regulations relating to reporting and record-keeping obligations, margin and capital requirements, the scope of registration and the central clearing and exchange trading requirements for certain over-the-counter derivatives.  The CFTC has also issued rules to enhance the oversight of clearing and trading entities.  The CFTC, along with other regulators, including the Federal Reserve, have also issued final rules with respect to margin requirements for uncleared derivatives transactions. State Street Bank has registered provisionally with the CFTC as a swap dealer.  As a provisionally registered swap dealer, State Street Bank is subject to significant regulatory obligations regarding its swap activity and the supervision, examination and enforcement powers of the CFTC and other regulators.  The CFTC has granted State Street Bank a limited-purpose swap dealer designation.  Under this limited-purpose designation, interest-rate swap activity engaged in by State Street Bank's Global Treasury group is not subject to certain of the swap regulatory requirements otherwise applicable to swaps entered into by a registered swap dealer, subject to a number of conditions.  For all other swap transactions, our swap activities remain subject to all applicable swap dealer regulations. Money Market Funds The SEC has adopted amendments to the regulations governing money market funds to address potential systemic risks and improve transparency for money market fund investors.  Among other things, the amendments require a floating net asset value for institutional prime money market funds (i.e., money market funds that are either not restricted to natural person investors or not restricted to investing primarily in U.S. government securities) and permit (and in some cases require) all money market funds to impose redemption fees and gates under certain circumstances.  As a result of these reforms, money market funds may be required to take certain steps that will affect their structure and/or operations, which could in turn affect the liquidity, marketability and return potential of such funds.  Full conformance with these amendments was required by October 14, 2016. Money market reforms are also being introduced in Europe in 2018 and 2019.  The SEC's amended regulations, and the potential reforms in Europe, could alter the business models of money market fund sponsors and asset managers, including many of our servicing clients and SSGA, and may result in reduced levels of investment in money market funds.  As a result, these requirements may have an adverse impact on our business, our operations or our consolidated results of operations. Subsidiaries The Federal Reserve is the primary federal banking agency responsible for regulating us and our subsidiaries, including State Street Bank, with respect to both our U.S. and non-U.S. operations. State Street Corporation | 12 Table of Contents Our banking subsidiaries are subject to supervision and examination by various regulatory authorities.  State Street Bank is a member of the Federal Reserve System, its deposits are insured by the FDIC and it is subject to applicable federal and state banking laws and to supervision and examination by the Federal Reserve, as well as by the Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks, the FDIC, and the regulatory authorities of those states and countries in which State Street Bank operates a branch.  Our other subsidiary trust companies are subject to supervision and examination by the OCC, the Federal Reserve or by the appropriate state banking regulatory authorities of the states in which they are organized and operate.  Our non-U.S. banking subsidiaries are subject to regulation by the regulatory authorities of the countries in which they operate. We and our subsidiaries that are not subsidiaries of State Street Bank are affiliates of State Street Bank under federal banking laws, which impose restrictions on various types of transactions, including loans, extensions of credit, investments or asset purchases by or from State Street Bank, on the one hand, to us and those of our subsidiaries, on the other.  Transactions of this kind between State Street Bank and its affiliates are limited with respect to each affiliate to 10% of State Street Bank's capital and surplus, as defined by the aforementioned banking laws, and to 20% in the aggregate for all affiliates, and in some cases are also subject to strict collateral requirements.  Derivatives, securities borrowing and securities lending transactions between State Street Bank and its affiliates became subject to these restrictions pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act.  The Dodd-Frank Act also expanded the scope of transactions required to be collateralized.  In addition, the Volcker rule generally prohibits similar transactions between the Parent Company or any of its affiliates and covered funds for which we or any of our affiliates serve as the investment manager, investment adviser, commodity trading advisor or sponsor and other covered funds organized and offered pursuant to specific exemptions in the final Volcker rule regulations. Federal law also requires that certain transactions by a bank with affiliates be on terms and under circumstances, including credit standards, that are substantially the same, or at least as favorable to the bank, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions involving other non-affiliated companies.  Alternatively, in the absence of comparable transactions, the transactions must be on terms and under circumstances, including credit standards, that in good faith would be offered to, or would apply to, non-affiliated companies. State Street Bank is also prohibited from engaging in certain tie-in arrangements in connection with any extension of credit or lease or sale of property or furnishing of services.  Federal law provides as well for a depositor preference on amounts realized from the liquidation or other resolution of any depository institution insured by the FDIC. Our subsidiaries, SSGA FM and SSGA Ltd., act as investment advisers to investment companies registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940.  SSGA FM, incorporated in Massachusetts in 2001 and headquartered in Boston, Massachusetts, is registered with the SEC as an investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and is registered with the CFTC as a commodity trading adviser and pool operator.  SSGA Ltd., incorporated in 1990 as a U.K. limited company and domiciled in the U.K., is also registered with the SEC as an investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.  SSGA Ltd. is also authorized and regulated by the FCA and is an investment firm under the MiFID.  Our subsidiary, State Street Global Advisors Asia Limited (SSGA Asia), a Hong Kong incorporated company, is registered as an investment adviser with the SEC and additionally is licensed by the Securities and Futures Commission of Hong Kong to perform a variety of activities, including asset management.  SSGA Asia also holds permits as a qualified foreign institutional Investor (QFII) and a renminbi qualified foreign institutional investor (RQFII), approved by the Securities Regulatory Commission in the People's Republic of China, and in Korea is registered with the Financial Services Commission as a cross-border investment advisory company and a cross-border discretionary investment management company. In addition, a major portion of our investment management activities are conducted by State Street Global Advisors Trust Company, which is a subsidiary of State Street Bank and a Massachusetts chartered trust company subject to the supervision of the Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks and the Federal Reserve with respect to these activities.  Many aspects of our investment management activities are subject to federal and state laws and regulations primarily intended to benefit the investment holder, rather than our shareholders. These laws and regulations generally grant supervisory agencies and bodies broad administrative powers, including the power to limit or restrict us from conducting our investment management activities in the event that we fail to comply with such laws and regulations, and examination authority.  Our business related to investment management and trusteeship of collective trust funds and separate accounts offered to employee benefit plans is subject to ERISA, and is regulated by the U.S. DOL. State Street Corporation | 13 Table of Contents State Street has two subsidiaries that operate as a U.S. broker/dealer and are registered as such with the SEC, are subject to regulation by the SEC (including the SEC's net capital rule) and are members of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, a self-regulatory organization. State Street Global Advisors Funds Distributors LLC, (SSGAFD) operates as a limited purpose broker/dealer distributing and related marketing activities for SSGA's U.S. mutual funds and ETFs.  SSGAFD also acts as a placement agent for certain private funds advised by SSGA FM.  Our other U.S. broker/dealer is State Street Global Markets LLC (SSGM LLC) which provides agency execution services. The U.K. broker/dealer business operates through our subsidiary, State Street Global Markets International Limited, which is registered in the U.K. as a regulated securities broker, is authorized and regulated by the FCA and is an investment firm under the MiFID, and is a member of the London Stock Exchange.  In accordance with the rules of the FCA, the U.K. broker/dealer publishes information on its risk management objectives and on policies associated with its regulatory capital requirements and resources. Our activities as a futures commission merchant are subject to regulation by the CFTC in the U.S. and various regulatory authorities internationally, as well as the membership requirements of the applicable clearinghouses.  In addition, we have a subsidiary registered with the CFTC as a swap execution facility. Our businesses, including our investment management and securities and futures businesses, are also regulated extensively by non-U.S. governments, securities exchanges, self-regulatory organizations, central banks and regulatory bodies, especially in those jurisdictions in which we maintain an office.  For instance, among others, the FCA, the U.K. PRA and the Bank of England regulate our activities in the U.K.; the Central Bank of Ireland regulates our activities in Ireland; the German Federal Financial Supervisory Authority regulates our activities in Germany; the Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier regulates our activities in Luxembourg; our German banking group is also subject to direct supervision by the European Central Bank under the ECB Single Supervisory Mechanism; the Securities and Futures Commission regulates our asset management activities in Hong Kong; the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority and the Australian Securities and Investments Commission regulate our activities in Australia; and the Financial Services Agency and the Bank of Japan regulate our activities in Japan.  We have established policies, procedures, and systems designed to comply with the requirements of these organizations.  However, as a global financial services institution, we face complexity, costs and risks related to regulation. The majority of our non-U.S. asset servicing operations are conducted pursuant to the Federal Reserve's Regulation K through State Street Bank's Edge Act subsidiary or through international branches of State Street Bank.  An Edge Act corporation is a corporation organized under federal law that conducts foreign business activities.  In general, banks may not make investments in their Edge Act corporations (and similar state law corporations) that exceed 20% of their capital and surplus, as defined, and the investment of any amount in excess of 10% of capital and surplus requires the prior approval of the Federal Reserve. In addition to our non-U.S. operations conducted pursuant to Regulation K, we also make new investments abroad directly (through us or through our non-banking subsidiaries) pursuant to the Federal Reserve's Regulation Y, or through international bank branch expansion, neither of which is subject to the investment limitations applicable to Edge Act subsidiaries. Additionally, Massachusetts has its own bank holding company statute, under which State Street, among other things, may be required to obtain prior approval by the Massachusetts Board of Bank Incorporation for an acquisition of more than 5% of any additional bank's voting shares, or for other forms of bank acquisitions. Anti-Money Laundering and Financial Transparency We and certain of our subsidiaries are subject to the Bank Secrecy Act of 1970, as amended by the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001, and related regulations, which contain AML and financial transparency provisions and which require implementation of  an AML compliance program, including processes for verifying client identification and monitoring client transactions and detecting and reporting suspicious activities.  AML laws outside the U.S. contain similar requirements.  We have implemented policies, procedures and internal controls that are designed to promote compliance with applicable AML laws and regulations.  AML laws and regulations applicable to our operations may be more stringent than similar requirements applicable to our non-regulated competitors or financial institutions principally operating in other jurisdictions.  Compliance with applicable AML and related requirements is a common area of review for financial regulators, and any failure by us to comply with these requirements could result in fines, penalties, lawsuits, regulatory sanctions, difficulties in obtaining governmental approvals, restrictions on our business activities or harm to our reputation. On June 1, 2015, we entered into a written agreement with the Federal Reserve and the Massachusetts Division of Banks relating to State Street Corporation | 14 Table of Contents deficiencies identified in our compliance programs with the requirements of the Bank Secrecy Act, AML regulations and U.S. economic sanctions regulations promulgated by OFAC.  As part of this agreement, we have been required to, among other things, implement improvements to our compliance programs and retain an independent firm to conduct a review of account and transaction activity to evaluate whether any suspicious activity was not previously reported.  If we fail to comply with the terms of the written agreement, we may become subject to fines and other regulatory sanctions, which may have a material adverse effect on us. Deposit Insurance FDIC-insured depository institutions are required to pay deposit insurance assessments to the FDIC.  The Dodd-Frank Act made permanent the general $250,000 deposit insurance limit for insured deposits. The FDIC's DIF is funded by assessments on insured depository institutions.  The FDIC assesses DIF premiums based on an insured depository institution's average consolidated total assets, less the average tangible equity of the insured depository institution during the assessment period.  For larger institutions, such as State Street Bank, assessments are determined based on regulatory ratings and forward-looking financial measures to calculate the assessment rate, which is subject to adjustments by the FDIC, and the assessment base. The FDIC is required to determine whether and to what extent adjustments to the assessment base are appropriate for ""custody banks"" that satisfy specified institutional eligibility criteria.  The FDIC has concluded that certain liquid assets could be excluded from the deposit insurance assessment base of custody banks.  This has the effect of reducing the amount of DIF insurance premiums due from custody banks.  State Street Bank is a custody bank for this purpose.  The custody bank assessment adjustment may not exceed total transaction account deposits identified by the institution as being directly linked to a fiduciary or custody and safekeeping asset. In March 2016, the FDIC issued a final rule that imposes on IDIs with at least $10 billion in assets, which includes State Street Bank, a surcharge of 4.5 cents per $100 per annum of their assessment base for deposit insurance,  as defined by the FDIC, until the DIF reaches the required ratio of 1.35, which the FDIC estimates will occur in 2018. The surcharge took effect for the assessment period beginning July 2016. Prompt Corrective Action The FDIC Improvement Act of 1991 requires the appropriate federal banking regulator to take ""prompt corrective action"" with respect to a depository institution if that institution does not meet certain capital adequacy standards, including minimum capital ratios.  While these regulations apply only to banks, such as State Street Bank, the Federal Reserve is authorized to take appropriate action against a parent bank holding company, such as our Parent Company, based on the under-capitalized status of any banking subsidiary.  In certain instances, we would be required to guarantee the performance of a capital restoration plan if one of our banking subsidiaries were undercapitalized. Support of Subsidiary Banks Under Federal Reserve regulations, a bank holding company such as our Parent Company is required to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to its banking subsidiaries.  This requirement was added to the Federal Deposit Insurance Act by the Dodd-Frank Act.  This means that we have a statutory obligation to commit resources to State Street Bank and any other banking subsidiary in circumstances in which we otherwise might not do so absent such a requirement.  In the event of bankruptcy, any commitment by us to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a banking subsidiary will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and will be entitled to a priority payment. Insolvency of an Insured U.S. Subsidiary Depository Institution If the FDIC is appointed the conservator or receiver of an FDIC-insured U.S. subsidiary depository institution, such as State Street Bank, upon its insolvency or certain other events, the FDIC has the ability to transfer any of the depository institution's assets and liabilities to a new obligor without the approval of the depository institution's creditors, enforce the terms of the depository institution's contracts pursuant to their terms or repudiate or disaffirm contracts or leases to which the depository institution is a party.  Additionally, the claims of holders of deposit liabilities and certain claims for administrative expenses against an insured depository institution would be afforded priority over other general unsecured claims against such an institution, including claims of debt holders of the institution and, under current interpretation, depositors in non-U.S. branches and offices, in the liquidation or other resolution of such an institution by any receiver.  As a result, such persons would be treated differently from and could receive, if anything, substantially less than the depositors in U.S. offices of the depository institution. ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND GOVERNMENT POLICIES Economic policies of the U.S. government and its agencies influence our operating environment.  Monetary policy conducted by the Federal Reserve State Street Corporation | 15 Table of Contents directly affects the level of interest rates, which may affect overall credit conditions of the economy.  Monetary policy is applied by the Federal Reserve through open market operations in U.S. government securities, changes in reserve requirements for depository institutions, and changes in the discount rate and availability of borrowing from the Federal Reserve.  Government regulation of banks and bank holding companies is intended primarily for the protection of depositors of the banks, rather than for the shareholders of the institutions and therefore may, in some cases, be adverse to the interests of those shareholders.  We are similarly affected by the economic policies of non-U.S. government agencies, such as the ECB. CYBER RISK MANAGEMENT In October 2016, the Federal Reserve, FDIC and OCC issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking regarding enhanced cyber risk management standards, which would apply to a wide range of large financial institutions and their third-party service providers, including State Street and its banking subsidiaries. The proposed standards would expand existing cybersecurity regulations and guidance to focus on cyber risk governance and management; management of internal and external dependencies; and incident response, cyber resilience and situational awareness. In addition, the proposal contemplates more stringent standards for institutions with systems that are critical to the financial sector.

State Street Corporation | 19 Table of Contents Risk Factors In the normal course of our business activities, we are exposed to a variety of risks.  The following is a discussion of various risk factors applicable to State Street.  Additional information about our risk management framework is included under ""Risk Management"" in Management's Discussion and Analysis included under Item 7 of this Form 10-K. Additional risks beyond those described in Management's Discussion and Analysis or in the following discussion may apply to our activities or operations as currently conducted, or as we may conduct them in the future, or in the markets in which we operate or may in the future operate. Credit and Counterparty, Liquidity and Market Risks We assume significant credit risk to counterparties, many of which are major financial institutions. These financial institutions and other counterparties may also have substantial financial dependencies with other financial institutions and sovereign entities. This credit exposure and concentration could expose us to financial loss. The financial markets are characterized by extensive interdependencies among numerous parties, including banks, central banks, broker/dealers, insurance companies and other financial institutions.  These financial institutions also include collective investment funds, such as mutual funds, UCITS and hedge funds that share these interdependencies.  Many financial institutions, including collective investment funds, also hold, or are exposed to, loans, sovereign debt, fixed-income securities, derivatives, counterparty and other forms of credit risk in amounts that are material to their financial condition.  As a result of our own business practices and these interdependencies, we and many of our clients have concentrated counterparty exposure to other financial institutions and collective investment funds, particularly large and complex institutions, sovereign issuers, mutual funds, UCITS and hedge funds.  Although we have procedures for monitoring both individual and aggregate counterparty risk, significant individual and aggregate counterparty exposure is inherent in our business, as our focus is on servicing large institutional investors. In the normal course of our business, we assume concentrated credit risk at the individual obligor, counterparty or group level.  Such concentrations may be material and can often exceed 10% of our consolidated total shareholders' equity.  Our material counterparty exposures change daily, and the counterparties or groups of related counterparties to which our risk exposure exceeds 10% of our consolidated total shareholders' equity are also variable during any reported period; however, our largest exposures tend to be to other financial institutions. Concentration of counterparty exposure presents significant risks to us and to our clients because the failure or perceived weakness of our counterparties (or in some cases of our clients' counterparties) has the potential to expose us to risk of financial loss.  Changes in market perception of the financial strength of particular financial institutions or sovereign issuers can occur rapidly, are often based on a variety of factors and are difficult to predict. This was observed during the financial crisis, when economic, market, political and other factors contributed to the perception of many financial institutions and sovereign issuers as being less credit worthy. This led to credit downgrades of numerous large U.S. and non-U.S. financial institutions and several sovereign issuers (which exposure stressed the perceived creditworthiness of financial institutions, many of which invest in, accept collateral in the form of, or value other transactions based on the debt or other securities issued by sovereigns). These or other factors could again contribute to similar consequences or other market risks associated with reduced levels of liquidity.  As a result, we may be exposed to increased counterparty risks, either resulting from our role as principal or because of commitments we make in our capacity as agent for some of our clients. Additional areas where we experience exposure to credit risk include:  Short-term credit. The degree of client demand for short-term credit tends to increase during periods of market turbulence, which may expose us to further counterparty- related risks.  For example, investors in collective investment vehicles for which we act as custodian may experience significant redemption activity due to adverse market or economic news.  Our relationship with our clients and the nature of the settlement process for some types of payments may result in the extension of short-term credit in such circumstances.  We also provide committed lines of credit to support such activity.  For some types of clients, we provide credit to allow them to leverage their portfolios, which may expose us to potential loss if the client experiences investment losses or other credit difficulties.  Industry and country risks. In addition to our exposure to financial institutions, we are from time to time exposed to concentrated credit risk at an industry or country level.  This concentration risk also applies to groups of unrelated counterparties that may have similar investment strategies involving one or more particular industries, regions, or other State Street Corporation | 20 Table of Contents characteristics.  These unrelated counterparties may concurrently experience adverse effects to their performance, liquidity or reputation due to events or other factors affecting such investment strategies.  Though potentially not material individually (relative to any one such counterparty), our credit exposures to such a group of counterparties could expose us to a single market or political event or a correlated set of events that, in the aggregate, could have a material adverse impact on our business.  Subcustodian risks. Our use of unaffiliated subcustodians exposes us to credit risk, in addition to other risks, such as operational risk, dependencies on credit extensions and risks of the legal systems of the jurisdictions in which the subcustodians operate, each of which may be material.  These risks are amplified due to changing regulatory requirements with respect to our financial exposures in the event those subcustodians are unable to return a client's assets, including, in some regulatory regimes, such as the E.U.'s UCITS and AIFM directives, requirements that we be responsible for resulting losses suffered by our clients.  Settlement risks. We are exposed to settlement risks, particularly in our payments and foreign exchange activities.  Those activities may lead to extension of credit and consequent losses in the event of a counterparty breach, failure to provide credit extensions or an operational error.  Due to our membership in several industry clearing or settlement exchanges, we may be required to guarantee obligations and liabilities, or provide financial support, in the event that other members do not honor their obligations or default.  Moreover, not all of our counterparty exposure is secured, and even when our exposure is secured, the realizable value of the collateral may have declined by the time we exercise our rights against that collateral.  This risk may be particularly acute if we are required to sell the collateral into an illiquid or temporarily-impaired market or with respect to clients protected by sovereign immunity.  We are exposed to risk of short-term credit or overdraft of our clients in connection with the process to facilitate settlement of trades and related foreign exchange activities, particularly when contractual settlement has been agreed with our clients.  The occurrence of overdrafts at peak volatility could create significant credit exposure to our clients depending upon the value of such clients' collateral at the time.  Securities lending and repurchase agreement indemnification. On behalf of clients enrolled in our securities lending program, we lend securities to banks, broker/dealers and other institutions.  In the event of a failure of the borrower to return such securities, we typically agree to indemnify our clients for the amount by which the fair market value of those securities exceeds the proceeds of the disposition of the collateral recalled from the borrower in connection with such transaction. We also lend and borrow securities as riskless principal, and in connection with those transactions receive a security interest in securities from the borrowers of securities and advances as collateral to securities lenders. Borrowers are generally required to provide collateral equal to a contractually agreed percentage equal to or in excess of the fair market value of the loaned securities.  As the fair market value of the loaned securities or collateral changes, additional collateral is provided by the borrower or collateral is returned to the borrower.  In addition, our agency securities lending clients often purchase securities or other financial instruments from financial counterparties, including broker/dealers, under repurchase arrangements, frequently as a method of reinvesting the cash collateral they receive from lending their securities.  Under these arrangements, the counterparty is obligated to repurchase these securities or financial instruments from the client at the same price (plus an agreed rate of return) at some point in the future.  The value of the collateral is intended to exceed the counterparty's payment obligation, and collateral is adjusted daily to account for shortfall under, or excess over, the agreed-upon collateralization level.  As with the securities lending program, we agree to indemnify our clients from any loss that would arise on a default by the counterparty under these repurchase arrangements if the proceeds from the disposition of the securities or other financial assets held as collateral are less than the amount of the repayment obligation by the client's counterparty.  In such instances of counterparty default, for both securities lending and repurchase agreements, we, rather than our client, are exposed to the risks associated with collateral value.  Stable value arrangements. We provide benefit-responsive contracts, known as wraps, to defined contribution plans that offer a stable value option to their participants.  During the financial crisis, the book value of State Street Corporation | 21 Table of Contents obligations under many of these contracts exceeded the market value of the underlying portfolio holdings.  Concerns regarding the portfolio of investments protected by such contracts, or regarding the investment manager overseeing such an investment option, may result in redemption demands from stable value products covered by benefit-responsive contracts at a time when the portfolio's market value is less than its book value, potentially exposing us to risk of loss.  U.S. municipal obligations remarketing credit facilities.  We provide credit facilities in connection with the remarketing of U.S. municipal obligations, potentially exposing us to credit exposure to the municipalities issuing such bonds and to their increased liquidity demands.  In the current economic environment, where municipalities are subject to increased investor concern, the risks associated with such businesses increase.  Senior secured bank loans. In recent years, we have increased our investment in senior secured bank loans, both in the U.S. and in Europe.  We invest in these loans to non-investment grade borrowers through participation in loan syndications in the non-investment grade lending market.  We rate these loans as ""speculative"" under our internal risk-rating framework, and these loans have significant exposure to credit losses relative to higher-rated loans.  We are therefore at a higher risk of default with respect to these investments relative to other of our investments activities.  In addition, unlike other financial institutions that may have an active role in managing individual loan compliance, our investment in these loans is generally as a passive investor with limited control.  As this portfolio grows and becomes more seasoned, our allowance for loan losses related to these loans may increase through additional provisions for credit losses.  Unavailability of netting. We are generally not able to net exposures across counterparties that are affiliated entities and may not be able in all circumstances to net exposures to the same legal entity across multiple products.  As a consequence, we may incur a loss in relation to one entity or product even though our exposure to an entity's affiliates or across product types is over-collateralized. Under evolving regulatory restrictions on credit exposure we may be required to limit our exposures to specific issuers or counterparties or groups of counterparties, including financial institutions and sovereign issuers, to levels that we may currently exceed.  These credit exposure restrictions under such evolving regulations may adversely affect our businesses, may require that we expand our credit exposure to a broader range of issuers and counterparties, including issuers and counterparties that represent increased credit risk and may require that we modify our operating models or the policies and practices we use to manage our consolidated statement of condition.  The effects of these considerations may increase when evaluated under a stressed environment in stress testing, including CCAR.  In addition, we are an adherent to the ISDA 2015 Universal Resolution Stay Protocol and as such are subject to restrictions against the exercise of rights and remedies against fellow adherents, including other major financial institutions, in the event they or an affiliate of theirs enters into resolution.  Although our overall business is subject to these factors, several of our activities are particularly sensitive to them, including our currency trading business and our securities finance business. Given the limited number of strong counterparties in the current market, we are not able to mitigate all of our and our clients' counterparty credit risk. Our investment securities portfolio, consolidated financial condition and consolidated results of operations could be adversely affected by changes in market factors including interest rates, credit spreads and credit performance. Our investment securities portfolio represented approximately 41% of our total assets as of December 31, 2017.  The gross interest income associated with our investment portfolio represented approximately 15% of our total gross revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017 and has represented as much as 30% of our total gross revenue in the fiscal years since 2007.  As such, our consolidated financial condition and results of operations are materially exposed to the risks associated with our investment portfolio, including, without limitation, changes in interest rates, credit spreads, credit performance (including risk of default), credit ratings, our access to liquidity, foreign exchange markets, mark- to-market valuations, and our ability to profitably manage changes in repayment rates of principal with respect to these securities.  Despite recent increases to interest rates in the U.S., the continued low interest-rate environment that has persisted since the financial crisis began in mid-2007 limits our ability to achieve a NIM consistent with our historical averages.  Any further increases in interest rates in the U.S. have the potential to improve NII and NIM over time. However, any such improvement could be mitigated due to a greater disparity between interest rates in the U.S. and international markets, especially to the extent that interest rates remain low State Street Corporation | 22 Table of Contents in Europe and Japan.  Higher interest rates could also reduce mark-to-market valuations further.  In addition, new and proposed regulatory liquidity standards, such as the LCR, require that we maintain minimum levels of high quality liquid assets in our investment portfolio, which generally generate lower rates of return than other investment assets. This has resulted in increased levels of high quality liquid assets as a percentage of our investment portfolio and an associated negative impact on our NII and our NIM.  As a result of this we may not be able to attain our historical levels of NII and NIM. For additional information regarding these liquidity requirements, refer to the ""Liquidity Coverage Ratio and Net Stable Funding Ratio"" section of ""Supervision and Regulation"" included under Item 1, Business, of this Form 10-K.  We may enter into derivative transactions to hedge or manage our exposure to interest rate risk, as well as other risks, such as foreign exchange risk and credit risk.  Derivative instruments that we hold for these or other purposes may not achieve their intended results and could result in unexpected losses or stresses on our liquidity or capital resources. Our investment securities portfolio represents a greater proportion of our consolidated statement of condition and our loan and lease portfolios represent a smaller proportion (approximately 10% of our total assets as of December 31, 2017), in comparison to many other major financial institutions.  In some respects, the accounting and regulatory treatment of our investment securities portfolio may be less favorable to us than a more traditional held-for-investment lending portfolio.  For example, under the Basel III final rule, after-tax changes in the fair value of AFS investment securities, such as those which represent a majority of our investment portfolio, are included in tier 1 capital.  Since loans held for investment are not subject to a fair value accounting framework, changes in the fair value of loans (other than incurred credit losses) are not similarly included in the determination of tier 1 capital under the Basel III final rule.  Due to this differing treatment, we may experience increased variability in our tier 1 capital relative to other major financial institutions whose loan-and-lease portfolios represent a larger proportion of their consolidated total assets than ours. Additional risks associated with our investment portfolio include:  Asset class concentration. Our investment portfolio continues to have significant concentrations in several classes of securities, including agency residential MBS, commercial MBS and other ABS, and securities with concentrated exposure to consumers.  These classes and types of securities experienced significant liquidity, valuation and credit quality deterioration during the financial crisis that began in mid-2007.  We also hold non-U.S. MBS and ABS with exposures to European countries, whose sovereign-debt markets have experienced increased stress at times since 2011 and may continue to experience stress in the future.  For further information, refer to the risk factor titled ""Our businesses have significant European operations, and disruptions in European economies could have an adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition"". Further, we hold a large portfolio of U.S. state and municipal bonds. In view of the budget deficits that a number of states and municipalities currently face, the risks associated with this portfolio are significant.  Effects of market conditions. If market conditions deteriorate, our investment portfolio could experience a decline in market value, whether due to a decline in liquidity or an increase in the yield required by investors to hold such securities, regardless of our credit view of our portfolio holdings.  For example, we recorded significant losses not related to credit in connection with the consolidation of our off-balance sheet asset-backed commercial paper conduits in 2009 and the repositioning of our investment portfolio in 2010.  In addition, in general, deterioration in credit quality, or changes in management's expectations regarding repayment timing or in management's investment intent to hold securities to maturity, in each case with respect to our portfolio holdings, could result in OTTI.  Similarly, if a material portion of our investment portfolio were to experience credit deterioration, our capital ratios as calculated pursuant to the Basel III final rule could be adversely affected.  This risk is greater with portfolios of investment securities that contain credit risk than with holdings of U.S. Treasury securities.  Effects of interest rates. Our investment portfolio is further subject to changes in both U.S. and non-U.S. (primarily in Europe) interest rates, and could be negatively affected by changes in those rates, whether or not expected.  This is particularly true in the case of a quicker-than-anticipated increase in interest rates, which would decrease market values in the near-term, or monetary policy that results in persistently low or negative rates of interest on certain investments.  The latter has been the case, for example, with respect to ECB monetary policy, including negative interest rates in State Street Corporation | 23 Table of Contents some jurisdictions, with associated negative effects on our investment portfolio reinvestment, NII and NIM.  The effect on our NII has been exacerbated by the effects in recent fiscal years, but not in 2017, of the strong U.S. dollar relative to other currencies, particularly the Euro.  If European interest rates remain low or decrease and the U.S. dollar strengthens relative to the Euro, the negative effects on our NII likely will continue or increase.  The overall level of NII can also be impacted by the size of our deposit base, as further increases in interest rates could lead to reduced deposit levels and also lower overall NII.  Further, a reduction in deposit levels could increase the requirements under the regulatory liquidity standards requiring us to invest a greater proportion of our investment portfolio holdings in high quality liquid assets that have lower yields than other investable assets.  See also, ""Our business activities expose us to interest-rate risk"" below. Our business activities expose us to interest-rate risk. In our business activities, we assume interest-rate risk by investing short-term deposits received from our clients in our investment portfolio of longer- and intermediate-term assets.  Our NII and NIM are affected by among other things, the levels of interest rates in global markets, changes in the relationship between short- and long-term interest rates, the direction and speed of interest-rate changes and the asset and liability spreads relative to the currency and geographic mix of our interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities.  These factors are influenced, among other things, by a variety of economic and market forces and expectations, including monetary policy and other activities of central banks, such as the Federal Reserve and ECB, that we do not control.  Our ability to anticipate changes in these factors or to hedge the related on- and off- balance sheet exposures, and the cost of any such hedging activity, can significantly influence the success of our asset-and-liability management activities and the resulting level of our NII and NIM.  The impact of changes in interest rates and related factors will depend on the relative duration and fixed- or floating- rate nature of our assets and liabilities.  Sustained lower interest rates, a flat or inverted yield curve and narrow credit spreads generally have a constraining effect on our NII.  In addition, our ability to change deposit rates in response to changes in interest rates and other market and related factors is limited by client relationship considerations.  For additional information about the effects on interest rates on our business, refer to ""Financial Condition - Market Risk Management - Asset-and-Liability Management Activities"" in Management's Discussion and Analysis included under Item 7 of this Form 10-K. If we are unable to effectively manage our liquidity, including by continuously attracting deposits and other short-term funding, our consolidated financial condition, including our regulatory capital ratios, our consolidated results of operations and our business prospects, could be adversely affected. Liquidity management, including on an intra-day basis, is critical to the management of our consolidated statement of condition and to our ability to service our client base.  We generally use our liquidity to:  meet clients' demands for return of their deposits;  extend credit to our clients in connection with our investor services businesses; and  fund the pool of long- and intermediate-term assets that are included in the investment securities carried in our consolidated statement of condition. Because the demand for credit by our clients is difficult to predict and control, and may be at its peak at times of disruption in the securities markets, and because the average maturity of our investment securities portfolio is longer than the contractual maturity of our client deposit base, we need to continuously attract, and are dependent on access to, various sources of short-term funding.  During periods of market disruption, the level of client deposits held by us has in recent years tended to increase; however, since such deposits are considered to be transitory, we have historically deposited so-called excess deposits with U.S. and non-U.S. central banks and in other highly liquid but low-yielding instruments.  These levels of excess client deposits, as a consequence, have increased our NII but have adversely affected our NIM. In managing our liquidity, our primary source of short-term funding is client deposits, which are predominantly transaction-based deposits by institutional investors.  Our ability to continue to attract these deposits, and other short-term funding sources such as certificates of deposit, is subject to variability based on a number of factors, including volume and volatility in global financial markets, the relative interest rates that we are prepared to pay for these deposits, the perception of safety of these deposits or short-term obligations relative to alternative short-term investments available to our clients, including the capital markets, and the classification of certain deposits for regulatory purposes and related discussions we may have from time to time with clients regarding better balancing our clients' cash management needs with our economic and regulatory objectives. State Street Corporation | 24 Table of Contents The Parent Company is a non-operating holding company and generally maintains only limited cash and other liquid resources at any time primarily to meet anticipated near-term obligations.  To effectively manage our liquidity we routinely transfer assets among affiliated entities, subsidiaries and branches.  Internal or external factors, such as regulatory requirements and standards, including resolution planning, influence our liquidity management and may limit our ability to effectively transfer liquidity internally which could, among other things, restrict our ability to fund operations, dividends or stock repurchases, require us to seek external and potentially more costly capital and impact our liquidity position. In addition, while not obligations of State Street, the investment products that we manage for third parties may be exposed to liquidity risks.  These products may be funded on a short-term basis, or the clients participating in these products may have a right to the return of cash or assets on limited notice.  These business activities include, among others, securities finance collateral pools, money market and other short-term investment funds and liquidity facilities utilized in connection with municipal bond programs.  If clients demand a return of their cash or assets, particularly on limited notice, and these investment pools do not have the liquidity to support those demands, we could be forced to sell investment securities held by these asset pools at unfavorable prices, damaging our reputation as an asset manager and potentially exposing us to claims related to our management of the pools. The availability and cost of credit in short-term markets are highly dependent on the markets' perception of our liquidity and creditworthiness.  Our efforts to monitor and manage our liquidity risk, including on an intra-day basis, may not be successful or sufficient to deal with dramatic or unanticipated changes in the global securities markets or other event-driven reductions in liquidity.  As a result of such events, among other things, our cost of funds may increase, thereby reducing our NII, or we may need to dispose of a portion of our investment securities portfolio, which, depending on market conditions, could result in a loss from such sales of investment securities being recorded in our consolidated statement of income. Our business and capital-related activities, including our ability to return capital to shareholders and purchase our capital stock, may be adversely affected by our implementation of regulatory capital and liquidity standards that we must meet or in the event our capital plan or post-stress capital ratios are determined to be insufficient as a result of regulatory capital stress testing. Basel III and Dodd-Frank Act We are required to calculate our risk-based capital ratios under both the Basel III advanced approaches and the Basel III standardized approach, and we are subject to the more stringent of the risk-based capital ratios calculated under the advanced approaches and those calculated under the standardized approach in the assessment of our capital adequacy. In implementing certain aspects of these capital regulations, we are making interpretations of the regulatory intent.  The Federal Reserve may determine that we are not in compliance with the capital rules and may require us to take actions to come into compliance that could adversely affect our business operations, our regulatory capital structure, our capital ratios or our financial performance, or otherwise restrict our growth plans or strategies.  In addition, banking regulators could change the Basel III final rule or their interpretations as they apply to us, including changes to these standards or interpretations made in regulations implementing provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act, which could adversely affect us and our ability to comply with the Basel III final rule. Along with the Basel III final rule, banking regulators also introduced additional requirements, such as the SLR, LCR and the proposed NSFR. For example, the specification of the various elements of the NSFR in the final rule could have a material effect on our business activities, including the management and composition of our investment securities portfolio and our ability to extend credit through committed facilities, loans to our clients or our principal securities lending activities.  In addition, further capital and liquidity requirements are under consideration by U.S. and international banking regulators.  Any of these rules could have a material effect on our capital and liquidity planning and related activities, including the management and composition of our investment securities portfolio and our ability to extend  committed contingent credit facilities to our clients.  The full effects of these rules, and of other regulatory initiatives related to capital or liquidity, on State Street and State Street Bank are subject to further regulatory guidance, action or rule-making. Systemic Importance As a G-SIB, we generally expect to be held to the most stringent provisions under the Basel III final rule.  For example, we are subject to the Federal Reserve's  final rules on the implementation of capital surcharges for U.S. G-SIBs, and on TLAC, LTD and clean holding company requirements for U.S. G-SIBs which we refer to as the ""TLAC final rule"".  For additional information on these requirements, refer to the ""Regulatory Capital Adequacy and Liquidity Standards"" section under ""Supervision and State Street Corporation | 25 Table of Contents Regulation"" included under Item 1, Business. of this Form 10-K. Not all of our competitors have similarly been designated as systemically important nor are all of them subject to the same degree of regulation as a bank or financial holding company, and therefore some of our competitors are not subject to the same additional capital requirements. CCAR We are required by the Federal Reserve to conduct periodic stress testing of our business operations and to develop an annual capital plan as part of the Federal Reserve's Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) process.  That process, the severity and other characteristics of which may evolve from year-to-year, is used by the Federal Reserve to evaluate our management of capital, the adequacy of our regulatory capital and the requirement for us to maintain capital above our minimum regulatory capital requirements under stressed economic conditions.  The results of the CCAR process are difficult to predict due, among other things, to the Federal Reserve's use of proprietary stress models that differ from our internal models.  The amounts of the planned capital actions in our capital plan in any year, including stock purchases and dividends, may be substantially reduced from the amounts included in prior capital plans. These reductions may reflect changes in one or more different factors, including but not limited to our business prospects and related capital needs, our capital position, proposed acquisitions or other uses of capital, the models used in our capital planning process, the supervisory models used by the Federal Reserve to stress our balance sheet, the Federal Reserve's hypothetical economic scenarios for the CCAR process, the Federal Reserve's CCAR instructions and the Federal Reserve's supervisory expectations for the capital planning process. The Federal Reserve may object to our capital plan, or we may decide that we need to adjust our capital plan to avoid an objection by the Federal Reserve, potentially requiring us, as applicable, to revise our stress-testing or capital management approaches, resubmit our capital plan or postpone, cancel or alter our planned capital actions.  In addition, changes in our business strategy, merger or acquisition activity or uses of capital could result in a change in our capital plan and its associated capital actions, and may require us to resubmit our capital plan to the Federal Reserve for its non-objection.  We are also subject to asset quality reviews and stress testing by the ECB and in the future we may be subject to similar reviews and testing by other regulators. Our implementation of capital and liquidity requirements, including our capital plan, may not be approved or may be objected to by the Federal Reserve, and the Federal Reserve may impose capital requirements in excess of our expectations or require us to maintain levels of liquidity that are higher than we may expect and which may adversely affect our consolidated revenues.  In the event that our implementation of capital and liquidity requirements under regulatory initiatives or our current capital structure are determined not to conform with current and future capital requirements, our ability to deploy capital in the operation of our business or our ability to distribute capital to shareholders or to purchase our capital stock may be constrained, and our business may be adversely affected.  In addition, we may choose to forgo business opportunities, due to their impact on our capital plan or stress tests, including CCAR. Likewise, in the event that regulators in other jurisdictions in which we have banking subsidiaries determine that our capital or liquidity levels do not conform with current and future regulatory requirements, our ability to deploy capital, our levels of liquidity or our business operations in those jurisdictions may be adversely affected. For additional information about the above matters, refer to ""Business - Supervision and Regulation - Regulatory Capital Adequacy and Liquidity Standards"" included under Item 1, Business, and ""Financial Condition - Capital"" in Management's Discussion and Analysis included under Item 7 of this Form 10-K. Fee revenue represents a significant majority of our consolidated revenue and is subject to decline, among other things, in the event of a reduction in, or changes to, the level or type of investment activity by our clients. We rely primarily on fee-based services to derive our revenue. This contrasts with commercial banks that may rely more heavily on interest-based sources of revenue, such as loans.  During 2017 total fee revenue represented approximately 80% of our total revenue.  Fee revenue generated by our investment servicing and investment management businesses is augmented by trading services, securities finance and processing fees and other revenue. The level of these fees is influenced by several factors, including the mix and volume of our AUCA and our AUM, the value and type of securities positions held (with respect to assets under custody) and the volume of portfolio transactions, and the types of products and services used by our clients.  For example, reductions in the level of economic and capital markets activity tend to have a negative effect on our fee revenue, as these often result in reduced asset valuations and transaction volumes.  They may also result in investor preference trends towards asset classes and markets deemed more secure, State Street Corporation | 26 Table of Contents such as cash or non-emerging markets, with respect to which our fee rates are often lower. In addition, our clients include institutional investors, such as mutual funds, collective investment funds, UCITS, hedge funds and other investment pools, corporate and public retirement plans, insurance companies, foundations, endowments and investment managers.  Economic, market or other factors that reduce the level or rates of savings in or with those institutions, either through reductions in financial asset valuations or through changes in investor preferences, could materially reduce our fee revenue and have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations. Our businesses have significant European operations, and disruptions in European economies could have an adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition. While the European economy made some progress towards recovery during 2017, concerns remain with regard to sovereign debt sustainability, interdependencies among financial institutions and sovereigns, the impacts of the British exit or potential other exits from the European Union, the planned unwinding of European Central Bank quantitative easing measures and political and other risks, such as relating to populism, refugee migration or terrorist threats, in one or more European nations.  In addition, both divergence between the pace of monetary tightening in the U.S. and Europe and the recent strength of the Euro have led to increased uncertainty around the sustainability of the economic progress made in 2017 in Europe.  Given the scope of our European operations, economic or market uncertainty, volatility, illiquidity or disruption resulting from these and related factors could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition. Geopolitical and economic conditions and developments could adversely affect us, particularly if we face increased uncertainty and unpredictability in managing our businesses. Global credit and other financial markets can suffer from substantial volatility, illiquidity and disruption, particularly in the wake of geopolitical disruptions and as global monetary authorities begin to withdraw monetary policy easing measures.  If such volatility, illiquidity or disruption were to result in an adverse economic environment in the U.S. or internationally or result in a lack of confidence in the financial stability of major developed and emerging markets, such developments could have an adverse affect on our business, as well as the businesses of our clients and our significant counterparties and could also increase the difficulty and unpredictability of aligning our business strategies, our infrastructure and our operating costs in light of current and future market and economic conditions.  These risks could be compounded by tighter monetary conditions, restrictions on free trade and political uncertainty in the U.S. and internationally. Market disruptions can adversely affect our consolidated results of operations if the value of AUCA or AUM decline, while the costs of providing the related services remain constant or increase.  These factors could reduce the profitability of our asset-based fee revenue and could also adversely affect our transaction-based revenue, such as revenues from securities finance and foreign exchange activities, and the volume of transactions that we execute for or with our clients.  Further, the degree of volatility in foreign exchange rates can affect our foreign exchange trading revenue.  In general, increased currency volatility tends to increase our market risk but also increases our opportunity to generate foreign exchange revenue.  Conversely, periods of lower currency volatility tend to decrease our market risk but also decrease our foreign exchange revenue. In addition, as our business grows globally and a significant percentage of our revenue is earned (and of our expenses paid) in currencies other than U.S. dollars, our exposure to foreign currency volatility could affect our levels of consolidated revenue, our consolidated expenses and our consolidated results of operations, as well as the value of our investment in our non-U.S. operations and our investment portfolio holdings.  The extent to which changes in the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies affect our consolidated results of operations, including the degree of any offset between increases or decreases to both revenue and expenses, will depend upon the nature and scope of our operations and activities in the relevant jurisdictions during the relevant periods, which may vary from period to period. As our product offerings expand, in part as we seek to take advantage of perceived opportunities arising under various regulatory reforms and resulting market changes, the degree of our exposure to various market and credit risks will evolve, potentially resulting in greater revenue volatility.  We also will need to make additional investments to develop the operational infrastructure and to enhance our compliance and risk management capabilities to support these businesses, which may increase the operating expenses of such businesses or, if our control environment fails to keep pace with product expansion, result in increased risk of loss from such businesses. State Street Corporation | 27 Table of Contents We may need to raise additional capital or debt in the future, which may not be available to us or may only be available on unfavorable terms. We may need to raise additional capital in order to maintain our credit ratings, in response to regulatory changes, including capital rules, or for other purposes, including financing acquisitions and joint ventures.  In particular, the Federal Reserve's TLAC final rule, which goes into effect on January 1, 2019, will require State Street to maintain a minimum amount of eligible LTD outstanding, and we may need to issue more long-term debt in order to meet the minimum eligible LTD requirement. However, our ability to access the capital markets, if needed, on a timely basis or at all will depend on a number of factors, such as the state of the financial markets and securities law requirements and standards.  In the event of rising interest rates, disruptions in financial markets, negative perceptions of our business or our financial strength, or other factors that would increase our cost of borrowing, we cannot be sure of our ability to raise additional capital, if needed, on terms acceptable to us.  Any diminished ability to raise additional capital, if needed, could adversely affect our business and our ability to implement our business plan, capital plan and strategic goals, including the financing of acquisitions and joint ventures and our efforts to maintain regulatory compliance. Any downgrades in our credit ratings, or an actual or perceived reduction in our financial strength, could adversely affect our borrowing costs, capital costs and liquidity and cause reputational harm. Major independent rating agencies publish credit ratings for our debt obligations based on their evaluation of a number of factors, some of which relate to our performance and other corporate developments, including financings, acquisitions and joint ventures, and some of which relate to general industry conditions.  We anticipate that the rating agencies will continue to review our ratings regularly based on our consolidated results of operations and developments in our businesses, including regulatory considerations such as resolution planning.  One or more of the major independent credit rating agencies have in the past downgraded, and may in the future downgrade, our credit ratings, or have negatively revised their outlook for our credit ratings.  The current market and regulatory environment and our exposure to financial institutions and other counterparties, including sovereign entities, increase the risk that we may not maintain our current ratings, and we cannot provide assurance that we will continue to maintain our current credit ratings.  Downgrades in our credit ratings may adversely affect our borrowing costs, our capital costs and our ability to raise capital and, in turn, our liquidity.  A failure to maintain an acceptable credit rating may also preclude us from being competitive in various products. Additionally, our counterparties, as well as our clients, rely on our financial strength and stability and evaluate the risks of doing business with us.  If we experience diminished financial strength or stability, actual or perceived, including the effects of market or regulatory developments, our announced or rumored business developments or consolidated results of operations, a decline in our stock price or a reduced credit rating, our counterparties may be less willing to enter into transactions, secured or unsecured, with us; our clients may reduce or place limits on the level of services we provide them or seek other service providers; or our prospective clients may select other service providers, all of which may have adverse effects on our reputation. The risk that we may be perceived as less creditworthy relative to other market participants is higher in the current market environment, in which the consolidation, and in some instances failure, of financial institutions, including major global financial institutions, have resulted in a smaller number of much larger counterparties and competitors. If our counterparties perceive us to be a less viable counterparty, our ability to enter into financial transactions on terms acceptable to us or our clients, on our or our clients' behalf, will be materially compromised.  If our clients reduce their deposits with us or select other service providers for all or a portion of the services we provide to them, our revenues will decrease accordingly. Operational, Business and Reputational Risks We face extensive and changing government regulation in the U.S. and in foreign jurisdictions in which we operate, which may increase our costs and expose us to risks related to compliance. Most of our businesses are subject to extensive regulation by multiple regulatory bodies, and many of the clients to which we provide services are themselves subject to a broad range of regulatory requirements.  These regulations may affect the scope of, and the manner and terms of delivery of, our services.  As a financial institution with substantial international operations, we are subject to extensive regulation and supervisory oversight, both inside and outside of the U.S.  This regulation and supervisory oversight affects, among other things, the scope of our activities and client services, our capital and organizational structure, our ability to fund the operations of our subsidiaries, our lending practices, our dividend policy, our common stock purchase actions, the manner in which we market our services, our acquisition activities and our interactions with State Street Corporation | 28 Table of Contents foreign regulatory agencies and officials. In particular, State Street is registered with the Federal Reserve as a bank holding company pursuant to the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956.  The Bank Holding Company Act generally limits the activities in which we and our non-banking subsidiaries may engage to managing or controlling banks and to activities considered to be closely related to banking.  As a bank holding company that has elected to be treated as a financial holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act, State Street and some of our non-banking subsidiaries may also engage in a broader range of activities considered to be ""financial in nature."" Financial holding company status may be denied if State Street and its banking subsidiaries do not remain well capitalized and well managed or fail to comply with Community Reinvestment Act obligations.  Currently, under the Bank Holding Company Act, we may not be able to engage in new activities or acquire shares or control of other businesses. The U.S. President has issued an executive order that sets forth principles for the reform of the federal financial regulatory framework, and the Republican majority in Congress has also suggested an agenda for financial regulatory reform. It is too early to assess whether there will be any major changes in the regulatory environment or a rebalancing of the post financial crisis framework and what the impact will be on our results of operations or financial condition, including, without limitation, increased expenses or changes in the demand for our services, or on the U.S.-domestic or global economies or financial markets.  We expect that our business will remain subject to extensive regulation and supervision.  Several other aspects of the regulatory environment in which we operate, and related risks, are discussed below.  Additional information is provided under ""Supervision and Regulation"" included under Item 1, Business, of this Form 10-K. Resolution Planning State Street, like other bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of $50 billion or more, periodically submits a plan for rapid and orderly resolution in the event of material financial distress or failure commonly referred to as a resolution plan or a living will to the Federal Reserve and the FDIC under Section 165(d) of the Dodd-Frank Act.  Through resolution planning, we seek, in the event of insolvency, to maintain State Street Bank's role as a key infrastructure provider within the financial system, while minimizing risk to the financial system and maximizing value for the benefit of our stakeholders.  Significant management attention and resources are required in an effort to meet regulatory expectations with respect to resolution planning. In the event of material financial distress or failure, our preferred resolution strategy is the SPOE Strategy.  Our resolution plan, including our implementation of the SPOE strategy with a secured support agreement, involves important risks, including that: (1) the SPOE Strategy and the obligations under the support agreement may result in the recapitalization of State Street Bank and the commencement of bankruptcy proceedings by the Parent Company at an earlier stage of financial stress than might otherwise occur without such mechanisms in place; (2) an expected effect of the SPOE Strategy, together with applicable TLAC regulatory requirements, is that State Street's losses will be imposed on Parent Company shareholders and the holders of long-term debt and other forms of TLAC securities currently outstanding or issued in the future by the Parent Company, as well as on any other Parent Company creditors, before any of its losses are imposed on the holders of the debt securities of certain of the Parent Company's operating subsidiaries or any of their depositors or creditors or before U.S. taxpayers are put at risk; (3) there can be no assurance that there would be sufficient recapitalization resources available to ensure that State Street Bank and our other material entities are adequately capitalized following the triggering of the requirements to provide capital and/or liquidity under the support agreement; and (4) there can be no assurance that credit rating agencies, in response to our resolution plan or the support agreement, will not downgrade, place on negative watch or change their outlook on our debt credit ratings, generally or on specific debt securities. Additional information about the SPOE Strategy, including related risks, is provided under ""Resolution Planning"" included under Item 1, Business, of this Form 10-K. Systemic Importance Our qualification in the U.S. as a SIFI, and our designation by the FSB as a G-SIB, to which certain regulatory capital surcharges may apply subjects us to incrementally higher capital and prudential requirements, increased scrutiny of our activities and potential further regulatory requirements or increased regulatory expectations than those applicable to some of the financial institutions with which we compete as a custodian or asset manager.  This qualification and designation also has significantly increased, and may continue to increase, our expenses associated with regulatory compliance, including personnel and systems, as well as implementation and related costs to enhance our programs. Global and Non-U.S. Regulatory Requirements The breadth of our business activities, together with the scope of our global operations and varying State Street Corporation | 29 Table of Contents business practices in relevant jurisdictions, increase the complexity and costs of meeting our regulatory compliance obligations, including in areas that are receiving significant regulatory scrutiny.  We are, therefore, subject to related risks of non-compliance, including fines, penalties, lawsuits, regulatory sanctions, difficulties in obtaining governmental approvals, limitations on our business activities or reputational harm, any of which may be significant. For example, the global nature of our client base requires us to comply with complex laws and regulations of multiple jurisdictions relating to economic sanctions and money laundering.  In addition, we are required to comply not only with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, but also with the applicable anti-corruption laws of other jurisdictions in which we operate.  Further, our global operating model requires we comply with outsourcing oversight requirements, including with respect to affiliated entities, and data security standards of multiple jurisdictions.  Regulatory scrutiny of compliance with these and other laws and regulations is increasing. State Street faces sometimes inconsistent laws and regulations across the various jurisdictions in which we operate.  The evolving regulatory landscape may interfere with our ability to conduct our operations, with our pursuit of a common global operating model or with our ability to compete effectively with other financial institutions operating in those jurisdictions or which may be subject to different regulatory requirements than apply to us. In particular, non-U.S. regulations and initiatives that may be inconsistent or conflict with current or proposed regulations in the U.S. could create increased compliance and other costs that would adversely affect our business, operations or profitability.  Geopolitical events such as the U.K.'s planned exit from the European Union also have the potential to increase the complexity and cost of regulatory compliance. In addition to U.S. regulatory initiatives we are further affected by non-U.S. regulatory initiatives, including, but not limited to, the AIFMD, the BRRD, the EMIR, GDPR, the UCITS directives, the Money Market Funds Regulation, MiFID II and MiFIR and the proposed E.U. risk reduction package. Recent, proposed or potential regulations in the U.S. and E.U. with respect to money market funds, short-term wholesale funding, such as repurchase agreements or securities lending, or other ""shadow banking"" activities, could also adversely affect not only our own operations but also the operations of the clients to which we provide services.  In the E.U., the AIFMD and UCITS V increase the responsibilities and potential liabilities of custodians and depositories to certain of their clients for asset losses. EMIR requires the reporting of all derivatives to a trade repository, the mandatory clearing of certain derivatives trades via a central counterparty (including the exchange of margin) and risk mitigation techniques for derivatives not cleared via a central counterparty. State Street is likely to become indirectly subject to EMIR's risk mitigation obligations when it transacts with E.U. counterparties.  EMIR will continue to impact our business activities, and increase costs, in various ways, some of which may be adverse.  Further, the European Commission's proposal to introduce a proposed financial transaction tax or similar proposals elsewhere, if adopted, could materially affect the location and volume of financial transactions or otherwise alter the conduct of financial activities, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition. Consequences of Regulatory Environment and Compliance Risks Domestic and international regulatory reform could limit our ability to pursue certain business opportunities, increase our regulatory capital requirements, alter the risk profile of certain of our core activities and impose additional costs on us, otherwise adversely affect our business, our consolidated results of operations or financial condition and have other negative consequences, including a reduction of our credit ratings.  Different countries may respond to the market and economic environment in different and potentially conflicting manners, which could increase the cost of compliance for us. The evolving regulatory environment, including changes to existing regulations and the introduction of new regulations, may also contribute to decisions we may make to suspend, reduce or withdraw from existing businesses, activities, markets or initiatives.  In addition to potential lost revenue associated with any such suspensions, reductions or withdrawals, any such suspensions, reductions or withdrawals may result in significant restructuring or related costs or exposures. If we do not comply with governmental regulations, we may be subject to fines, penalties, lawsuits, delays, or difficulties in obtaining regulatory approvals or restrictions on our business activities or harm to our reputation, which may significantly and adversely affect our business operations and, in turn, our consolidated results of operations.  The willingness of regulatory authorities to impose meaningful sanctions, and the level of fines and penalties imposed in connection with regulatory violations, have increased substantially since the financial crisis.  Regulatory agencies may, at times, limit our ability to disclose their findings, related actions or remedial measures.  Similarly, many of our clients are subject to significant regulatory requirements and retain our services in order for us to assist them in complying with those legal State Street Corporation | 30 Table of Contents requirements.  Changes in these regulations can significantly affect the services that we are asked to provide, as well as our costs. Adverse publicity and damage to our reputation arising from the failure or perceived failure to comply with legal, regulatory or contractual requirements could affect our ability to attract and retain clients.  If we cause clients to fail to comply with these regulatory requirements, we may be liable to them for losses and expenses that they incur.  In recent years, regulatory oversight and enforcement have increased substantially, imposing additional costs and increasing the potential risks associated with our operations.  If this regulatory trend continues, it could continue to adversely affect our operations and, in turn, our consolidated results of operations and financial condition. For additional information, see the risk factor below, ""Our businesses may be adversely affected by government enforcement and litigation."" Our calculations of credit, market and operational risk exposures, total risk-weighted assets and capital ratios for regulatory purposes depend on data inputs, formulae, models, correlations and assumptions that are subject to changes over time, which changes, in addition to our consolidated financial results, could materially impact our risk exposures, our total risk- weighted assets and our capital ratios from period to period. To calculate our credit, market and operational risk exposures, our total risk-weighted assets and our capital ratios for regulatory purposes, the Basel III final rule involves the use of current and historical data, including our own loss data and similar information from other industry participants, market volatility measures, interest rates and spreads, asset valuations, credit exposures and the creditworthiness of our counterparties.  These calculations also involve the use of quantitative formulae, statistical models, historical correlations and significant assumptions.  We refer to the data, formulae, models, correlations and assumptions, as well as our related internal processes, as our ""advanced systems.""  While our advanced systems are generally quantitative in nature, significant components involve the exercise of judgment based, among other factors, on our and the financial services industry's evolving experience.  Any of these judgments or other elements of our advanced systems may not, individually or collectively, precisely represent or calculate the scenarios, circumstances, outputs or other results for which they are designed or intended.  Collectively, they represent only our estimate of associated risk. In addition, our advanced systems are subject to update and periodic revalidation in response to changes in our business activities and our historical experiences, forces and events experienced by the market broadly or by individual financial institutions, changes in regulations and regulatory interpretations and other factors, and are also subject to continuing regulatory review and approval.  For example, a significant operational loss experienced by another financial institution, even if we do not experience a related loss, could result in a material change in the output of our advanced systems and a corresponding material change in our risk exposures, our total risk-weighted assets and our capital ratios compared to prior periods.  An operational loss that we experience could also result in a material change in our capital requirements for operational risk under the advanced approaches, depending on the severity of the loss event, its characterization among the seven Basel-defined UOMs, and the stability of the distributional approach for a particular UOM, and without direct correlation to the effects of the loss event, or the timing of such effects, on our results of operations.  Due to the influence of changes in our advanced systems, whether resulting from changes in data inputs, regulation or regulatory supervision or interpretation, State Street-specific or more general market, or individual financial institution-specific, activities or experiences, or other updates or factors, we expect that our advanced systems and our credit, market and operational risk exposures, our total risk- weighted assets and our capital ratios calculated under the Basel III final rule will change, and may be volatile, over time, and that those latter changes or volatility could be material as calculated and measured from period to period. We are subject to enhanced external oversight as a result of certain agreements entered into in connection with the resolution of prior regulatory or governmental matters. In June 2015, we entered into a written agreement with the Federal Reserve and the Massachusetts Division of Banks relating to deficiencies identified in our compliance programs with the requirements of the Bank Secrecy Act, AML regulations and U.S. economic sanctions regulations promulgated by OFAC.  As part of this agreement, we have been required to, among other things, implement improvements to our compliance programs and to retain an independent firm to conduct a review of account and transaction activity to evaluate whether any suspicious activity was not previously reported. Separately, in connection with the resolution of certain proceedings relating to our having charged six clients of our U.K. transition management business during 2010 and 2011 amounts in excess of the contractual terms, in January 2017, we entered into a deferred prosecution agreement with the Department of Justice and the United States Attorney for the District of Massachusetts under which we agreed to State Street Corporation | 31 Table of Contents retain an independent compliance and ethics monitor for a term of three years (subject to extension) who will, among other things, review and monitor the effectiveness of our compliance controls and business ethics and make related recommendations, and in September 2017, we entered into a settlement agreement with the SEC that also requires us to retain an independent ethics and compliance consultant for a one year period.  We have retained a monitor who is fulfilling our obligations under both the deferred prosecution agreement and the SEC settlement.  Under the deferred prosecution agreement we also have a heightened obligation promptly to report issues involving potential or alleged fraudulent activities to the Department of Justice. As a result of the enhanced inspections and monitoring activities to which we are subject under these agreements, governmental authorities may identify areas in which we may need to take actions, which may be significant, to enhance our regulatory compliance or risk management practices. Such remedial actions may entail significant cost, management attention, and systems development and such efforts may affect our ability to expand our business until such remedial actions are completed.   These actions may be in addition to remedial measures required by the Federal Reserve and other financial regulators following examinations as a result of increased prudential expectations regarding our compliance programs, culture and risk management.   Our failure to implement enhanced compliance and risk management procedures in a manner and in a time frame deemed to be responsive by the applicable regulatory authority could adversely impact our relationship with such regulatory authority and could lead to restrictions on our activities or other sanctions.  Moreover, the identification of new or additional facts and circumstances suggesting inappropriate or non-compliant conduct, whether identified by the monitor or a regulatory authority, in the course of an inspection, or independently by us could lead to new governmental proceedings or the re-opening of matters that were previously resolved.  The presence of the monitor, as well as governmental programs rewarding whistleblowing, may also increase the instances of current or former employees alleging that certain practices are inconsistent with our legal or regulatory obligations. Our businesses may be adversely affected by government enforcement and litigation. The businesses in which we operate are highly-regulated and subject to extensive external scrutiny that may be directed generally to participants in the businesses or markets in which we are involved or may be specifically directed at us, including as a result of whistleblower and qui tam claims.  In the course of our business, we are frequently subject to various regulatory, governmental and law enforcement inquiries, investigative demands and subpoenas, and from time to time, our clients, or the government on its own behalf or on behalf of our clients or others, make claims and take legal action relating to, among other things, our performance of our fiduciary, contractual or regulatory responsibilities. Often, the announcement of any such matters, or of any settlement of a claim or action, whether it involves us or others in our industry, may spur the initiation of similar claims by other clients or governmental parties.  Regulatory authorities have, and are likely to continue to, initiate cross industry reviews when a material issue is identified at a financial institution.  Such inquiries involve costs and management time and may lead to proceedings relating to our own activities. Regardless of the outcome of any governmental enforcement or litigation matter, responding to such matters is time-consuming and expensive and can divert the attention of senior management.  Governmental enforcement and litigation matters can involve claims for disgorgement, demands for substantial monetary damages, the imposition of civil or criminal penalties, and the imposition of remedial sanctions or other required changes in our business practices, any of which could result in increased expenses, loss of client demand for our products or services, or harm to our reputation. The exposure associated with any proceedings that may be threatened, commenced or filed against us could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations for the period in which we establish a reserve with respect to such potential liability or upon our reputation. In government settlements since the financial crisis, the fines imposed by authorities have increased substantially and may exceed in some cases the profit earned or harm caused by the regulatory or other breach.  For example, in connection with the resolution of the U.K. transition management matter, we agreed to pay a fine of £22.9 million (approximately $37.8 million) to the FCA in 2014 and fines of $32.3 million to each of the Department of Justice and the SEC in 2017.  As a further example, we paid an aggregate of $575 million in 2016 to resolve a series of investigations and governmental and private claims alleging that our indirect foreign exchange rates prior to 2008 were not adequately disclosed or were otherwise improper.  These matters have also resulted in regulatory focus on the manner in which we charge clients and related disclosures.  This focus may lead to increased and prolonged governmental inquiries and client, qui tam and whistleblower claims associated with the amount and disclosure of compensation we receive for our products and services. Moreover, U.S and certain international governmental authorities have increasingly brought criminal actions against financial institutions, and State Street Corporation | 32 Table of Contents criminal prosecutors have increasingly sought and obtained criminal guilty pleas, deferred prosecution agreements or other criminal sanctions from financial institutions. For example, in 2017 we entered into a deferred prosecution agreement with the U.S. Department of Justice in connection with the resolution of the U.K transition management matter, and such agreement could increase the likelihood that governmental authorities will seek criminal sanctions against us in pending or future legal proceedings. See ""We are subject to various legal proceedings relating to the manner in which we have invoiced certain expenses, and the outcome of such proceedings could materially adversely affect our results of operations or harm our business or reputation."" In many cases, we are required or may choose to report inappropriate or non-compliant conduct to the authorities, and our failure or delay to do so may represent an independent regulatory violation or be treated as an indication of non-cooperation with governmental authorities. Even when we promptly report a matter, we may nonetheless experience regulatory fines, liabilities to clients, harm to our reputation or other adverse effects.  Moreover, our settlement or other resolution of any matter with any one or more regulators or other applicable party may not forestall other regulators or parties in the same or other jurisdictions from pursuing a claim or other action against us with respect to the same or a similar matter. For more information about current contingencies relating to legal proceedings, see Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements included under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Form 10-K. The resolution of certain pending or potential legal or regulatory matters could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations for the period in which the relevant matter is resolved or an accrual is determined to be required, on our consolidated financial condition or on our reputation. In view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of legal and regulatory matters, we cannot provide assurance as to the outcome of any pending or potential matter or, if determined adversely against us, the costs associated with any such matter, particularly where the claimant seeks very large or indeterminate damages or where the matter presents novel legal theories, involves a large number of parties, involves the discretion of governmental authorities in seeking sanctions or negotiated resolution or is at a preliminary stage. We may be unable to accurately estimate our exposure to the risks of legal and regulatory contingencies when we record reserves for probable and estimable loss contingencies. As a result, any reserves we establish may not be sufficient to cover our actual financial exposure. Similarly, our estimates of the aggregate range of reasonably possible loss for legal and regulatory contingencies are based upon then-available information and are subject to significant judgment and a variety of assumptions and known and unknown uncertainties.  The matters underlying the estimated range will change from time to time, and actual results may vary significantly from the estimate at any time. We are subject to various legal proceedings relating to the manner in which we have invoiced certain expenses, and the outcome of such proceedings could materially adversely affect our results of operations, or harm our business or reputation. In December 2015, we announced a review of the manner in which we invoiced certain expenses to some of our Investment Servicing clients, primarily in the United States, during an 18-year period going back to 1998, and our determination that we had incorrectly invoiced clients for certain expenses. We informed our clients in December 2015 that we will pay to them the amounts we concluded were incorrectly invoiced to them, plus interest. We currently expect the cumulative total of our payments to customers for these matters to be at least $360 million, in connection with that review, which is ongoing. We are implementing enhancements to our billing processes, see ""Our efforts to improve our billing processes and practices are ongoing and are likely to result in the identification of additional billing errors.""  We are reviewing the conduct of our employees with respect to billing matters and have taken steps to address conduct with respect to such matters that we believe is inconsistent with our standards, including, in some cases, termination of employment. We are also evaluating other billing practices relating to our Investment Servicing clients. We have received a purported class action demand letter alleging that our invoicing practices were unfair and deceptive under Massachusetts law. A class of customers, or particular customers, may assert that we have not paid to them all amounts incorrectly invoiced, and may seek double or treble damages under Massachusetts law. In addition, in March 2017, a purported class action was commenced against us alleging that our invoicing practices violated duties owed to retirement plan customers under ERISA. We are also responding to requests for information from, and are cooperating with investigations by, governmental and regulatory authorities on these matters, including the civil and criminal divisions of the DOJ, the SEC, the DOL, the Massachusetts Attorney General, and the New Hampshire Bureau of Securities Regulation, which could result in significant fines or other sanctions, civil and criminal, against us. If these governmental or State Street Corporation | 33 Table of Contents regulatory authorities were to conclude that all or a portion of the billing error merited civil or criminal sanctions, any fine or other penalty could be a significant percentage or a multiple of the portion of the overcharging serving as the basis of such a claim or of the full amount of the overcharging. The governmental and regulatory authorities have significant discretion in civil and criminal matters as to the fines and other penalties they seek to impose. The severity of such fines or other penalties could take into account factors such as the amount and duration of our incorrect invoicing, the government's or regulator's assessment of the conduct of our employees, as well as prior conduct such as that which resulted in our January 2017 deferred prosecution agreement in connection with U.K. transition management matter and our recent settlement of civil claims regarding our indirect foreign exchange business. The outcome of any of these proceedings and, in particular, any criminal sanction could materially adversely affect our results of operations and could have significant collateral consequences for our business and reputation. Our efforts to improve our billing processes and practices are ongoing and are likely to result in the identification of additional billing errors. In 2015, we determined that we had made errors in billing our asset servicing customers, principally in the United States.  In 2016, we began the process of remediating these errors, improving our billing processes and controls in the asset servicing business and other businesses, and testing these improved billing processes and controls.  As a result of such review, we may modify, enhance, and, where necessary, replace our existing global billing processes  and implement and test controls for the new system.  The objectives of this billing transformation process are to obtain greater billing accuracy and consistency across business lines.  Our goal is for this billing transformation process to be completed in 2019, but there can be no assurance as to when we will complete this process or that it will allow us to meet the objectives we have set for it.  Because of the scale of our business, implementing enhanced billing controls will be expensive and time consuming, may not succeed in identifying and remediating all weaknesses and  inefficiencies in our billing processes and cannot be implemented in all our business units concurrently.   Accordingly, the costs of the billing transformation process, and the costs to remediate billing errors which may be discovered in that process, would likely be incurred over a period that we are now unable accurately to determine.  As we work through this process, we have discovered and may continue to discover areas where we believe our billing processes need improvement, where we believe we have made billing errors with respect to particular customers and categories of fees and expenses, and where we believe billing arrangements between ourselves and particular customers should be clarified.  Such discoveries may lead to increased expense and decreased revenues, the need to remediate prior billing errors, government investigations, or litigation that may materially impact our business, financial results and reputation. We are subject to variability in our assets under custody and administration and assets under management, and in our financial results, due to the significant size of many of our institutional clients, and are also subject to significant pricing pressure due to the considerable market influence exerted by those clients. Our clients include institutional investors, such as mutual funds, collective investment funds, UCITS, hedge funds and other investment pools, corporate and public retirement plans, insurance companies, foundations, endowments and investment managers. In both our asset servicing and asset management businesses, we endeavor to attract institutional investors controlling large and diverse pools of assets, as those clients typically have the opportunity to benefit from the full range of our expertise and service offerings.  Due to the large pools of assets controlled by these clients, the loss or gain of one client, or even a portion of the assets controlled by one client, could have a significant effect on our AUCA or our AUM, as applicable, in the relevant period.  Loss of all or a portion of the servicing of a client's assets can occur for a variety of reasons, including client decision or diversification of service providers or acquisition or restructuring activity affecting a client.  For example, as previously reported, as a result of a decision to diversify providers, one of our large clients will move a portion of its assets, largely common trust funds, currently with State Street to another provider.  The transition will principally occur in 2018 and beyond and represents approximately $1 trillion in assets with respect to which we will no longer derive revenue post-transition.  Our AUM or AUCA are also affected by decisions by institutional owners to favor or disfavor certain investment instruments or categories.  Similarly, if one or more clients changes the asset class in which a significant portion of assets are invested (e.g., by shifting investments from emerging markets to the U.S.), those changes could have a significant effect on our results of operations in the relevant period, as our fee rates often change based on the type of asset classes we are servicing or managing.  For example, in 2017 several industry-wide trends continued to impact AUCA and AUM asset levels.  Those trends included continued client redemptions out of hedge funds, as to which fees are generally higher, as well as strong retail flows from State Street Corporation | 34 Table of Contents mutual funds into ETFs, as to which fees are generally lower.  As our fee revenue is largely reliant on the levels of our AUCA and AUM, these changes in levels of differing asset types could have a corresponding significant effect on our results of operations in the relevant period.  Large institutional clients also, by their nature, are often able to exert considerable market influence, and this, combined with strong competitive forces in the markets for our services, has resulted in, and may continue to result in, significant pressure to reduce the fees we charge for our services in both our asset servicing and asset management lines of business.  Many of these large clients are also under competitive and regulatory pressures that are driving them to manage the expenses that they and their investment products incur more aggressively, which in turn exacerbates their pressures on our fees. Our business may be negatively affected by adverse business decisions or our failure to properly implement or execute strategic programs and priorities. In order to maintain and grow our business, we must make strategic decisions about our current and future business plans, including plans to target cost initiatives and enhance operational processes and efficiencies, plans to improve existing and to develop new service offerings and enhancements, plans to enhance existing and develop new information technology and other systems, migrate from existing systems and other infrastructure and to address staffing needs, plans for entering or exiting business lines or geographic markets and plans for acquiring or disposing of businesses. In late 2015, we announced Beacon, a multi-year program to create cost efficiencies through changes in our operational processes and to further digitize our processes and interfaces with our clients.  We anticipate we will undertake additional strategic initiatives of varying sizes, some of which may be material.  Operational process and information technology transformations, such as Beacon and future strategic initiatives we may undertake, entail significant risks.  The program, and any future strategic initiatives we implement, may prove to be inadequate to achieve its objectives, may not be responsive to industry, technological or market changes, may result in increased or unanticipated costs, may result in earnings volatility, may take longer than anticipated to implement, may involve elements reliant on the performance of third parties and may not be successfully implemented or meet client expectations.  In addition, our efforts to manage expenses may be matched or exceeded by our competitors.  Any failure to implement Beacon or any other strategic initiative we may undertake, in whole or in part may, among other things, reduce our competitive position, diminish the cost effectiveness of our systems and processes or provide an insufficient return on our associated investment.  In particular, elements of many initiatives include investment in systems integration and new technologies and also the development of new, and the evolution of existing, methods and tools to accelerate the pace of innovation, the introduction of new services and enhancements to the security of our data systems.  The transition to new operating processes and technology infrastructure may cause disruptions in our relationships with clients and employees and may present other unanticipated technical or operational hurdles.  In addition, the relocation or expansion of servicing activities and other operations to different geographic regions requires that client, regulatory and other third party data use, storage and security challenges, as well as other regulatory compliance other considerations, be resolved.  As a result, we may not achieve some or all of the cost savings or other benefits anticipated by the relevant strategic initiative and may experience unanticipated challenges from clients, regulators or other parties or reputational harm.  In addition, other systems development initiatives, which are not included in Beacon, may not have access to the same level of resources or management attention and, consequently, may be delayed or unsuccessful.  Many of our systems require enhancements to meet the requirements of evolving regulation, to permit us to optimize our use of capital or to reduce the risk of operating error.  We may not have the resources to pursue all of these objectives, including Beacon and any other strategic initiatives, simultaneously. The success of the program and our other strategic plans could also be affected by market disruptions and unanticipated changes in the overall market for financial services and the global economy.  We also may not be able to abandon or alter these plans without significant loss, as the implementation of our decisions may involve significant capital outlays, often far in advance of when we expect to generate any related revenues or cost expectations.  Accordingly, our business, our consolidated results of operations and our consolidated financial condition may be adversely affected by any failure or delay in our strategic decisions, including the program or elements thereof.  For additional information about the program, see ""Expenses"" in ""Consolidated Results of Operations"" included under Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis, of this form 10-K. Cost shifting to non-U.S. jurisdictions and outsourcing may expose us to increased operational risk and reputational harm and may not result in expected cost savings. We manage expenses by migrating certain business processes and business support functions to lower-cost geographic locations, such as India, State Street Corporation | 35 Table of Contents Poland and China, and by outsourcing to vendors and joint ventures.  We may accomplish this shift by establishing or increasing our level of activity at operations in lower-cost locations, by outsourcing to vendors in various jurisdictions or through joint ventures.  This effort exposes us to the risk that we may not maintain service quality, control or effective management and/or business resiliency within these operations during and after transition, These migrations also involve risks that our outsourcing vendors or joint ventures may not comply with their servicing and other contractual obligations to us, including with respect to indemnification and information security, and to the risk that we may not satisfy applicable regulatory responsibilities regarding the management and oversight of third parties and outsourcing providers.  Diversification of our geographic footprint also exposes us to the relevant macroeconomic, political, legal and similar risks generally involved in doing business in the jurisdictions in which we establish lower-cost locations or joint ventures or in which our outsourcing vendors locate their operations.  The increased elements of risk that arise from certain operating processes being conducted in some jurisdictions could lead to an increase in reputational risk.  During periods of transition of operations, greater operational risk and client concern exist with respect to maintaining a high level of service delivery and business resiliency.  The extent and pace at which we are able to move functions to lower-cost locations, joint ventures and outsourcing providers may also be affected by political, regulatory and client acceptance issues, including with respect to data use, storage and security.  Such relocation or outsourcing of functions also entails costs, such as technology, real estate and restructuring expenses, that may offset or exceed the expected financial benefits of the relocation or outsourcing.  In addition, the financial benefits of lower-cost locations and of outsourcings may diminish over time or could be offset in the event that the U.S. or other jurisdictions impose tax and other measures which seek to discourage the use of lower cost jurisdictions. Our businesses may be negatively affected by adverse publicity or other reputational harm. Our relationship with many of our clients is predicated on our reputation as a fiduciary and a service provider that adheres to the highest standards of ethics, service quality and regulatory compliance.  Adverse publicity, regulatory actions or fines, litigation, operational failures or the failure to meet client expectations or fiduciary or other obligations could materially and adversely affect our reputation, our ability to attract and retain clients or key employees or our sources of funding for the same or other businesses.  For example, over the past several years we have experienced adverse publicity with respect to our indirect foreign exchange trading, and this adverse publicity has contributed to a shift of client volume to other foreign exchange execution methods.  Similarly, governmental actions and reputational issues in our transition management business in the U.K. have adversely affected our revenue from that business and, with the related deferred prosecution agreement with the DOJ entered into in early 2017 and SEC settlement, these effects have the potential to continue.  The client invoicing matter we announced in December 2015 has the potential to result in similar effects. For additional information about the settlement, see the risk factor ""Our businesses may be adversely affected by government enforcement and litigation"". Preserving and enhancing our reputation also depends on maintaining systems, procedures and controls that address known risks and regulatory requirements, as well as our ability to timely identify, understand and mitigate additional risks that arise due to changes in our businesses and the marketplaces in which we operate, the regulatory environment and client expectations. Our controls and procedures may fail or be circumvented, our risk management policies and procedures may be inadequate, and operational risk could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations. We may fail to identify and manage risks related to a variety of aspects of our business, including, but not limited to, operational risk, interest-rate risk, foreign exchange risk, trading risk, fiduciary risk, legal and compliance risk, liquidity risk and credit risk.  We have adopted various controls, procedures, policies and systems to monitor and manage risk.  While we currently believe that our risk management process is effective, we cannot provide assurance that those controls, procedures, policies and systems will always be adequate to identify and manage the internal and external, including service provider, risks in our various businesses.  The risk of individuals, either employees or contractors, engaging in conduct harmful or misleading to clients or us, such as consciously circumventing established control mechanisms to exceed trading or investment management limitations, committing fraud or improperly selling products or services to clients, is particularly challenging to manage through a control framework.  The financial and reputational impact of control or conduct failures can be significant.  Persistent or repeated issues with respect to controls or individual conduct may raise concerns among regulators regarding our culture, governance and control environment.  While we seek to contractually limit our financial exposure to operational risk, the degree of protection that we are able to achieve varies, and our potential exposure may be greater than the revenue we anticipate that we will earn from State Street Corporation | 36 Table of Contents servicing our clients. In addition, our businesses and the markets in which we operate are continuously evolving.  We may fail to identify or fully understand the implications of changes in our businesses or the financial markets and fail to adequately or timely enhance our risk framework to address those changes.  If our risk framework is ineffective, either because it fails to keep pace with changes in the financial markets, regulatory or industry requirements, our businesses, our counterparties, clients or service providers or for other reasons, we could incur losses, suffer reputational damage or find ourselves out of compliance with applicable regulatory or contractual mandates or expectations. Operational risk is inherent in all of our business activities.  As a leading provider of services to institutional investors, we provide a broad array of services, including research, investment management, trading services and investment servicing that expose us to operational risk. In addition, these services generate a broad array of complex and specialized servicing, confidentiality and fiduciary requirements, many of which involve the opportunity for human, systems or process errors.  We face the risk that the control policies, procedures and systems we have established to comply with our operational requirements will fail, will be inadequate or will become outdated.  We also face the potential for loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, employee supervision or monitoring mechanisms, service-provider processes or other systems or controls, which could materially affect our future consolidated results of operations.  Given the volume and magnitude of transactions we process on a daily basis, operational losses represent a potentially significant financial risk for our business.  Operational errors that result in us remitting funds to a failing or bankrupt entity may be irreversible, and may subject us to losses. We may also be subject to disruptions from external events that are wholly or partially beyond our control, which could cause delays or disruptions to operational functions, including information processing and financial market settlement functions.  In addition, our clients, vendors and counterparties could suffer from such events.  Should these events affect us, or the clients, vendors or counterparties with which we conduct business, our consolidated results of operations could be negatively affected.  When we record balance sheet accruals for probable and estimable loss contingencies related to operational losses, we may be unable to accurately estimate our potential exposure, and any accruals we establish to cover operational losses may not be sufficient to cover our actual financial exposure, which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations. The quantitative models we use to manage our business may contain errors that result in inadequate risk assessments, inaccurate valuations or poor business decisions, and lapses in disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial reporting could occur, any of which could result in material harm. We use quantitative models to help manage many different aspects of our businesses.  As an input to our overall assessment of capital adequacy, we use models to measure the amount of credit risk, market risk, operational risk, interest-rate risk and liquidity risk we face.  During the preparation of our consolidated financial statements, we sometimes use models to measure the value of asset and liability positions for which reliable market prices are not available.  We also use models to support many different types of business decisions including trading activities, hedging, asset-and-liability management and whether to change business strategy.  Weaknesses in the underlying model, inadequate model assumptions, normal model limitations, inappropriate model use, weaknesses in model implementation or poor data quality, could result in unanticipated and adverse consequences, including material loss and material non-compliance with regulatory requirements or expectations.  Because of our widespread usage of models, potential weaknesses in our model risk management practices pose an ongoing risk to us. We also may fail to accurately quantify the magnitude of the risks we face.  Our measurement methodologies rely on many assumptions and historical analyses and correlations.  These assumptions may be incorrect, and the historical correlations on which we rely may not continue to be relevant.  Consequently, the measurements that we make for regulatory purposes may not adequately capture or express the true risk profiles of our businesses.  Moreover, as businesses and markets evolve, our measurements may not accurately reflect this evolution. While our risk measures may indicate sufficient capitalization, they may underestimate the level of capital necessary to conduct our businesses. Additionally, our disclosure controls and procedures may not be effective in every circumstance, and, similarly, it is possible we may identify a material weakness or significant deficiency in internal control over financial reporting.  Any such lapses or deficiencies may materially and adversely affect our business and consolidated results of operations or consolidated financial condition, restrict our ability to access the capital markets, require us to expend significant resources to correct the lapses or deficiencies, expose us to regulatory or legal proceedings, subject us to fines, penalties or judgments or harm our reputation. State Street Corporation | 37 Table of Contents We may incur losses arising from our investments in sponsored investment funds, which could be material to our consolidated results of operations in the periods incurred. In the normal course of business, we manage various types of sponsored investment funds through SSGA.  The services we provide to these sponsored investment funds generate management fee revenue, as well as servicing fees from our other businesses.  From time to time, we may invest in the funds, which we refer to as seed capital, in order for the funds to establish a performance history for newly launched strategies.  These funds may meet the definition of variable interest entities, as defined by U.S. GAAP, and if we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary of these funds, we may be required to consolidate these funds in our consolidated financial statements under U.S. GAAP.  The funds follow specialized investment company accounting rules which prescribe fair value for the underlying investment securities held by the funds. In the aggregate, we expect any financial losses that we realize over time from these seed investments to be limited to the actual amount invested in the consolidated fund.  However, in the event of a fund wind-down, gross gains and losses of the fund may be recognized for financial accounting purposes in different periods during the time the fund is consolidated but not wholly owned.  Although we expect the actual economic loss to be limited to the amount invested, our losses in any period for financial accounting purposes could exceed the value of our economic interests in the fund and could exceed the value of our initial seed capital investment. In instances where we are not deemed to be the primary beneficiary of the sponsored investment fund, we do not include the funds in our consolidated financial statements.  Our risk of loss associated with investment in these unconsolidated funds primarily represents our seed capital investment, which could become realized as a result of poor investment performance.  However, the amount of loss we may recognize during any period would be limited to the carrying amount of our investment. Our reputation and business prospects may be damaged if our clients incur substantial losses in investment pools in which we act as agent or are restricted in redeeming their interests in these investment pools. We manage assets on behalf of clients in several forms, including in collective investment pools, money market funds, securities finance collateral pools, cash collateral and other cash products and short-term investment funds.  Our management of collective investment pools on behalf of clients exposes us to reputational risk and operational losses.  If our clients incur substantial investment losses in these pools, receive redemptions as in-kind distributions rather than in cash, or experience significant under-performance relative to the market or our competitors' products, our reputation could be significantly harmed, which harm could significantly and adversely affect the prospects of our associated business units.  Because we often implement investment and operational decisions and actions over multiple investment pools to achieve scale, we face the risk that losses, even small losses, may have a significant effect in the aggregate. Within our Investment Management business, we manage investment pools, such as mutual funds and collective investment funds that generally offer our clients the ability to withdraw their investments on short notice, generally daily or monthly.  This feature requires that we manage those pools in a manner that takes into account both maximizing the long-term return on the investment pool and retaining sufficient liquidity to meet reasonably anticipated liquidity requirements of our clients.  The importance of maintaining liquidity varies by product type, but it is a particularly important feature in money market funds and other products designed to maintain a constant net asset value of $1.00.  In the past, we have imposed restrictions on cash redemptions from the agency lending collateral pools, as the per-unit market value of those funds' assets had declined below the constant $1.00 the funds employ to effect purchase and redemption transactions.  Both the decline of the funds' net asset value below $1.00 and the imposition of restrictions on redemptions had a significant client, reputational and regulatory impact on us, and the recurrence of such or similar circumstances in the future could adversely impact our consolidated results of operations and financial condition.  We have also in the past continued to process purchase and redemption of units of investment products designed to maintain a constant net asset value at $1.00 although the fair market value of the fund's assets were less than $1.00.  If in the future  we were to continue to process purchases and redemptions from such products at $1.00 when the fair market value of our collateral pools' assets is less than $1.00, we could be exposed to significant liability. If higher than normal demands for liquidity from our clients were to occur, managing the liquidity requirements of our collective investment pools could become more difficult.  If such liquidity problems were to recur, our relationships with our clients may be adversely affected, and, we could, in certain circumstances, be required to consolidate the investment pools into our consolidated statement of condition; levels of redemption activity could increase; and our consolidated results of operations and business prospects could be adversely affected.  In State Street Corporation | 38 Table of Contents addition, if a money market fund that we manage were to have unexpected liquidity demands from investors in the fund that exceeded available liquidity, the fund could be required to sell assets to meet those redemption requirements, and selling the assets held by the fund at a reasonable price, if at all, may then be difficult. Because of the size of the investment pools that we manage, we may not have the financial ability or regulatory authority to support the liquidity or other demands of our clients. Any decision by us to provide financial support to an investment pool to support our reputation in circumstances where we are not statutorily or contractually obligated to do so could result in the recognition of significant losses, could adversely affect the regulatory view of our capital levels or plans and could, in some cases, require us to consolidate the investment pools into our consolidated statement of condition.  Any failure of the pools to meet redemption requests, or under- performance of our pools relative to similar products offered by our competitors, could harm our business and our reputation. Development of new products and services may impose additional costs on us and may expose us to increased operational and model risk. Our financial performance depends, in part, on our ability to develop and market new and innovative services and to adopt or develop new technologies that differentiate our products or provide cost efficiencies, while avoiding increased related expenses.  This dependency is exacerbated in the current ""FinTech"" environment, where financial institutions are investing significantly in evaluating new technologies, such as ""Blockchain,"" and developing potentially industry-changing new products, services and industry standards.  The introduction of new products and services can entail significant time and resources, including regulatory approvals.  Substantial risks and uncertainties are associated with the introduction of new products and services, including technical, control and model validation requirements, which may need to be developed and implemented, rapid technological change in the industry, our ability to access technical and other information from our clients, the significant and ongoing investments required to bring new products and services to market in a timely manner at competitive prices and the preparation of marketing, sales and other materials that fully and accurately describe the product or service and its underlying risks and are compliant with applicable regulations.  Our failure to manage these risks and uncertainties also exposes us to enhanced risk of operational lapses which may result in the recognition of financial statement liabilities. Regulatory and internal control requirements, capital requirements, competitive alternatives, vendor relationships and shifting market preferences may also determine if such initiatives can be brought to market in a manner that is timely and attractive to our clients.  Failure to successfully manage these risks in the development and implementation of new products or services could have a material adverse effect on our business and reputation, as well as on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition. We depend on information technology, and any failures of or damage to, attack on or unauthorized access to our information technology systems or facilities, or those of third parties with which we do business, including as a result of cyber-attacks, could result in significant limits on our ability to conduct our operations and activities, costs and reputational damage. Our businesses depend on information technology infrastructure, both internal and external, to, among other things, record and process a large volume of increasingly complex transactions and other data, in many currencies, on a daily basis, across numerous and diverse markets and jurisdictions.  In recent years, several financial services firms have suffered successful cyber-attacks launched both domestically and from abroad, resulting in the disruption of services to clients, loss or misappropriation of sensitive or private data and reputational harm.  We also have been subjected to cyber-attack, and although we have not to our knowledge suffered a material breach or suspension of our systems, it is possible that we could suffer such a breach or suspension in the future.  Cyber-threats are sophisticated and continually evolving. We may not implement effective systems and other measures to effectively prevent or mitigate the full diversity of cyber-threats or improve and adapt such systems and measures as such threats evolve and advance. Our computer, communications, data processing, networks, backup, business continuity or other operating, information or technology systems and facilities, including those that we outsource to other providers, may fail to operate properly or become disabled, overloaded or damaged as a result of a number of factors, including events that are wholly or partially beyond our control, which could adversely affect our ability to process transactions, provide services or maintain systems availability, maintain compliance and internal controls or otherwise appropriately conduct our business activities.  For example, there could be sudden increases in transaction or data volumes, electrical or telecommunications outages, natural disasters, cyber-attacks or employee or contractor error or malfeasance. The third parties with which we do business, which facilitate our business activities or with whom we otherwise engage or interact, including financial State Street Corporation | 39 Table of Contents intermediaries and technology infrastructure and service providers, are also susceptible to the foregoing risks (including regarding the third parties with which they are similarly interconnected or on which they otherwise rely), and our or their business operations and activities may therefore be adversely affected, perhaps materially, by failures, terminations, errors or malfeasance by, or attacks or constraints on, one or more financial, technology, infrastructure or government institutions or intermediaries with whom we or they are interconnected or conduct business. In particular, we, like other financial services firms, will continue to face increasing cyber threats, including computer viruses, malicious code, distributed denial of service attacks, phishing attacks, ransomware, information security breaches or employee or contractor error or malfeasance that could result in the unauthorized release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, loss or destruction of our, our clients' or other parties' confidential, personal, proprietary or other information or otherwise disrupt, compromise or damage our or our clients' or other parties' business assets, operations and activities.  Our status as a global systemically important financial institution likely increases the risk that we are targeted by such cyber- security threats.  In addition, some of our service offerings, such as data warehousing, may also increase the risk we are, and the consequences of being, so-targeted.  We therefore could experience significant related costs and exposures, including lost or constrained ability to provide our services or maintain systems availability to clients, regulatory inquiries, enforcements, actions and fines, litigation, damage to our reputation or property and enhanced competition. Due to our dependence on technology and the important role it plays in our business operations, we must persist in improving and updating our information technology infrastructure (1) as some of our systems are approaching the end of their useful life, are redundant or do not share data without reconciliation; and (2) in order to be more efficient, enhance resiliency, meet client expectations and support opportunities of growth. Updating these systems often involves implementation, integration and security risks, including risks that we may not adequately anticipate the market or technological trends or client needs or experience unexpected challenges that could cause financial, reputational and operational harm.  However, failing to properly respond to and invest in changes and advancements in technology can limit our ability to attract and retain clients, prevent us from offering similar products and services as those offered by our competitors and inhibit our ability to meet regulatory requirements. Any theft, loss or other misappropriation or inadvertent disclosure of, or inappropriate access to, the confidential information we possess could have an adverse impact on our business and could subject us to regulatory actions, litigation and other adverse effects. Our businesses and relationships with clients are dependent on our ability to maintain the confidentiality of our and our clients' trade secrets and confidential information (including client transactional data and personal data about our employees, our clients and our clients' clients).  Unauthorized access, or failure of our controls with respect to granting access to our systems, may occur, potentially resulting in theft, loss, or other misappropriation of such information.  Any theft, loss, other misappropriation or inadvertent disclosure of confidential information could have a material adverse impact on our competitive position, our relationships with our clients and our reputation and could subject us to regulatory inquiries, enforcement and fines, civil litigation and possible financial liability or costs. We may not be able to protect our intellectual property, and we are subject to claims of third- party intellectual property rights. Our potential inability to protect our intellectual property and proprietary technology effectively may allow competitors to duplicate our technology and products and may adversely affect our ability to compete with them.  To the extent that we do not protect our intellectual property effectively through patents, maintaining trade secrets or other means, other parties, including former employees, with knowledge of our intellectual property may leave and seek to exploit our intellectual property for their own or others' advantage.  In addition, we may infringe on claims of third-party patents, and we may face intellectual property challenges from other parties, including clients or service providers with whom we may engage in the development or implementation of other products, services or solutions.  The risk of such infringement is enhanced in the current competitive ""Fintech"" environment, particularly with respect to our development of new products and services containing significant technology elements and dependencies, any of which could become the subject of an infringement claim.  We may not be successful in defending against any such challenges or in obtaining licenses to avoid or resolve any intellectual property disputes.  Third-party intellectual rights, valid or not, may also impede our deployment of the full scope of our products and service capabilities in all jurisdictions in which we operate or market our products and services. State Street Corporation | 40 Table of Contents Acquisitions, strategic alliances, joint ventures and divestitures pose risks for our business. As part of our business strategy, we acquire complementary businesses and technologies, enter into strategic alliances and joint ventures and divest portions of our business.  We undertake transactions of varying sizes to, among other reasons, expand our geographic footprint, access new clients, technologies or services, develop closer or more collaborative relationships with our business partners, bolster existing servicing capabilities, efficiently deploy capital or leverage cost savings or other business or financial opportunities.  We may not achieve the expected benefits of these transactions, which could result in increased costs, lowered revenues, ineffective deployment of capital, regulatory concerns, exit costs or diminished competitive position or reputation. Transactions of this nature also involve a number of risks and financial, accounting, tax, regulatory, strategic, managerial, operational, cultural and employment challenges, which could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations and financial condition.  For example, the businesses that we acquire or our strategic alliances or joint ventures may under-perform relative to the price paid or the resources committed by us; we may not achieve anticipated revenue growth or cost savings; or we may otherwise be adversely affected by acquisition-related charges.  The intellectual property of an acquired business may be an important component of the value that we agree to pay for such a business.  However, such acquisitions are subject to the risks that the acquired business may not own the intellectual property that we believe we are acquiring, that the intellectual property is dependent on licenses from third parties, that the acquired business infringes on the intellectual property rights of others, that the technology does not have the acceptance in the marketplace that we anticipated or that the technology requires significant investment to remain competitive.  Further, past acquisitions have resulted in the recognition of goodwill and other significant intangible assets in our consolidated statement of condition.  For example, we recorded goodwill and intangible assets of $453 million associated with our acquisition of GE Asset Management in 2016.  These assets are not eligible for inclusion in regulatory capital under applicable requirements.  In addition, we may be required to record impairment in our consolidated statement of income in future periods if we determine that the value of these assets has declined. Through our acquisitions or joint ventures, we may also assume unknown or undisclosed business, operational, tax, regulatory and other liabilities, fail to properly assess known contingent liabilities or assume businesses with internal control deficiencies. While in most of our transactions we seek to mitigate these risks through, among other things, due diligence and indemnification provisions, these or other risk-mitigating provisions we put in place may not be sufficient to address these liabilities and contingencies.  Other major financial services firms have recently paid significant penalties to resolve government investigations into matters conducted in significant part by acquired entities. Various regulatory approvals or consents, formal or informal, are generally required prior to closing of these transactions, which may include approvals or non-objections from the Federal Reserve and other domestic and non-U.S. regulatory authorities.  These regulatory authorities may impose conditions on the completion of the acquisition or require changes to its terms that materially affect the terms of the transaction or our ability to capture some of the opportunities presented by the transaction, or may not approve the transaction.  Any such conditions, or any associated regulatory delays, could limit the benefits of the transaction.  Acquisitions or joint ventures we announce may not be completed if we do not receive the required regulatory approvals, if regulatory approvals are significantly delayed or if other closing conditions are not satisfied. The integration of our acquisitions results in risks to our business and other uncertainties. The integration of acquisitions presents risks that differ from the risks associated with our ongoing operations.  Integration activities are complicated and time consuming and can involve significant unforeseen costs.  We may not be able to effectively assimilate services, technologies, key personnel or businesses of acquired companies into our business or service offerings as anticipated, alliances may not be successful, and we may not achieve related revenue growth or cost savings. We also face the risk of being unable to retain, or cross-sell our products or services to, the clients of acquired companies or joint ventures and the risk of being unable to cross-sell acquired products or services to our existing clients.  Acquisitions of investment servicing businesses entail information technology systems conversions, which involve operational risks.  Acquisitions of technology firms can involve extensive information technology integration, with associated risk of defects and product enhancement and development activities, the costs of which can be difficult to estimate.  Clients of businesses that we have acquired may be dissatisfied with the acquisition and choose to limit or terminate their relationship with us, a risk which increases where those clients are competitors.  The loss of some of these clients or a significant reduction in the revenues generated from them, for competitive or other reasons, could adversely affect the benefits that we expect to achieve from these acquisitions or cause impairment to goodwill and other intangibles. State Street Corporation | 41 Table of Contents With any acquisition, the integration of the operations and resources of the businesses could result in the loss of key employees, the disruption of our and the acquired company's ongoing businesses or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures or policies that could adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with clients or employees, maintain regulatory compliance or to achieve the anticipated benefits of the acquisition. Integration efforts may also divert management attention and resources. Competition for our employees is intense, and we may not be able to attract and retain the highly skilled people we need to support our business. Our success depends, in large part, on our ability to attract and retain key people. Competition for the best people in most activities in which we engage can be intense, and we may not be able to hire people or retain them, particularly in light of challenges associated with evolving compensation restrictions applicable, or which may become applicable, to banks and some asset managers and that potentially are not applicable to other financial services firms in all jurisdictions or to technology firms, generally.  The unexpected loss of services of key personnel in business units, control functions, information technology, operations or other areas could have a material adverse impact on our business because of their skills, their knowledge of our markets, operations and clients, their years of industry experience and, in some cases, the difficulty of promptly finding qualified replacement personnel.  Similarly, the loss of key employees, either individually or as a group, could adversely affect our clients' perception of our ability to continue to manage certain types of investment management mandates to provide other services to them or to maintain a culture of innovation and proficiency. We are subject to intense competition in all aspects of our business, which could negatively affect our ability to maintain or increase our profitability. The markets in which we operate across all facets of our business are both highly competitive and global.  These markets are changing as a result of new and evolving laws and regulations applicable to financial services institutions.  Regulatory-driven market changes cannot always be anticipated, and may adversely affect the demand for, and profitability of, the products and services that we offer.  In addition, new market entrants and competitors may address changes in the markets more rapidly than we do, or may provide clients with a more attractive offering of products and services, adversely affecting our business.  Our efforts to develop and market new products, particularly in the ""Fintech"" sector, may position us in new markets with pre-existing competitors with strong market position.  We have also experienced, and anticipate that we will continue to experience, significant pricing pressure in many of our core businesses, particularly our custodial and investment management services.  This pricing pressure has and may continue to impact our revenue growth and operational margins and may limit the positive impact of new client demand and growth in AUCA. Many of our businesses compete with other domestic and international banks and financial services companies, such as custody banks, investment advisors, broker/dealers, outsourcing companies and data processing companies.  Further consolidation within the financial services industry could also pose challenges to us in the markets we serve, including potentially increased downward pricing pressure across our businesses. Some of our competitors, including our competitors in core services, have substantially greater capital resources than we do or are not subject to as stringent capital or other regulatory requirements as are we.  In some of our businesses, we are service providers to significant competitors. These competitors are in some instances significant clients, and the retention of these clients involves additional risks, such as the avoidance of actual or perceived conflicts of interest and the maintenance of high levels of service quality and intra-company confidentiality.  The ability of a competitor to offer comparable or improved products or services at a lower price would likely negatively affect our ability to maintain or increase our profitability.  Many of our core services are subject to contracts that have relatively short terms or may be terminated by our client after a short notice period.  In addition, pricing pressures as a result of the activities of competitors, client pricing reviews, and rebids, as well as the introduction of new products, may result in a reduction in the prices we can charge for our products and services. Long-term contracts expose us to pricing and performance risk. We enter into long-term contracts to provide middle office or investment manager and alternative investment manager operations outsourcing services to clients, including services related but not limited to certain trading activities, cash reporting, settlement and reconciliation activities, collateral management and information technology development.  We also may enter into longer-term arrangements with respect to custody, fund administration and depository services.  These arrangements generally set forth our fee schedule for the term of the contract and, absent a change in service requirements, do not permit us to re-price the contract for changes in our costs or for market pricing.  The long-term contracts for these relationships require, in some cases, considerable up-front investment by us, including technology and State Street Corporation | 42 Table of Contents conversion costs, and carry the risk that pricing for the products and services we provide might not prove adequate to generate expected operating margins over the term of the contracts. The profitability of these contracts is largely a function of our ability to accurately calculate pricing for our services, efficiently assume our contractual responsibilities in a timely manner, control our costs and maintain the relationship with the client for an adequate period of time to recover our up-front investment.  Our estimate of the profitability of these arrangements can be adversely affected by declines in the assets under the clients' management, whether due to general declines in the securities markets or client-specific issues.  In addition, the profitability of these arrangements may be based on our ability to cross-sell additional services to these clients, and we may be unable to do so. Performance risk exists in each contract, given our dependence on successful conversion and implementation onto our own operating platforms of the service activities provided.  Our failure to meet specified service levels or implementation timelines may also adversely affect our revenue from such arrangements, or permit early termination of the contracts by the client.  If the demand for these types of services were to decline, we could see our revenue decline. Changes in accounting standards may adversely affect our consolidated financial statements. New accounting standards, or changes to existing accounting standards, resulting both from initiatives of the FASB as well as changes in the interpretation of existing accounting standards, by the FASB or the SEC or otherwise reflected in U.S. GAAP, potentially could affect our consolidated results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.  These changes can materially affect how we record and report our consolidated results of operations, cash flows, financial condition and other financial information.  In some cases, we could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively, resulting in the revised treatment of certain transactions or activities, and, in some cases, the revision of our consolidated financial statements for prior periods.  For additional information regarding change in accounting standards, refer to the ""Recent Accounting Developments"" section of Note 1 included under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Form 10-K. Changes in tax laws, rules or regulations, challenges to our tax positions with respect to historical transactions, and changes in the composition of our pre-tax earnings may increase our effective tax rate and thus adversely affect our consolidated financial statements. Our businesses can be directly or indirectly affected by new tax legislation, the expiration of existing tax laws or the interpretation of existing tax laws worldwide. On December 22, 2017, the United States enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (H.R. 1), effective January 2018.  This decreased the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, repealed the alternative minimum tax and replaced the existing worldwide tax system with a modified territorial system.  The modified territorial system eliminates income tax on foreign dividends and introduces new provisions that generate incremental tax on foreign earnings, base erosion payments and limit the benefit of foreign tax credits.  There is uncertainty around the application of these provisions, generally and as to their applicability to our business, and guidance from the Internal Revenue Service has been limited to date.  Although we have not yet fully determined the impact of these provisions, it is possible these new provisions could diminish the benefit of the lower U.S. corporate income tax rate. U.S. state governments, including Massachusetts, and jurisdictions around the world continue to review proposals to amend tax laws, rules and regulations applicable to our businesses that could have a negative impact on our capital or after-tax earnings. In the normal course of our business, we are subject to review by U.S. and non-U.S. tax authorities.  A review by any such authority could result in an increase in our recorded tax liability.  In addition to the aforementioned risks, our effective tax rate is dependent on the nature and geographic composition of our pre-tax earnings and could be negatively affected by changes in these factors. We may incur losses as a result of unforeseen events, including terrorist attacks, natural disasters, the emergence of a pandemic or acts of embezzlement. Acts of terrorism, natural disasters or the emergence of a pandemic could significantly affect our business.  We have instituted disaster recovery and continuity plans to address risks from terrorism, natural disasters and pandemic; however, anticipating or addressing all potential contingencies is not possible for events of this nature.  Acts of terrorism, either targeted or broad in scope, or natural disasters could damage our physical facilities, harm our employees and disrupt our operations.  A pandemic, or concern about a possible pandemic, could lead to operational difficulties and impair our ability to manage our business.  Acts of terrorism, natural disasters and pandemics could also negatively affect our clients, counterparties and service providers, as well as result in disruptions in general economic activity and the financial markets. State Street Corporation | 43 Table of Contents","ITEM 7.   MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS GENERAL As of December 31, 2017, we had consolidated total assets of $238.43 billion, consolidated total deposits of $184.90 billion, consolidated total shareholders' equity of $22.32 billion and 36,643 employees.  We operate in more than 100 geographic markets worldwide, including in the U.S., Canada, Europe, the Middle East and Asia. Our operations are organized into two lines of business, Investment Servicing and Investment Management, which are defined based on products and services provided. Investment Servicing provides services for institutional clients, including mutual funds, collective investment funds and other investment pools, corporate and public retirement plans, insurance companies, investment managers, foundations and endowments worldwide.  Products include custody; product and participant level accounting; daily pricing and administration; master trust and master custody; depotbank services (a fund oversight role created by regulation); record-keeping; cash management; foreign exchange, brokerage and other trading services; securities finance; our enhanced custody product, which integrates principal securities lending and custody; deposit and short-term investment facilities; loans and lease financing; investment manager and alternative investment manager operations outsourcing; performance, risk and compliance analytics; and financial data management to support institutional investors. Investment Management, through SSGA, provides a broad array of investment management, investment research and investment advisory services to corporations, public funds and other sophisticated investors.  SSGA offers passive and active asset management strategies across equity, fixed-income, alternative, multi-asset solutions (including OCIO) and cash asset classes.  Products are distributed directly and through intermediaries using a variety of investment vehicles, including ETFs, such as the SPDR® ETF brand. For financial and other information about our lines of business, refer to ""Line of Business Information"" in this Management's Discussion and Analysis and Note 24 to the consolidated financial statements included under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Form 10-K. This Management's Discussion and Analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements included under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Form 10-K.  Certain previously reported amounts presented in this Form 10-K have been reclassified to conform to current-period presentation. We prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP.  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions in its application of certain accounting policies that materially affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, equity, revenue and expenses. The significant accounting policies that require us to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that are difficult, subjective or complex about matters that are uncertain and may change in subsequent periods include:  accounting for fair value measurements;  other-than-temporary impairment of investment securities;  impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets; and  contingencies. These significant accounting policies require the most subjective or complex judgments, and underlying estimates and assumptions could be subject to revision as new information becomes available.  Additional information about these significant accounting policies is included under ""Significant Accounting Estimates"" in this Management's Discussion and Analysis. Certain financial information provided in this Form 10-K, including in this Management's Discussion and Analysis, is prepared on both a U.S. GAAP, or reported basis, and a non-GAAP basis, including certain non-GAAP measures used in the calculation of identified regulatory ratios.  We measure and compare certain financial information on a non-GAAP basis, including information (such as capital ratios calculated under regulatory standards scheduled to be effective in the future) that management uses in evaluating our business and activities. Non-GAAP financial information should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for or superior to, financial information prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP.  Any non-GAAP financial information presented in this Form 10-K, including this Management's Discussion and Analysis, is reconciled to its most directly comparable currently applicable regulatory ratio or U.S. GAAP-basis measure. We further believe that our presentation of fully taxable-equivalent NII, a non-GAAP measure, which reports non-taxable revenue, such as interest income State Street Corporation | 53 associated with tax-exempt investment securities, on a fully taxable-equivalent basis, facilitates an investor's understanding and analysis of our underlying financial performance and trends. This Management's Discussion and Analysis contains statements that are considered ""forward-looking statements"" within the meaning of U.S. securities laws.  Forward-looking statements include statements about our goals and expectations regarding our business, financial and capital condition, results of operations, strategies, financial portfolio performance, dividend and stock purchase programs, expected outcomes of legal proceedings, market growth, acquisitions, joint ventures and divestitures and new technologies, services and opportunities, as well as industry, regulatory, economic and market trends, initiatives and developments, the business environment and other matters that do not relate strictly to historical facts. These forward-looking statements involve certain risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially.  We undertake no obligation to revise the forward-looking statements contained in this Management's Discussion and Analysis to reflect events after the time we file this Form 10-K with the SEC.  Additional information about forward-looking statements and related risks and uncertainties is provided in ""Risk Factors"" under Item 1A of this Form 10-K. We provide additional disclosures required by applicable bank regulatory standards, including supplemental qualitative and quantitative information with respect to regulatory capital (including market risk associated with our trading activities) and the liquidity coverage ratio, summary results of semi-annual State Street-run stress tests which we conduct under the Dodd-Frank Act, and resolution plan disclosures required under the Dodd-Frank Act.  These additional disclosures are accessible on the ""Investor Relations"" section of our corporate website at www.statestreet.com. We have included our website address in this report as an inactive textual reference only.  Information on our website is not incorporated by reference into this Form 10-K. We use acronyms and other defined terms for certain business terms and abbreviations, as defined on the acronyms list and glossary included under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Form 10-K.

The following ""Financial Results and Highlights"" section provides information related to significant events, as well as highlights of our consolidated financial results for the year ended December 31, 2017 presented in Table 1: Overview of Financial Results.  More detailed information about our consolidated financial results, including comparisons of our financial results for the year ended December 31, 2017 to those for the year ended December 31, 2016, is provided under ""Consolidated Results of Operations,"" ""Line of Business Information"" and ""Capital"" which follows these sections, as well as in our consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K.  In this Management's Discussion and Analysis, where we describe the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates, those effects are determined by applying applicable weighted average foreign exchange rates from the relevant 2016 period to the relevant 2017 period results. State Street Corporation | 54 Table of Contents MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Financial Results and Highlights  EPS of $5.24 in 2017 increased 5% compared to $4.97 in 2016. <U+25E6> Both 2017 and 2016 include the impact of notable items.  The 2017 results include a one-time estimated net impact of $270 million associated with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA).  This impact consisted of a one-time estimated tax expense of approximately $250 million and a one-time reduction of approximately $20 million in revenue. <U+25AA> Actual effects of the TCJA may differ from these estimates, among other things, due to additional tax and regulatory guidance and changes in our assumptions and interpretations. <U+25E6> The 2016 results include an acceleration of compensation expense of $249 million ($161 million after-tax) and tax benefits of $211 million resulting from a reduction in accrued tax expense attributable to retained foreign earnings and tax benefits from capital actions involving our overseas affiliates.  2017 ROE of 10.6% increased from 10.5% in 2016.  Pre-tax margin of 26.0% in 2017 increased from 20.8% in 2016. Revenue  Total revenue and fee revenue increased 9% and 10%, respectively, in 2017 compared to 2016, primarily driven by strength in servicing fees, management fees, processing and other fees, and the impact of the weaker U.S. dollar, partially offset by lower trading services revenue.  Servicing fee revenue increased 6% in 2017 compared to 2016, primarily due to market appreciation and net new business, partially offset by continued hedge fund outflows and the impact of the businesses we exited in 2017.  Management fee revenue increased 25% in 2017 compared to 2016, primarily due to the GEAM business acquired in 2016, continued strength in global equity markets, and ETF flows.  NII increased 11% in 2017 compared to 2016, driven by higher market interest rates in the U.S. and loan portfolio growth, partially offset by a smaller balance sheet. Expenses  Total expenses increased 2% in 2017 compared to 2016, primarily due to higher restructuring charges, information systems and communications costs, and compensation and employee benefit costs, partially offset by approximately $150 million of Beacon savings.  Total Beacon program-to-date savings were approximately $325 million through December 31, 2017.  In 2017, we recorded restructuring charges of $245 million related to Beacon.  We expect Beacon target savings of $550 million to be realized by mid-2019, 18 months ahead of schedule. AUCA/AUM  AUCA increased 15% in 2017 compared to 2016, primarily due to strength in equity markets, flows, and new business.  In 2017, we secured new asset servicing mandates of approximately $445 billion.  Our AUCA pipeline of asset servicing mandates remaining to be installed in future periods totaled approximately $350 billion as of December 31, 2017.  AUM increased 13% in 2017 compared to 2016, primarily driven by strength in equity markets, weaker U.S. dollar, and positive ETF flows. Capital  We declared aggregate common stock dividends of $1.60 per share, totaling approximately $596 million in 2017, compared to $1.44 per share, totaling $559 million in 2016, representing an increase of approximately 11% on a per share basis.  In 2017, we acquired 16.8 million shares of common stock at an average per-share cost of $86.37 and an aggregate cost of approximately $1,450 million under common stock purchase programs approved by our Board.  CET1 capital ratio under the Basel III standardized approach increased to 11.9% as of December 31, 2017, compared to 11.6% as of December 31, 2016.  Tier 1 leverage ratio increased to 7.3% as of December 31, 2017, compared to 6.5% as of December 31, 2016.

Servicing and management fees collectively made up approximately 78% of total fee revenue in both 2017 and 2016 compared to approximately 76% in 2015.  The level of these fees is influenced by several factors, including the mix and volume of our AUCA and our AUM, the value and type of securities positions held (with respect to assets under custody), the volume of portfolio transactions, and the types of products and services used by our clients, and is generally affected by changes in worldwide equity and fixed-income security valuations and trends in market asset class preferences. Generally, servicing fees are affected by changes in daily average valuations of AUCA.  Additional factors, such as the relative mix of assets serviced, the level of transaction volumes, changes in service level, the nature of services provided, balance credits, client minimum balances, pricing concessions, the geographical location in which services are provided and other factors, may have a significant effect on our servicing fee revenue. Management fees generally are affected by changes in month-end valuations of AUM.  Management fees for certain components of managed assets, such as ETFs, are affected by daily average valuations of AUM.  Management fee revenue is more sensitive to market valuations than servicing fee revenue, as a higher proportion of the underlying services provided, and the associated management fees earned, are dependent on equity and fixed-income security valuations.  Additional factors, such as the relative mix of assets managed, may have a significant effect on our management fee revenue.  While certain management fees are directly determined by the values of AUM and the investment strategies employed, management fees may reflect other factors, including performance fee arrangements, as well as our relationship pricing for clients using multiple services. Asset-based management fees for actively managed products are generally charged at a higher percentage of AUM than for passive products.  Actively managed products may also include performance fee arrangements which are recorded when the fee is earned, based on predetermined benchmarks associated with the applicable fund's performance. In light of the above, we estimate, using relevant information as of December 31, 2017 and assuming that all other factors remain constant, that:  A 10% increase or decrease in worldwide equity valuations, on a weighted average basis, over the relevant periods for which our servicing and management fees are calculated, would result in a corresponding change in our total servicing and management fee revenues of approximately 3%; and  A 10% increase or decrease in worldwide fixed income markets, on a weighted average basis, over the relevant periods for which our servicing and management fees are calculated, would result in a corresponding change in our total servicing and management fee revenues of approximately 1%.

While the specific indices presented are indicative of general market trends, the asset types and classes relevant to individual client portfolios can and do differ, and the performance of associated relevant indices can therefore differ from the performance of the indices presented. Daily averages, month-end averages, and year- end indices demonstrate worldwide changes in equity and debt markets that affect our servicing and management fee revenue.

Net Interest Income See Table 2: Total Revenue, for the breakout of interest income and interest expense for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015.  NII was $2,304 million for 2017 compared to $2,084 million and $2,088 million for 2016 and 2015, respectively. NII is defined as interest income earned on interest-earning assets less interest expense incurred on interest-bearing liabilities.  Interest-earning assets, which principally consist of investment securities, interest-bearing deposits with banks, repurchase agreements, loans and leases and other liquid assets, are financed primarily by client deposits, short-term borrowings and long-term debt. NIM represents the relationship between annualized fully taxable-equivalent NII and average total interest-earning assets for the period.  It is calculated by dividing fully taxable-equivalent NII by average interest-earning assets.  Revenue that is exempt from income taxes, mainly that earned from certain investment securities (state and political subdivisions), is adjusted to a fully taxable-equivalent basis using the U.S. federal and state statutory income tax rates.

Excluding the impact of netting, the average interest rates would be approximately 0.79%, 0.43% and 0.19% for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. (2) Average rate includes the impact of FX swap expense of approximately $141 million, $27 million and $44 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  Average rates for total interest-bearing deposits excluding the impact of FX swap expense were 0.02%, 0.04% and 0.04% for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. See Table 5: Average Balances and Interest Rates - Fully Taxable-Equivalent Basis, for the breakout of NII on a fully taxable-equivalent basis for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015.  NII on a fully taxable-equivalent basis increased in 2017 compared to 2016, as benefits due to higher U.S. market interest rates, disciplined liability pricing and loan portfolio growth, partially offset by a smaller balance sheet.  Average balances in 2017 reflect management actions to reduce the usage of wholesale certificates of deposit (CDs) on our balance sheet.  Average interest-bearing and noninterest-bearing deposits were approximately $6.71 billion lower in 2017 compared to 2016, primarily due to a $9.64 billion reduction in wholesale CDs, partially offset by an increase in client deposits. We recorded aggregate discount accretion in interest income of approximately $19 million in 2017, respectively, related to the assets we consolidated onto our balance sheet in 2009 from our asset-backed commercial paper conduits.  Assuming that we hold the former conduit securities remaining in our investment portfolio until they mature or are sold, we expect to generate aggregate discount accretion in future periods of approximately $123 million over their remaining terms. The timing and ultimate recognition of any applicable discount accretion depends, in part, on factors that are outside of our control, including anticipated prepayment speeds and credit quality. The impact of these factors is uncertain and can be significantly influenced by general economic and financial market conditions.  The timing and recognition of any applicable discount accretion can also be influenced by or ongoing management of the risks and other characteristics associated with our investment securities portfolio, including sales of securities which would otherwise generate interest revenue through accretion. Changes in the components of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities are discussed in more detail below.  Additional information about the components of interest income and interest expense is provided in Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K. Average total interest-earning assets were $7.95 billion lower in 2017 compared to 2016, primarily driven by lower levels of wholesale CDs and State Street Corporation | 58 Table of Contents MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS corresponding reductions in interest-bearing deposits with banks and investment securities. Interest-bearing deposits with banks averaged $47.51 billion in 2017 compared to $53.09 billion in 2016.  These deposits primarily reflect our maintenance of cash balances at the Federal Reserve, the ECB and other non-U.S. central banks. Securities purchased under resale agreements averaged $2.13 billion in 2017 compared to $2.56 billion in 2016, which reflects the impact of balance sheet netting under enforceable netting agreements of approximately $31 billion and $30 billion for 2017 and 2016, respectively.  We maintain an agreement with a clearing organization that enables us to net all securities sold under repurchase agreements against those purchased under resale agreements with counterparties that are also members of the clearing organization. Investment securities averaged $95.78 billion in 2017 compared to $100.74 billion in 2016.  The decrease in average investment securities was driven by a reduction in U.S. Treasury securities and continued investment in loans and leases. Loans and leases averaged $21.92 billion in 2017 compared to $19.01 billion in 2016.  The increase in average loans and leases resulted from growth in loans to municipalities, hedge fund collateralized lending, mutual fund lending, and continued investment in senior secured loans.  Loans and leases also includes U.S. and non-U.S. overdrafts, which provide liquidity to clients in support of investment activities.  Average U.S. and non-U.S. overdrafts remained relatively stable in 2017 at $2.26 billion and $1.46 billion, respectively, from $2.28 billion and $1.36 billion in 2016. Average other interest-earning assets remained relatively stable with $22.88 billion in 2017 and $22.86 billion in 2016.  Our average other interest-earning assets, largely associated with our enhanced custody business, comprised approximately 12% of our average total assets in 2017 and 2016.  The enhanced custody business is our securities financing business where we act as principal with respect to our custody clients and generate securities finance revenue.  The NII earned on these transactions is generally lower than the interest earned on other alternative investments. Aggregate average U.S. and non-U.S. interest-bearing deposits decreased to $122.56 billion in 2017 from $125.66 billion in 2016.  The lower levels in 2017 compared to the prior year period were a result of higher U.S. and non-U.S. interest bearing client deposit levels during the year, offset by management actions to reduce wholesale CDs.  In 2017, a full year average of $3.62 billion of non-U.S. interest-bearing deposits was transferred to U.S. interest bearing deposits.  Future deposit levels will be influenced by the underlying asset servicing business, client deposit behavior, and market conditions, including the general levels of U.S. and non-U.S. interest rates. Average other short-term borrowings declined to $1.31 billion in 2017 from $1.67 billion in 2016, as bonds matured in the tax-exempt investment program. Average long-term debt was $11.60 billion in 2017, compared to $11.40 billion in 2016.  These amounts reflect issuances of senior debt, partially offset by maturities, during the respective periods. Average other interest-bearing liabilities were $4.61 billion in 2017 compared to $5.39 billion in 2016.  Other interest-bearing liabilities primarily reflect our level of cash collateral received from clients in connection with our enhanced custody business, which is presented on a net basis where we have enforceable netting agreements. Several factors could affect future levels of NII and NIM, including the volume and mix of client liabilities; actions of various central banks; changes in the level of U.S. and non-U.S. interest rates and the slope of various yield curves around the world; revised or proposed regulatory capital or liquidity standards, or interpretations of those standards; the amount of discount accretion generated by the former conduit securities that remain in our investment securities portfolio; the yields earned on securities purchased compared to the yields earned on securities sold or matured; changes in the type and amount of credit or other loans we extend; and changes in our enhanced custody business. Based on market conditions and other factors, including regulatory standards, we continue to reinvest the majority of the proceeds from pay-downs and maturities of investment securities in highly-rated securities, such as U.S. Treasury and agency securities, municipal securities, federal agency MBS and U.S. and non-U.S. mortgage- and ABS.  The pace at which we continue to reinvest and the types of investment securities purchased will depend on the impact of market conditions, the implementation of regulatory standards, including interpretation of those standards and other factors over time.  We expect these factors and the levels of global interest rates to influence what effect our reinvestment program will have on future levels of our NII and NIM. Provision for Loan Losses We recorded a provision for loan losses of $2 million in 2017 compared to $10 million in 2016 and $12 million in 2015.  The provisions in these periods were recorded in connection with our exposure to non-investment grade borrowers composed of senior secured loans, which we purchased in connection with our participation in loan syndications in the non- State Street Corporation | 59 Table of Contents MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS investment grade lending market.  Additional information about these senior secured loans is provided under ""Loans and Leases"" in ""Financial Condition"" in this Management's Discussion and Analysis and in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements included under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Form 10-K.

In December 2016, we recorded a pre-tax charge of $249 million ($161 million after tax) associated with an amendment of the terms of outstanding, previously issued, deferred cash-settled incentive compensation awards for certain employees to remove continued service requirements, thereby accelerating the future expense that would have been recognized over the remaining term of the awards had the continued service requirement not been removed. Compensation and employee benefits expenses increased 7% in 2016 compared to 2015.  The increase was primarily due to the aforementioned acceleration of compensation expenses and the impact of the GEAM business acquired in 2016. Headcount increased 8% in 2017 compared to 2016.  The growth in headcount was primarily within low cost locations.  These increases were driven by strategic initiatives and new business, including the impact of large client lift outs, as well as regulatory initiatives and contractor conversions to full-time employees and partially offset by other reductions from Beacon. Information systems and communications expenses increased 6% in 2017 compared to 2016.  The increases were primarily related to technology infrastructure costs and investments supporting Beacon. Information systems and communications expenses increased 8% in 2016 compared to 2015. The increase was primarily related to investments supporting new business and Beacon, and the impact of the GEAM business acquired in 2016. Other expenses decreased 2% in 2017 compared to 2016, primarily due to lower professional services costs. Other expenses decreased 28% in 2016 compared to 2015.  The decrease was primarily due to lower litigation-related expenses and higher expenses in 2015 associated with the previously disclosed expense billing matter. As a systemically important financial institution, we are subject to enhanced supervision and prudential standards.  Our status as a G-SIB has also resulted in heightened prudential and conduct expectations of our U.S. and international regulators with respect to our capital and liquidity management and our compliance and risk oversight programs.  These heightened expectations have increased our regulatory compliance costs, including personnel and systems, as well as significant additional implementation and related costs to enhance our regulatory compliance programs.  We anticipate that these evolving regulatory compliance requirements and expectations will continue to affect our expenses. Acquisition Costs We recorded acquisition costs of $21 million, $69 million and $20 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  In 2017, all such costs related to our acquisition of the GEAM business on July 1, 2016. Restructuring Charges In connection with Beacon, we announced in 2016 that we expected: (i) to incur aggregate pre-tax restructuring charges of approximately $300 million to $400 million beginning in 2016 through December 31, 2020 including approximately $250 million to $300 million in severance and benefits costs associated with targeted staff reductions (a substantial portion of which would result in future cash expenditures) and State Street Corporation | 60 Table of Contents MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS approximately $50 million to $100 million in information technology application rationalization and real estate actions; and (ii) to achieve estimated annual pre-tax net run-rate expense savings of $550 million by the end of 2020, relative to 2015, all else equal, for full effect in 2021.  Actual expenses may increase or decrease in the future due to other factors. In 2017, we recorded restructuring charges of $245 million, compared to $142 million in 2016, related to Beacon.  In aggregate, we have recorded restructuring charges of $387 million related to Beacon, including $280 million in severance costs and $107 million in information technology application rationalization and real estate action. In 2017, we achieved approximately $150 million in year-over-year expense savings related to Beacon and expect target savings of $550 million to be realized by mid-2019. The following table presents aggregate restructuring activity for the periods indicated.TABLE 7: RESTRUCTURING CHARGES (In millions) Employee Related Costs   Real Estate Actions   Asset and Other Write-offs   Total Accrual Balance at December 31, 2014 $ 39     $ 23     $ 7     $ 69   Accruals for Business Operations and IT (5 )   (3 )   13     5   Payments and other adjustments (25 )   (9 )   (17 )   (51 ) Accrual Balance at December 31, 2015 $ 9     $ 11     $ 3     $ 23   Accruals for Business Operations and IT (2 )    -       -      (2 ) Accruals for Beacon 94     18     30     142   Payments and other adjustments (64 )   (12 )   (31 )   (107 ) Accrual Balance at December 31, 2016 $ 37     $ 17     $ 2     $ 56   Accruals for Beacon 186     32     27     245   Payments and Other Adjustments (57 )   (17 )   (26 )   (100 ) Accrual Balance at December 31, 2017 $ 166     $ 32     $ 3     $ 201 Income Tax Expense Income tax expense (benefit) was $722 million in 2017, $(22) million in 2016 and $318 million in 2015.  Our 2017 effective tax rate was 24.9%,  compared to (1.0)% in 2016 and 13.8% in 2015.   The 2017 income tax expense includes a one-time estimated tax expense of $250 million for the provisional impact of the enactment of the TCJA.  Actual effects of the TCJA may differ from these estimates, among other things, due to additional tax and regulatory guidance and changes in our assumptions and interpretations.  The 2016 benefit included a reduction in accrued tax expense attributable to retained foreign earnings and tax benefits from capital actions involving our overseas affiliates. Additional information regarding income tax expense, including unrecognized tax benefits, and tax contingencies are provided in Notes 13 and 22 to the consolidated financial statements under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Form 10-K.

Servicing fees in 2016 included a revenue reduction of $48 million related to reimbursements to our clients related to the manner in which we invoiced certain expenses to our clients. Servicing fees decreased 2% in 2016 compared to 2015, primarily due to lower international market levels. Servicing fees generated outside the U.S. were approximately 45% of total servicing fees in 2017 compared to approximately 42% in both 2016 and 2015.

The increase in total AUCA as of December 31, 2017 compared to December 31, 2016 primarily resulted from higher global equity markets.  Asset levels as of December 31, 2017 do not reflect the approximately $350 billion of new business in assets to be installed, which was awarded to us in 2017 and prior periods but not installed prior to December 31, 2017, including approximately $445 billion of new asset servicing mandates awarded to us in 2017.  This new business will be reflected in AUCA in future periods after installation and will generate servicing State Street Corporation | 62 Table of Contents MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS fee revenue in subsequent periods.  The $350 billion of new business assets to be serviced does not include new business which has been contracted, but for which the client has not yet provided permission to publicly disclose and is not yet installed.  Also not included is the loss of business which occurs from time to time or changes in AUCA, usually from changes in market values of customer assets, subscriptions or redemptions from our customer investment products. With respect to these new assets, we will provide various services, including, accounting, bank loan servicing, compliance reporting and monitoring, custody, depository banking services, foreign exchange, fund administration, hedge fund servicing, middle-office outsourcing, performance and analytics, private equity administration, real estate administration, securities finance, transfer agency, and wealth management services. As a result of a decision to diversify providers, one of our large clients will move a portion of its assets, largely common trust funds, currently with State Street to another service provider.  We expect to remain a significant service provider to this client. The transition will principally occur in 2018 and beyond and represents approximately $1 trillion in assets with respect to which we will no longer derive revenue post-transition. Trading Services Trading services revenue is composed of revenue generated by FX trading, as well as revenue generated by brokerage and other trading services as noted in Table 2: Total Revenue. Foreign Exchange Trading Revenue We primarily earn FX trading revenue by acting as a principal market-maker through both ""direct sales and trading"" and ""indirect foreign exchange trading.""  Direct sales and trading: Represent FX transactions at negotiated rates with clients and investment managers that contact our trading desk directly.  These principal market-making activities include transactions for funds serviced by third party custodians or prime brokers, as well as those funds under custody at State Street.  Indirect FX trading: Represent FX transactions with clients or their investment managers routed to our FX desk through our asset-servicing operation; in which all cases, we are the funds' custodian.  We execute indirect FX trades as a principal at rates disclosed to our clients. Our FX trading revenue is influenced by multiple factors, including: the volume and type of client FX transactions and related spreads; currency volatility, reflecting market conditions; and our management of exchange rate, interest rate and other market risks associated with our foreign exchange activities.  The relative impact of these factors on our total FX trading revenues often differs from period to period.  For example, assuming all other factors remain constant, increases or decreases in volumes or bid-offer spreads across product mix tend to result in increases or decreases, as the case may be, in client-related FX revenue. Our clients that utilize indirect FX trading can, in addition to executing their FX transactions through dealers not affiliated with us, transition from indirect FX trading to either direct sales and trading execution, including our ""Street FX"" service, or to one of our electronic trading platforms.  Street FX, in which we continue to act as a principal market-maker, enables our clients to define their FX execution strategy and automate the FX trade execution process, both for funds under custody with us as well as those under custody at another bank. Brokerage and Other Trading Services We also offer a range of brokerage and other trading products tailored specifically to meet the needs of the global pension community, including transition management and commission recapture.   These products and services are generally offered by us as agent of the institutional investor.  Revenue earned from these services is recorded in other trading, transition management and brokerage revenue within brokerage and other trading services revenue. Total brokerage and other trading services revenue primarily consists of ""electronic FX services"" and ""other trading, transition management and brokerage revenue.""  Electronic FX services: Our clients may choose to execute FX transactions through one of our electronic trading platforms.  These transactions generate revenue through a ""click"" fee.  Other trading, transition management and brokerage revenue: As our clients look to State Street to enhance and preserve portfolio values, they may choose to utilize our Transition or Currency Management capabilities or transact with our Equity Trade execution group.  These transactions generate revenue via commissions charged for trades transacted during the management of these portfolios. In recent years, our transition management revenue was adversely affected by compliance issues in our U.K. business during 2010 and 2011, including settlements with the FCA in 2014 and the DOJ and State Street Corporation | 63 Table of Contents MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS SEC in 2017, including a deferred prosecution agreement.  The reputational and regulatory impact of those compliance issues continues and may adversely affect our results in future periods. Securities Finance Our securities finance business consists of three components: (1) an agency lending program for SSGA-managed investment funds with a broad range of investment objectives, which we refer to as the SSGA lending funds; (2) an agency lending program for third-party investment managers and asset owners, which we refer to as the agency lending funds; and (3) security lending transactions which we enter into as principal, which we refer to as our enhanced custody business. Securities finance revenue earned from our agency lending activities, which is composed of our split of both the spreads related to cash collateral and the fees related to non-cash collateral, is principally a function of the volume of securities on loan, the interest-rate spreads and fees earned on the underlying collateral, and our share of the fee split. As principal, our enhanced custody business borrows securities from the lending client or other market participants and then lends such securities to the subsequent borrower, either a State Street client or a broker/dealer.  We act as principal when the lending client is unable to, or elects not to, transact directly with the market and execute the transaction and furnish the securities.  In our role as principal, we provide support to the transaction through our credit rating.  While we source a significant proportion of the securities furnished by us in our role as principal from third parties, we have the ability to source securities through assets under custody and administration from clients who have designated State Street as an eligible borrower. Securities finance revenue as presented in Table 8: Investment Servicing Line of Business Results, increased 8% in 2017 compared to 2016, primarily as a result of higher revenue in our enhanced custody business. Market influences may continue to affect client demand for securities finance, and as a result our revenue from, and the profitability of, our securities lending activities in future periods.  In addition, the constantly evolving regulatory environment, including revised or proposed capital and liquidity standards, and interpretations of those standards, may influence modifications to the way in which we deliver our agency lending or enhanced custody businesses, the volume of our securities lending activity and related revenue and profitability in future periods. Processing Fees and Other Processing fees and other revenue includes diverse types of fees and revenue, including fees from our structured products business, fees from software licensing and maintenance, equity income from our joint venture investments, gains and losses on sales of other assets, derivative financial instruments to support our clients' needs and to manage our interest-rate and currency risk, and amortization of our tax-advantaged investments. Processing fees and other revenue, presented in Table 8: Investment Servicing Line of Business Results, increased 102% in 2017 compared to 2016.  The increase is primarily due to a pre-tax gain of $30 million on the dispositions of our joint venture interests in IFDS U.K. and BFDS in the first quarter of 2017 and the sale of an equity trading platform business in the third quarter of 2017, partially offset by a pre-tax gain of approximately $53 million related to the sale of WM/Reuters in 2016. Processing fees and other revenue decreased 65% in 2016 compared to 2015.  The decrease was primarily due to a gain from the sale of commercial real estate and a gain from the final paydown of a commercial real estate loan in 2015, partially offset by a pre-tax gain on the sale of WM/Reuters in 2016. Expenses Total expenses for Investment Servicing increased 1% in 2017 compared to 2016, primarily due to costs to support new business, higher annual merit and performance based incentive compensation, including higher seasonal deferred incentive compensation expense for retirement eligible employees and payroll taxes in the first quarter of 2017 compared to the first quarter of 2016.  These increases were partially offset by Beacon savings and a one-time acceleration of compensation expense of approximately $42 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Additional information about expenses is provided under ""Expenses"" in ""Consolidated Results of Operations"" included in this Management's Discussion and Analysis of this Form 10-K.

SSGA offers an array of investment management strategies, including passive and active, such as enhanced indexing, using quantitative and fundamental methods for both U.S. and global equity and fixed income securities.  SSGA also offers ETFs, such as the SPDR® ETF brand.  While certain management fees are directly determined by the values of AUM and the investment strategies employed, management fees reflect other factors as well, including our relationship pricing for clients who use multiple services, and the benchmarks specified in the respective management agreements related to performance fees. Management fees increased 25% in 2017 compared to 2016, primarily due to the full year of acquired GEAM business compared to a half year in 2016, higher global equity markets and higher revenue yielding ETF inflows. Management fees increased 10% in 2016 compared to 2015, primarily due to the acquired GEAM business in the second half of 2016. Management fees generated outside the U.S. were approximately 28% of total management fees in 2017, compared to 32% and 35% in 2016 and 2015, respectively.  The percentage of management fees generated outside the U.S. in 2017 decreased from 2016 primarily due to the acquired GEAM business.

The preceding table does not include approximately $20 billion of new asset management business which was awarded but not installed as of December 31, 2017.  New business will be reflected in AUM in future periods after installation, and will generate management fee revenue in subsequent periods.  Total AUM as of December 31, 2017 included managed assets lost but not liquidated.  Lost business occurs from time to time and it is difficult to predict the timing of client behavior in transitioning these assets as the timing can vary significantly. State Street Corporation | 67 Table of Contents MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Expenses Total expenses for Investment Management increased 6% in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to  the full year of the acquired GEAM business compared to a half year in 2016, higher annual merit and performance based incentive compensation, including higher seasonal deferred incentive compensation expense for retirement eligible employees and payroll taxes in the first quarter of 2017 compared to the first quarter of 2016, and higher costs to support new business.  These increases were partially offset by a one-time acceleration of compensation expense of approximately $81 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 and Beacon savings. Additional information about expenses is provided under ""Expenses"" in ""Consolidated Results of Operations"" included in this Management's Discussion and Analysis of this Form 10-K. FINANCIAL CONDITION The structure of our consolidated statement of condition is primarily driven by the liabilities generated by our Investment Servicing and Investment Management lines of business.  Our clients' needs and our operating objectives determine balance sheet volume, mix, and currency denomination.  As our clients execute their worldwide cash management and investment activities, they utilize deposits and short-term investments that constitute the majority of our liabilities.  These liabilities are generally in the form of interest-bearing transaction account deposits, which are denominated in a variety of currencies; non-interest-bearing demand deposits; and repurchase agreements, which generally serve as short-term investment alternatives for our clients. Deposits and other liabilities resulting from client initiated transactions are invested in assets that generally have contractual maturities significantly longer than our liabilities; however, we evaluate the operational nature of our deposits and seek to maintain appropriate short-term liquidity of those liabilities that are not operational in nature and maintain longer-termed assets for our operational deposits.  Our assets consist primarily of securities held in our AFS or HTM portfolios and short-duration financial instruments, such as interest-bearing deposits with banks and securities purchased under resale agreements.  The actual mix of assets is determined by the characteristics of the client liabilities and our desire to maintain a well-diversified portfolio of high-quality assets.

(2) Includes securities at amortized cost or fair value on the date of transfer from AFS. Additional information about our investment securities portfolio is provided in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K. We manage our investment securities portfolio to align with the interest-rate and duration characteristics of our client liabilities that we consider to be operational deposits and in the context of the overall structure of our consolidated statement of condition, in consideration of the global interest-rate environment.  We consider a well-diversified, high-credit quality investment securities portfolio to be an important element in the management of our consolidated statement of condition. Average duration of our investment securities portfolio increased to 2.7 years as of December 31, 2017, compared to 2.5 years as of December 31, 2016.  The increase is primarily driven by the deployment of non-U.S. cash into foreign securities. In 2017, we sold $12.2 billion of AFS, primarily Agency MBS and U.S. Treasury securities in our investment portfolio, to position for the then-existing interest rate environment resulting in a pre-tax loss of $39 million. In 2017, $496 million of Agency MBS previously classified as AFS were transferred to HTM, and in 2016, $4.9 billion of Agency MBS and Student Loan ABS previously classified as AFS were transferred to HTM.  Both transfers reflect our intent to hold these securities until their maturity.  These securities were transferred at fair value, which included a net unrealized loss of $2.8 million and a net unrealized gain of $87 million as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, within accumulated other comprehensive loss which will be accreted into interest income over the remaining life of the transferred security (ranging from approximately 10 to 42 years). Approximately 90% of the carrying value of the portfolio was rated ""AAA"" or ""AA"" as of December 31, 2017 and 91% as of December 31, 2016.

(2) Included approximately $75 million and $80 million as of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively, related to Italy, Portugal and Norway, all of which were related to MBS and auto loans. Approximately 80% and 88% of the aggregate carrying value of these non-U.S. debt securities was rated ""AAA"" or ""AA"" as of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively.  The majority of these securities comprised senior positions within the security structures; these positions have a level of protection provided through subordination and other forms of credit protection.  As of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, approximately 61% and 65%, respectively, of the aggregate carrying value of these non-U.S. debt securities was floating-rate, and accordingly, we consider these securities to have minimal interest-rate risk. As of December 31, 2017, our non-U.S. debt securities had an average market-to-book ratio of 100.4%, and an aggregate pre-tax net unrealized gain of approximately $114 million, composed of gross unrealized gains of $180 million and gross unrealized losses of $66 million.  These unrealized amounts included;  a pre-tax net unrealized gain of $35 million, composed of gross unrealized gains of $95 million and gross unrealized losses of $60 million, associated with non-U.S. debt securities available-for-sale and;  a pre-tax net unrealized gain of $79 million, composed of gross unrealized gains of $85 million and gross unrealized losses of $6 million, associated with non-U.S. debt securities held-to-maturity. As of December 31, 2017, the underlying collateral for non-U.S. MBS and ABS primarily included Australian, Dutch, Italian and U.K. prime mortgages and German auto loans.  The securities listed under ""Canada"" were composed of Canadian government securities and corporate debt and covered bonds.  The securities listed under ""France"" were composed of auto loans, prime mortgages, and corporate debt and covered bonds.  The securities listed under ""Japan"" were substantially composed of Japanese government securities and corporate debt.

State Street Corporation | 72 Table of Contents MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Impairment Impairment exists when the fair value of an individual security is below its amortized cost basis.  Impairment of a security is further assessed to determine whether such impairment is other-than-temporary.  For AFS and HTM debt securities, we record impairment in our consolidated statement of income when management intends to sell (or may be required to sell) the securities before they recover in value, or when management expects the present value of cash flows expected to be collected from the securities to be less than the amortized cost of the impaired security (a credit loss). We conduct periodic reviews of individual securities to assess whether OTTI exists.  Our assessment of OTTI involves an evaluation of economic and security-specific factors.  Such factors are based on estimates, derived by management, which contemplate current market conditions and security-specific performance.  To the extent that market conditions are worse than management's expectations or due to idiosyncratic bond performance, OTTI could increase, in particular the credit-related component that would be recorded in our consolidated statement of income. We recorded less than $1 million of OTTI in 2017 and $2 million in 2016.  Management considers the aggregate decline in fair value of the remaining investment securities and the resulting gross unrealized losses of $657 million as of December 31, 2017 to be temporary and not the result of any material changes in the credit characteristics of the securities.  Additional information with respect to OTTI, net impairment losses and gross unrealized losses is provided in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K. Our evaluation of potential OTTI of structured credit securities with collateral in the U.K. and continental Europe takes into account the outcome from the Brexit referendum and other geopolitical events, and assumes no disruption of payments on these securities.

As of both December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, our investment in senior secured loans totaled approximately $3.5 billion.  In addition, we had binding unfunded commitments as of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 of $279 million and $76 million, respectively, to participate in such syndications. These senior secured loans, which are primarily rated ""speculative"" under our internal risk-rating framework (refer to Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements included under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, in this Form 10-K), are externally rated ""BBB,"" ""BB"" or ""B,"" with approximately 89% and 92% of the loans rated ""BB"" or ""B"" as of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively. Our investment strategy involves generally limiting our investment to larger, more liquid credits underwritten by major global financial institutions, applying our internal credit analysis process to each potential investment, and diversifying our exposure by counterparty and industry segment. However, these loans have significant exposure to credit losses relative to higher-rated loans. Loans to municipalities included in the commercial and financial segment were $2.1 billion and $1.4 billion as of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively. As of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, unearned income deducted from our investment in leveraged lease financing was $75 million and $94 million, respectively, for U.S. leases and $159 million and $192 million, respectively, for non-U.S. leases.

(2) The charge-offs are related to commercial and financial loans. The provision of $2 million and the charge-offs of $1 million recorded in 2017 were associated with our exposure to senior secured loans to non-investment grade institutional borrowers, which were purchased in connection with our participation in syndicated loans. As of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, approximately $47 million and $44 million, respectively, of our allowance for loan and lease losses were related to senior secured loans included in the commercial and financial segment.  As this portfolio grows and matures, our allowance for loan and lease losses related to these loans may increase through additional provisions for credit losses. The remaining $7 million and $9 million as of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively, were related to other components of commercial and financial loans. Cross-Border Outstandings Cross-border outstandings are amounts payable to us by non-U.S. counterparties which are denominated in U.S. dollars or other non-local currency, as well as non-U.S. local currency claims not funded by local currency liabilities.  Our cross-border outstandings consist primarily of deposits with banks; loans and lease financing, including short-duration advances; investment securities; amounts related to foreign exchange and interest-rate contracts; and securities finance.   In addition to credit risk, cross-border outstandings have the risk that, as  a result of political or economic conditions in a country, borrowers may be unable to meet their contractual repayment obligations of principal and/or interest when due because of the unavailability of, or restrictions on, foreign exchange needed by borrowers to repay their obligations. State Street Corporation | 74 Table of Contents MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS As market and economic conditions change, the major independent credit rating agencies may downgrade U.S. and non-U.S. financial institutions and sovereign issuers which have been, and may in the future be, significant counterparties to us, or whose financial instruments serve as collateral on which we rely for credit risk mitigation purposes, and may do so again in the future.  As a result, we may be exposed to increased counterparty risk, leading to negative ratings volatility. The cross-border outstandings presented in Table 28: Cross-Border Outstandings, represented approximately 26%, 28% and 25% of our consolidated total assets as of December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 respectively.

As of December 31, 2015, aggregate cross-border outstandings in countries which amounted to between 0.75% and 1% of our consolidated assets totaled approximately $2.20 billion to the Netherlands. Risk Management General In the normal course of our global business activities, we are exposed to a variety of risks, some inherent in the financial services industry, others more specific to our business activities.  Our risk management framework focuses on material risks, which include the following:  credit and counterparty risk;  liquidity risk, funding and management;  operational risk;  information technology risk;  market risk associated with our trading activities;  market risk associated with our non-trading activities, which we refer to as asset-and-liability management, and which consists primarily of interest-rate risk;  strategic risk;  model risk; and  reputational, fiduciary and business conduct risk. Many of these risks, as well as certain factors underlying each of these risks that could affect our businesses and our consolidated financial statements, are discussed in detail under Item 1A, Risk Factors, of this Form 10-K. The scope of our business requires that we balance these risks with a comprehensive and well-integrated risk management function. The identification, assessment, monitoring, mitigation and reporting of risks are essential to our financial performance and successful management of our businesses. These risks, if not effectively managed, can result in losses to State Street as well as erosion of our capital and damage to our reputation. Our approach, including Board and senior management oversight and a system of policies, procedures, limits, risk measurement and monitoring and internal controls, allows for an assessment of risks within a framework for evaluating opportunities for the prudent use of capital that appropriately balances risk and return. Our objective is to optimize our return while operating at a prudent level of risk. In support of this objective, we have instituted a risk appetite framework that aligns our business strategy and financial objectives with the level of risk that we are willing to incur. Our risk management is based on the following major goals:  A culture of risk awareness that extends across all of our business activities; State Street Corporation | 75 Table of Contents MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  The identification, classification and quantification of State Street's material risks;  The establishment of our risk appetite and associated limits and policies, and our compliance with these limits;  The establishment of a risk management structure at the ""top of the house"" that enables the control and coordination of risk-taking across the business lines;  The implementation of stress testing practices and a dynamic risk-assessment capability;  A direct link between risk and strategic-decision making processes and incentive compensation practices; and  The overall flexibility to adapt to the ever-changing business and market conditions. Our risk appetite framework outlines the quantitative limits and qualitative goals that define our risk appetite, as well as the responsibilities for measuring and monitoring risk against limits, and for reporting, escalating, approving and addressing exceptions.  Our risk appetite framework is established by ERM, a corporate risk oversight group, in conjunction with the MRAC and the RC of the Board. The Board formally reviews and approves our risk appetite statement annually, or more frequently as required. The risk appetite framework describes the level and types of risk that we are willing to accommodate in executing our business strategy, and also serves as a guide in setting risk limits across our business units. In addition to our risk appetite framework, we use stress testing as another important tool in our risk management practice.  Additional information with respect to our stress testing process and practices is provided under ""Capital"" under Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis, of this Form 10-K. Disclosures about our management of significant risks can be found on the following pages within this Form 10-K. Form 10-K Page Number Governance and Structure 76 Credit Risk Management 80 Liquidity Risk Management 85 Operational Risk Management 90 Information Technology Risk Management 93 Market Risk Management 94 Model Risk Management 101 Strategic Risk Management 102 Governance and Structure We have an approach to risk management that involves all levels of management, from the Board and its committees, including its E&A Committee, RC,  the ECC, as well as the Technology Committee, to each business unit and each employee.  We allocate responsibility for risk oversight so that risk/return decisions are made at an appropriate level, and are subject to robust and effective review and challenge. Risk management is the responsibility of each employee, and is implemented through three lines of defense: the business units, which own and manage the risks inherent in their business, are considered the first line of defense; ERM and other support functions, such as Compliance, Finance and Vendor Management, provide the second line of defense; and Corporate Audit, which assesses the effectiveness of the first two lines of defense. The responsibilities for effective review and challenge reside with senior managers, management oversight committees, Corporate Audit and, ultimately, the Board and its committees.  While we believe that our risk management program is effective in managing the risks in our businesses, internal and external factors may create risks that cannot always be identified or anticipated. Corporate-level risk committees provide focused oversight, and establish corporate standards and policies for specific risks, including credit, sovereign exposure, market, liquidity, operational, information technology as well as new business products, regulatory compliance and ethics, vendor risk and model risks.  These committees have been delegated the responsibility to develop recommendations and remediation strategies to address issues that affect or have the potential to affect State Street. We maintain a risk governance committee structure which serves as the formal governance mechanism through which we seek to undertake the consistent identification, management and mitigation of various risks facing State Street in connection with its business activities. This governance structure is enhanced and integrated through multi-disciplinary involvement, particularly through ERM. The following chart presents this structure.

ERM provides risk oversight, support and coordination to allow for the consistent identification, measurement and management of risks across business units separate from the business units' activities, and is responsible for the formulation and maintenance of corporate-wide risk management policies and guidelines.  In addition, ERM establishes and reviews limits and, in collaboration with business unit management, monitors key risks. Ultimately, ERM works to validate that risk-taking occurs within the risk appetite statement approved by the Board and conforms to associated risk policies, limits and guidelines. The CRO is responsible for State Street's risk management globally, leads ERM and has a dual reporting line to State Street's CEO and the Board's RC. ERM manages its responsibilities globally through a three-dimensional organization structure:  ""Vertical"" business unit-aligned risk groups that support business managers with risk management, measurement and monitoring activities;   ""Horizontal"" risk groups that monitor the risks that cross all of our business units (for example, credit and operational risk); and  Risk oversight for international activities, which combines intersecting ""Verticals"" and ""Horizontals"" through a hub and spoke model to provide important regional and legal entity perspectives to the global risk framework. Sitting on top of this three-dimensional organization structure is a centralized group responsible for the aggregation of risk exposures across the vertical, horizontal and regional dimensions, for consolidated reporting, for setting the corporate-level risk appetite framework and associated limits and policies, and for dynamic risk assessment across State Street. State Street Corporation | 77 Table of Contents MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Board Committees The Board has four committees which assist it in discharging its responsibilities with respect to risk management: the RC, the E&A Committee, the ECC, and the Technology Committee. The RC is responsible for oversight related to the operation of our global risk management framework, including policies and procedures establishing risk management governance and processes and risk control infrastructure for our global operations. The RC is responsible for reviewing and discussing with management our assessment and management of all risks applicable to our operations, including credit, market, interest rate, liquidity, operational and business risks, as well as compliance and reputational risk and related policies. In addition, the RC provides oversight on strategic capital governance principles and controls, resolution planning, and monitors capital adequacy in relation to risk.  The RC is also responsible for discharging the duties and obligations of the Board under applicable Basel and other regulatory requirements. The E&A Committee oversees management's operation of our comprehensive system of internal controls covering the integrity of our consolidated financial statements and reports, compliance with laws, regulations and corporate policies.  The E&A Committee acts on behalf of the Board in monitoring and overseeing the performance of Corporate Audit and in reviewing certain communications with banking regulators.  The E&A Committee has direct responsibility for the appointment, compensation, retention, evaluation and oversight of the work of our independent registered public accounting firm, including sole authority for the establishment of pre-approval policies and procedures for all audit engagements and any non-audit engagements. The ECC has direct responsibility for the oversight of all compensation plans, policies, and programs of State Street in which executive officers participate and incentive, retirement, welfare as well as equity plans in which certain other employees of State Street participate.  In addition, the ECC oversees the alignment of our incentive compensation arrangements with our safety and soundness, including the integration of risk management objectives, and related policies, arrangements and control processes consistent with applicable related regulatory rules and guidance. The Technology Committee leads and assists in the Board's oversight of the role of technology in executing State Street's strategy and supporting State Street's global business and operational requirements.  The Technology Committee reviews the use of technology in our activities and operations, as well as significant technology and technology-related strategies, investments and policies.  In addition, the Technology Committee reviews and approves technology and technology-related risk matters, including information and cyber security. Executive Management Committees MRAC is the senior management decision-making body for risk and capital issues, and oversees our financial risks, our consolidated statement of condition, and our capital adequacy, liquidity and recovery and resolution planning.  Its responsibilities include:  The approval of the policies of our global risk, capital and liquidity management frameworks, including our risk appetite framework;  The monitoring and assessment of our capital adequacy based on internal policies and regulatory requirements;  The oversight of our firm-wide risk identification, model risk governance, stress testing and Recovery and Resolution Plan programs; and  The ongoing monitoring and review of risks undertaken within the businesses, and our senior management oversight and approval of risk strategies and tactics. MRAC, is co-chaired by our CRO and CFO, who regularly present to the RC on developments in the risk environment and performance trends in our key business areas. BCRC provides additional risk governance and leadership, by overseeing our business practices in terms of our compliance with laws, regulations and our standards of business conduct, our commitments to clients and others with whom we do business, and potential reputational risks.  Management considers adherence to high ethical standards to be critical to the success of our business and to our reputation.  The BCRC is co-chaired by our CAO and our Chief Legal Officer. TORC oversees and assesses the effectiveness of corporate-wide technology and operational risk management programs, to manage and control technology and operational risk consistently across the organization.  TORC is co-chaired by the CAO and the Chief Information Officer.

Credit Risk Management Core Policies and Principles We define credit risk as the risk of financial loss if a counterparty, borrower or obligor, collectively referred to as a counterparty, is either unable or unwilling to repay borrowings or settle a transaction in accordance with underlying contractual terms.  We assume credit risk in our traditional non-trading lending activities, such as loans and contingent commitments, in our investment securities portfolio, where recourse to a counterparty exists, and in our direct and indirect trading activities, such as principal securities lending and foreign exchange and indemnified agency securities lending.  We also assume credit risk in our day-to-day treasury and securities and other settlement operations, in the form of deposit placements and other cash balances, with central banks or private sector institutions. We distinguish between three major types of credit risk:  Default risk - the risk that a counterparty fails to meet its contractual payment obligations;  Country risk - the risk that we may suffer a loss, in any given country, due to any of the following reasons: deterioration of economic conditions, political and social upheaval, nationalization and appropriation of assets, government repudiation of indebtedness, exchange controls, and disruptive currency depreciation or devaluation; and  Settlement risk - the risk that the settlement or clearance of transactions will fail, which arises whenever the exchange of cash, securities and/or other assets is not simultaneous. The acceptance of credit risk by State Street is governed by corporate policies and guidelines, which include standardized procedures applied across the entire organization. These policies and guidelines include specific requirements related to each counterparty's risk profile; the markets served; State Street Corporation | 80 Table of Contents MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS counterparty, industry and country concentrations; and regulatory compliance. These policies and procedures also implement a number of core principles, which include the following:  We measure and consolidate credit risks to each counterparty, or group of counterparties, in accordance with a ""one-obligor"" principle that aggregates risks across our business units;  ERM reviews and approves all extensions of credit, or material changes to extensions of credit (such as changes in term, collateral structure or covenants), in accordance with assigned credit-approval authorities;  Credit-approval authorities are assigned to individuals according to their qualifications, experience and training, and these authorities are periodically reviewed.  Our largest exposures require approval by the Credit Committee, a sub-committee of the CRPC.  With respect to small and low-risk extensions of credit to certain types of counterparties, approval authority is granted to individuals outside of ERM;  We seek to avoid or limit undue concentrations of risk. Counterparty (or groups of counterparties), industry, country and product-specific concentrations of risk are subject to frequent review and approval in accordance with our risk appetite;  We determine the creditworthiness of counterparties through a detailed risk assessment, including the use of comprehensive internal risk-rating methodologies;  We review all extensions of credit and the creditworthiness of counterparties at least annually.  The nature and extent of these reviews are determined by the size, nature and term of the extensions of credit and the creditworthiness of the counterparty; and  We subject all corporate policies and guidelines to annual review as an integral part of our periodic assessment of our risk appetite. Our corporate policies and guidelines require that the business units which engage in activities that give rise to credit and counterparty risk comply with procedures that promote the extension of credit for legitimate business purposes; are consistent with the maintenance of proper credit standards; limit credit-related losses; and are consistent with our goal of maintaining a strong financial condition. Structure and Organization The Credit Risk group within ERM is responsible for the assessment, approval and monitoring of credit risk across State Street. The group is managed centrally, has dedicated teams in a number of locations worldwide across our businesses, and is responsible for related policies and procedures, and for our internal credit-rating systems and methodologies. In addition, the group, in conjunction with the business units, establishes appropriate measurements and limits to control the amount of credit risk accepted across its various business activities, both at the portfolio level and for each individual counterparty or group of counterparties, to individual industries, and also to counterparties by product and country of risk. These measurements and limits are reviewed periodically, but at least annually. In conjunction with other groups in ERM, the Credit Risk group is jointly responsible for the design, implementation and oversight of our credit risk measurement and management systems, including data and assessment systems, quantification systems and the reporting framework. Various key committees within State Street are responsible for the oversight of credit risk and associated credit risk policies, systems and models.  All credit-related activities are governed by our risk appetite framework and our credit risk guidelines, which define our general philosophy with respect to credit risk and the manner in which we control, manage and monitor such risks. The previously described CRPC (refer to ""Risk Committees"") has primary responsibility for the oversight, review and approval of the credit risk guidelines and policies.  Credit risk guidelines and policies are reviewed periodically, but at least annually. The Credit Committee, a sub-committee of the CRPC, has responsibility for assigning credit authority and approving the largest and higher-risk extensions of credit to individual counterparties or groups of counterparties. CRPC provides periodic updates to MRAC and the Board's RC. Credit Ratings We perform initial and ongoing reviews to exercise due diligence on the creditworthiness of our counterparties when conducting any business with them or approving any credit limits. This due diligence process generally includes the assignment of an internal credit rating, which is determined by the use of internally developed and validated methodologies, scorecards and a 15-grade rating scale. This risk-rating process incorporates the State Street Corporation | 81 Table of Contents MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS use of risk-rating tools in conjunction with management judgment; qualitative and quantitative inputs are captured in a replicable manner and, following a formal review and approval process, an internal credit rating based on our rating scale is assigned. Credit ratings are reviewed and approved by the Credit Risk group or designees within ERM.  To facilitate comparability across the portfolio, counterparties within a given sector are rated using a risk-rating tool developed for that sector. Our risk-rating methodologies are approved by the CRPC, after completion of internal model validation processes, and are subject to an annual review, including re-validation. We generally rate our counterparties individually, although accounts defined by us as low-risk are rated on a pooled basis.  We evaluate and rate the credit risk of our counterparties on an ongoing basis. Risk Parameter Estimates Our internal risk-rating system promotes a clear and consistent approach to the determination of appropriate credit risk classifications for our credit counterparties and exposures, tracking the changes in risk associated with these counterparties and exposures over time. This capability enhances our ability to more accurately calculate both risk exposures and capital, enabling better strategic decision making across the organization. We use credit risk parameter estimates for the following purposes:  The assessment of the creditworthiness of new counterparties and, in conjunction with our risk appetite statement, the development of appropriate credit limits for our products and services, including loans, foreign exchange, securities finance, placements and repurchase agreements;  The use of an automated process for limit approvals for certain low-risk counterparties, as defined in our credit risk guidelines, based on the counterparty's probability-of-default, or PD, rating class;  The development of approval authority matrices based on PD; riskier counterparties with higher ratings require higher levels of approval for a comparable PD and limit size compared to less risky counterparties with lower ratings;  The analysis of risk concentration trends using historical PD and exposure-at-default, or EAD, data;  The standardization of rating integrity testing by GCR using rating parameters;  The determination of the level of management review of short-duration advances depending on PD; riskier counterparties with higher rating class values generally trigger higher levels of management escalation for comparable short-duration advances compared to less risky counterparties with lower rating-class values;  The monitoring of credit facility utilization levels using EAD values and the identification of instances where counterparties have exceeded limits;  The aggregation and comparison of counterparty exposures with risk appetite levels to determine if businesses are maintaining appropriate risk levels; and  The determination of our regulatory capital requirements for the AIRB provided in the Basel framework. Credit Risk Mitigation We seek to limit our credit exposure and reduce our potential credit losses through various types of risk mitigation.  In our day-to-day management of credit risks, we utilize and recognize the following types of risk mitigation. Collateral In many parts of our business, we regularly require or agree for collateral to be received from or provided to clients and counterparties in connection with contracts that incur credit risk.  In our trading businesses, this collateral is typically in the form of cash and highly-rated securities (government securities and other bonds or equity securities).  Credit risks in our non-trading and securities finance businesses are also often secured by bonds and equity securities and by other types of assets. Collateral serves to reduce the risk of loss inherent in an exposure by improving the prospect of recovery in the event of a counterparty default.  However, rapidly changing market values of the collateral we hold, unexpected increases in the credit exposure to a client or counterparty, reductions in the value or change in the type of securities held by us, as well as operational errors or errors in the manner in which we seek to exercise our rights, may reduce the risk mitigation effects of collateral or result in other security interests not being effective to reduce potential credit exposure.  While collateral is often an alternative source of repayment, it generally does not replace the requirement within our policies and guidelines for high-quality underwriting standards.  We also may choose to incur credit exposure without the benefit of collateral or other risk mitigating credits rights. Our credit risk guidelines require that the collateral we accept for risk mitigation purposes is of high quality, can be reliably valued and can be State Street Corporation | 82 Table of Contents MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS liquidated if or when required.  Generally, when collateral is of lower quality, more difficult to value or more challenging to liquidate, higher discounts to market values are applied for the purposes of measuring credit risk.  For certain less liquid collateral, longer liquidation periods are assumed when determining the credit exposure. All types of collateral are assessed regularly by ERM, as is the basis on which the collateral is valued.  Our assessment of collateral, including the ability to liquidate collateral in the event of a counterparty default, and also with regard to market values of collateral under a variety of hypothetical market conditions, is an integral component of our assessment of risk and approval of credit limits.  We also seek to identify, limit and monitor instances of ""wrong-way"" risk, where a counterparty's risk of default is positively correlated with the risk of our collateral eroding in value. We maintain policies and procedures requiring that documentation used to collateralize a transaction is legal, valid, binding and enforceable in the relevant jurisdictions.  We also conduct legal reviews to assess whether our documentation meets these standards on an ongoing basis. Netting Netting is a mechanism that allows institutions and counterparties to net offsetting exposures and payment obligations against one another through the use of qualifying master netting agreements.  A master netting agreement allows the netting of rights and obligations arising under derivative or other transactions that have been entered into under such an agreement upon the counterparty's default, resulting in a single net claim owed by, or to, the counterparty.  This is commonly referred to as ""close-out netting,"" and is pursued wherever possible.  We may also enter into master agreements that allow for the netting of amounts payable on a given day and in the same currency, reducing our settlement risk.  This is commonly referred to as ""payment netting,"" and is widely used in our foreign exchange activities. As with collateral, we have policies and procedures in place to apply close-out and payment netting only to the extent that we have verified legal validity and enforceability of the master agreement.  In the case of payment netting, operational constraints may preclude us from reducing settlement risk, notwithstanding the legal right to require the same under the master netting agreement. Guarantees A guarantee is a financial instrument that results in credit support being provided by a third party, (i.e., the protection provider) to the underlying obligor (the beneficiary of the provided protection) on account of an exposure owing by the obligor. The protection provider may support the underlying exposure either in whole or in part. Support of this kind may take different forms. Typical forms of guarantees provided to State Street include financial guarantees, letters of credit, bankers' acceptances, PUA contracts and insurance. We have established a review process to evaluate guarantees under the applicable requirements of State Street policies and Basel III requirements. Governance for this evaluation is covered under policies and procedures that require regular reviews of documentation, jurisdictions, and credit quality of protection providers. Pursuant to the Basel III final rule, we are permitted to reflect the application of credit risk mitigation which may include, for example, guarantees, collateral, netting, secured interests in non-financial assets and credit default swaps. State Street does not actively use credit default swaps as a risk mitigation tool, although it increasingly applies the recognition of guarantees, collateral and security over non-financial assets to mitigate overall risk within its counterparty credit portfolio. Credit Limits Central to our philosophy for our management of credit risk is the approval and imposition of credit limits, against which we monitor the actual and potential future credit exposure arising from our business activities with counterparties or groups of counterparties.  Credit limits are a reflection of our risk appetite, which may be determined by the creditworthiness of the counterparty, the nature of the risk inherent in the business undertaken with the counterparty, or a combination of relevant credit factors.  Our risk appetite for certain sectors and certain countries and geographic regions may also influence the level of risk we are willing to assume to certain counterparties. The analysis and approval of credit limits is undertaken in a consistent manner across our businesses, although the nature and extent of the analysis may vary, based on the type, term and magnitude of the risk being assumed.  Credit limits and underlying exposures are assessed and measured on both a gross and net basis where appropriate, with net exposure determined by deducting the value of any collateral held. For certain types of risk being assumed, we will also assess and measure exposures under a variety of hypothetical market conditions. Credit limit approvals across State Street are undertaken by the Credit Risk group, by individuals to whom credit authority has been delegated, or by the Credit Committee. Credit limits are re-evaluated annually, or more frequently as needed, and are revised periodically on State Street Corporation | 83 Table of Contents MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS prevailing and anticipated market conditions, changes in counterparty or country-specific credit ratings and outlook, changes in State Street's risk appetite for certain counterparties, sectors or countries, and enhancements to the measurement of credit utilization. Reporting Ongoing active monitoring and management of our credit risk is an integral part of our credit risk management framework.  We maintain management information systems to identify, measure, monitor and report credit risk across businesses and legal entities, enabling ERM and our businesses to have timely access to accurate information on credit limits and exposures.  Monitoring is performed along the dimensions of counterparty, industry, country and product-specific risks to facilitate the identification of concentrations of risk and emerging trends. Key aspects of this credit risk reporting structure include governance and oversight groups, policies that define standards for the reporting of credit risk, data aggregation and sourcing systems, and separate testing of relevant risk reporting functions by Corporate Audit. The Credit Portfolio Management group routinely assesses the composition of our overall credit risk portfolio for alignment with our stated risk appetite.  This assessment includes routine analysis and reporting of the portfolio, monitoring of market-based indicators, the assessment of industry trends and developments, and regular reviews of concentrated risks.  The Credit Portfolio Management group is also responsible, in conjunction with the business units, for defining the appetite for credit risk in the major sectors in which we have a concentration of business activities.  These sector-level risk appetite statements, which include counterparty selection criteria and granular underwriting guidelines, are reviewed periodically and approved by the CRPC. Monitoring Regular surveillance of credit and counterparty risks is undertaken by our business units, the Credit Risk group and designees with ERM, allowing for frequent and extensive oversight.  This surveillance process includes, but is not limited to, the following components:  Annual Reviews.  A formal review of counterparties is conducted at least annually and includes a thorough review of operating performance, primary risk factors and our internal credit risk rating.  This annual review also includes a review of current and proposed credit limits, an assessment of our ongoing risk appetite and verification that supporting legal documentation remains effective.  Interim Monitoring.  Periodic monitoring of our largest and riskiest counterparties is undertaken more frequently, utilizing financial information, market indicators and other relevant credit and performance measures.  The nature and extent of this interim monitoring is individually tailored to certain counterparties and/or industry sectors to identify material changes to the risk profile of a counterparty (or group of counterparties) and assign an updated internal risk rating in a timely manner. We maintain an active ""watch list"" for all counterparties where we have identified a concern that the actual or potential risk of default has increased. The watch list status denotes a concern with some aspect of a counterparty's risk profile that warrants closer monitoring of the counterparty's financial performance and related risk factors. Our ongoing monitoring processes are designed to facilitate the early identification of counterparties whose creditworthiness is deteriorating; any counterparty may be placed on the watch list by ERM at its sole discretion. Counterparties that receive an internal risk rating within a certain range on our rating scale are eligible for watch list designation.  These risk ratings generally correspond with the non-investment grade or near non-investment grade ratings established by the major independent credit-rating agencies,  and also include the regulatory classifications of ""Special Mention,"" ""Substandard,"" ""Doubtful"" and ""Loss.""  Counterparties whose internal ratings are outside this range may also be placed on the watch list. The Credit Risk group maintains primary responsibility for our watch list processes, and generates a monthly report of all watch list counterparties. The watch list is formally reviewed at least on a quarterly basis, with participation from senior ERM staff, and representatives from the business units and our corporate finance and legal groups as appropriate. These meetings include a review of individual watch list counterparties, together with credit limits and prevailing exposures, and are focused on actions to contain, reduce or eliminate the risk of loss to State Street. Identified actions are documented and monitored. Controls GCR provides a separate level of surveillance and oversight over the integrity of our credit risk management processes, including the internal risk-rating system. GCR reviews counterparty credit ratings for all identified sectors on an ongoing basis. GCR is subject to oversight by the CRPC, and provides periodic updates to the Board's RC. State Street Corporation | 84 Table of Contents MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Specific activities of GCR include the following:  Separate and objective assessments of our credit and counterparty exposures to determine the nature and extent of risk undertaken by the business units;  Periodic credit process and credit product reviews, focusing on and assessing credit analysis, policy compliance, prudent transaction structure and underwriting standards, administration and documentation, risk-rating integrity, and relevant trends;  Identification and monitoring of developing counterparty, market and/or industry sector trends to limit risk of loss and protect capital;  Regular and formal reporting of reviews, including findings and requisite actions to remedy identified deficiencies;  Allocation of resources for specialized risk assessments (on an as-needed basis);  Assessment of the level of the allowance for loan and lease losses and OTTI; and  Liaison with auditors and regulatory personnel on matters relating to risk rating, reporting, and measurement. Reserve for Credit Losses We maintain an allowance for loan and lease losses to support our on-balance sheet credit exposures.  We also maintain a reserve for unfunded commitments and letters of credit to support our off-balance credit exposure.  The two components together represent the reserve for credit losses.  Review and evaluation of the adequacy of the reserve for credit losses is ongoing throughout the year, but occurs at least quarterly, and is based, among other factors, on our evaluation of the level of risk in the portfolio, the volume of adversely classified loans, previous loss experience, current trends, and economic conditions and their effect on our counterparties.  Additional information about the allowance for loan and lease losses is provided in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements included under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Form 10-K. Liquidity Risk Management Liquidity risk is defined as the potential that our financial condition or overall viability could be adversely affected by an actual or perceived inability to meet cash and collateral obligations.  The goal of liquidity risk management is to maintain, even in the event of stress, our ability to meet our cash and collateral obligations. Liquidity is managed to meet our financial obligations in a timely and cost-effective manner, as well as maintain sufficient flexibility to fund strategic corporate initiatives as they arise.  Our effective management of liquidity involves the assessment of the potential mismatch between the future cash demands of our clients and our available sources of cash under both normal and adverse economic and business conditions. We manage our liquidity on a global, consolidated basis.  We also manage liquidity on a stand-alone basis at the Parent Company and at State Street Bank, as well as at certain branches and subsidiaries of State Street Bank.  State Street Bank generally has access to markets and funding sources limited to banks, such as the federal funds market and the Federal Reserve's discount window.  Our Parent Company is managed to a more conservative liquidity profile, reflecting narrower market access.  Our Parent Company typically maintains access to enough cash, primarily in the form of interest-bearing deposits or time deposits with its banking subsidiaries and access to borrowing from SSIF, to meet its current debt maturities and cash needs, as well as those projected over the next one-year period.  As of December 31, 2017, the value of our Parent Company's net liquid assets totaled $0.53 billion, compared with $3.64 billion as of December 31, 2016, reflecting the contribution of liquid assets to SSIF in July 2017 in accordance with the support agreement.  At December 31, 2017, the value of SSIF's net liquid assets totaled $2.88 billion.  As of December 31, 2017, our Parent Company has approximately $1.4 billion of senior notes outstanding that will mature in the next twelve months. Based on our level of consolidated liquid assets and our ability to access the capital markets for additional funding when necessary, including our ability to issue debt and equity securities under our current universal shelf registration, management considers our overall liquidity as of December 31, 2017 to be sufficient to meet its current commitments and business needs, including accommodating the transaction and cash management needs of its clients. Governance Global Treasury is responsible for our management of liquidity.  This includes the day-to-day management of our global liquidity position, the development and monitoring of early warning indicators, key liquidity risk metrics, the creation and execution of stress tests, the evaluation and implementation of regulatory requirements, the maintenance and execution of our liquidity guidelines and contingency funding plan, and routine management reporting to ALCO, MRAC and the Board's RC. Global Treasury Risk Management, part of ERM, provides separate oversight over the identification, communication, and management of Global State Street Corporation | 85 Table of Contents MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Treasury's risks in support of our business strategy.  Global Treasury Risk Management reports to the CRO.  Global Treasury Risk Management's responsibilities relative to liquidity risk management include the development and review of policies and guidelines; the monitoring of limits related to adherence to the liquidity risk guidelines and associated reporting. Liquidity Framework Our liquidity framework contemplates areas of potential risk based on our activities, size, and other appropriate risk-related factors.  In managing liquidity risk we employ limits, maintain established metrics and early warning indicators, and perform routine stress testing to identify potential liquidity needs.  This process involves the evaluation of a combination of internal and external scenarios which assist us in measuring our liquidity position and in identifying potential increases in cash needs or decreases in available sources of cash, as well as the potential impairment of our ability to access the global capital markets. We manage liquidity according to several principles that are equally important to our overall liquidity risk management framework:  Structural liquidity management addresses liquidity by monitoring and directing the composition of our consolidated statement of condition.  Structural liquidity is measured by metrics such as the percentage of total wholesale funds to consolidated total assets, and the percentage of non-government investment securities to client deposits.  In addition, on a regular basis and as described below, our structural liquidity is evaluated under various stress scenarios.  Tactical liquidity management addresses our day-to-day funding requirements and is largely driven by changes in our primary source of funding, which are client deposits.  Fluctuations in client deposits may be supplemented with short-term borrowings, which generally include commercial paper and certificates of deposit.  Stress testing and contingent funding planning are longer-term strategic liquidity risk management practices.  Regular and ad hoc liquidity stress testing are performed under various severe but plausible scenarios at the consolidated level and at significant subsidiaries, including State Street Bank.  These tests contemplate severe market and State Street-specific events under various time horizons and severities.  Tests contemplate the impact of material changes in key funding sources, credit ratings, additional collateral requirements, contingent uses of funding, systemic shocks to the financial markets, and operational failures based on market and State Street-specific assumptions.  The stress tests evaluate the required level of funding versus available sources in an adverse environment.  As stress testing contemplates potential forward-looking scenarios, results also serve as a trigger to activate specific liquidity stress levels and contingent funding actions. CFPs are designed to assist senior management with decision-making associated with any contingency funding response to a possible or actual crisis scenario.  The CFPs define roles, responsibilities and management actions to be taken in the event of deterioration of our liquidity profile caused by either a State Street-specific event or a broader disruption in the capital markets.  Specific actions are linked to the level of stress indicated by these measures or by management judgment of market conditions. Liquidity Risk Metrics In managing our liquidity, we employ early warning indicators and metrics.  Early warning indicators are intended to detect situations which may result in a liquidity stress, including changes in our common stock price and the spread on our long-term debt.  Additional metrics that are critical to the management of our consolidated statement of condition and monitored as part of our routine liquidity management include measures of our fungible cash position, purchased wholesale funds, unencumbered liquid assets, deposits, and the total of investment securities and loans as a percentage of total client deposits. Asset Liquidity Central to the management of our liquidity is asset liquidity, which consists primarily of unencumbered highly liquid securities, cash and cash equivalents reported on our consolidated statement of condition.  We restrict the eligibility of securities of asset liquidity to U.S. Government and federal agency securities (including MBS), selected non-U.S. Government and supranational securities as well as certain other high- quality securities which generally are more liquid than other types of assets even in times of stress.  Our asset liquidity metric is similar to the HQLA under the U.S. LCR, and our HQLA, under the LCR final rule definition, were estimated to be $65.35 billion and $87.20 billion as of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively. State Street Corporation | 86 Table of Contents MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS TABLE 29: COMPONENTS OF AVERAGE HQLA BY TYPE OF ASSET (In millions)   December 31, 2017   December 31, 2016 Excess Central Bank Balances   $ 33,584     $ 48,407   U.S. Treasuries   10,278     17,770   Other Investment securities   13,422     15,442   Foreign government   8,064     5,585   Total   $ 65,348     $ 87,204 With respect to highly liquid short-term investments presented in the preceding table, due to the continued elevated level of client deposits as of December 31, 2017, we maintained cash balances in excess of regulatory requirements governing deposits with the Federal Reserve of approximately $33.58 billion at the Federal Reserve, the ECB and other non-U.S. central banks, compared to $48.40 billion as of December 31, 2016.  The lower levels of deposits with central banks as of December 31, 2017 compared to December 31, 2016 was due to normal deposit volatility. Liquid securities carried in our asset liquidity include securities pledged without corresponding advances from the FRBB, the FHLB, and other non-U.S. central banks. State Street Bank is a member of the FHLB.  This membership allows for advances of liquidity in varying terms against high-quality collateral, which helps facilitate asset-and-liability management. Access to primary, intra-day and contingent liquidity provided by these utilities is an important source of contingent liquidity with utilization subject to underlying conditions.  As of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, we had no outstanding primary credit borrowings from the FRBB discount window or any other central bank facility, and as of the same dates, no FHLB advances were outstanding. In addition to the securities included in our asset liquidity, we have significant amounts of other unencumbered investment securities.  The aggregate fair value of those securities was $66.10 billion as of December 31, 2017, compared to $54.40 billion as of December 31, 2016.  These securities are available sources of liquidity, although not as rapidly deployed as those included in our asset liquidity. Measures of liquidity include LCR, NSFR and TLAC which are described in ""Supervision and Regulation"" included under Item 1, Business, of this Form 10-K. Uses of Liquidity Significant uses of our liquidity could result from the following: withdrawals of client deposits; draw-downs of unfunded commitments to extend credit or to purchase securities, generally provided through lines of credit; and short-duration advance facilities.  Such circumstances would generally arise under stress conditions including deterioration in credit ratings.  A recurring significant use of our liquidity involves our deployment of HQLA from our investment portfolio to post collateral to financial institutions and participants in our agency lending program serving as sources of securities under our enhanced custody program. We had unfunded commitments to extend credit with gross contractual amounts totaling $26.49 billion and $26.99 billion as of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively.  These amounts do not reflect the value of any collateral.  As of December 31, 2017, approximately 72% of our unfunded commitments to extend credit expire within one year.  Since many of our commitments are expected to expire or renew without being drawn upon, the gross contractual amounts do not necessarily represent our future cash requirements. Information about our resolution planning and the impact actions under our resolution plans could have on our liquidity is provided in ""Supervision and Regulation,"" included under Item 1. Business, of this Form 10-K. Funding Deposits We provide products and services including custody, accounting, administration, daily pricing, foreign exchange services, cash management, financial asset management, securities finance and investment advisory services.  As a provider of these products and services, we generate client deposits, which have generally provided a stable, low-cost source of funds.  As a global custodian, clients place deposits with State Street entities in various currencies.  As of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, approximately 60% of our average client deposit balances were denominated in U.S. dollars, approximately 20% in EUR, 10% in GBP and 10% in all other currencies. For the past several years, we have frequently experienced higher client deposit inflows toward the end of each fiscal quarter or the end of the fiscal year.  As a result, we believe average client deposit balances are more reflective of ongoing funding than period-end balances. TABLE 30: TOTAL DEPOSITS       Average Balance   December 31   Years Ended December 31, (In millions) 2017   2016   2017   2016 Client deposits $ 180,149     $ 176,693     $ 158,996     $ 156,029   Wholesale CDs 4,747     10,470     4,812     14,456   Total deposits $ 184,896     $ 187,163     $ 163,808     $ 170,485 State Street Corporation | 87 Table of Contents MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Short-Term Funding Our on-balance sheet liquid assets are also an integral component of our liquidity management strategy.  These assets provide liquidity through maturities of the assets, but more importantly, they provide us with the ability to raise funds by pledging the securities as collateral for borrowings or through outright sales.  In addition, our access to the global capital markets gives us the ability to source incremental funding at reasonable rates of interest from wholesale investors.  As discussed earlier under ""Asset Liquidity,"" State Street Bank's membership in the FHLB allows for advances of liquidity with varying terms against high-quality collateral. Short-term secured funding also comes in the form of securities lent or sold under agreements to repurchase.  These transactions are short-term in nature, generally overnight, and are collateralized by high-quality investment securities.  These balances were $2.84 billion and $4.40 billion as of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively. State Street Bank currently maintains a line of credit with a financial institution of CAD 1.40 billion, or approximately $1.11 billion as of December 31, 2017, to support its Canadian securities processing operations.  The line of credit has no stated termination date and is cancelable by either party with prior notice.  As of December 31, 2017, there was no balance outstanding on this line of credit. Long-Term Funding We have the ability to issue debt and equity securities under our current universal shelf registration to meet current commitments and business needs, including accommodating the transaction and cash management needs of our clients.  In addition, State Street Bank, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Parent Company, also has authorization to issue up to $5 billion in unsecured senior debt and an additional $500 million of subordinated debt. Agency Credit Ratings Our ability to maintain consistent access to liquidity is fostered by the maintenance of high investment-grade ratings as measured by the major independent credit rating agencies. Factors essential to maintaining high credit ratings include:  diverse and stable core earnings;  relative market position;  strong risk management;  strong capital ratios;  diverse liquidity sources, including the global capital markets and client deposits;  strong liquidity monitoring procedures; and  preparedness for current or future regulatory developments. High ratings limit borrowing costs and enhance our liquidity by:  providing assurance for unsecured funding and depositors;  increasing the potential market for our debt and improving our ability to offer products;  serving markets; and  engaging in transactions in which clients value high credit ratings. A downgrade or reduction of our credit ratings could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity by restricting our ability to access the capital markets, which could increase the related cost of funds.  In turn, this could cause the sudden and large-scale withdrawal of unsecured deposits by our clients, which could lead to draw-downs of unfunded commitments to extend credit or trigger requirements under securities purchase commitments; or require additional collateral or force terminations of certain trading derivative contracts. A majority of our derivative contracts have been entered into under bilateral agreements with counterparties who may require us to post collateral or terminate the transactions based on changes in our credit ratings.  We assess the impact of these arrangements by determining the collateral that would be required assuming a downgrade by all rating agencies.  The additional collateral or termination payments related to our net derivative liabilities under these arrangements that could have been called by counterparties in the event of a downgrade in our credit ratings below levels specified in the agreements is disclosed in Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements included under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Form 10-K. Other funding sources, such as secured financing transactions and other margin requirements, for which there are no explicit triggers, could also be adversely affected.

Operational Risk Management Overview Operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems or from external events. Operational risk encompasses fiduciary risk and legal risk. Fiduciary risk is defined as the risk that State Street fails to properly exercise its fiduciary duties in its provision of products or services to clients.  Legal risk is the risk of loss resulting from failure to comply with laws and contractual obligations as well as prudent ethical standards in business practices in addition to exposure to litigation from all aspects of State Street's activities. Operational risk is inherent in the performance of investment servicing and investment management activities on behalf of our clients.  Whether it be fiduciary risk, risk associated with execution and processing or other types of operational risk, a consistent, transparent and effective operational risk framework is key to identifying, monitoring and managing operational risk. We have established an operational risk framework that is based on three major goals: Strong, active governance; Ownership and accountability; and Consistency and transparency. Governance Our Board is responsible for the approval and oversight of our overall operational risk framework.  It does so through its RC, which reviews our operational risk framework and approves our operational risk policy annually. Our operational risk policy establishes our approach to our management of operational risk across State Street.  The policy identifies the responsibilities of individuals and committees charged with oversight of the management of operational risk, and articulates a broad mandate that supports implementation of the operational risk framework. ERM and other control groups provide the oversight, validation and verification of the management and measurement of operational risk. Executive management actively manages and oversees our operational risk framework through membership on various risk management committees, including MRAC, the BCRC, TORC, the Operational Risk Committee, the Executive Information Security Committee, Business Controls Steering Committee, Compliance and Ethics Committee, and the Fiduciary Review Committee, all of which ultimately report to the appropriate committee of the Board. The Operational Risk Committee, chaired by the global head of Operational Risk and co-chaired by the FLOD Head of Business Controls, provides cross-business oversight of operational risk, operational risk programs and their implementation to identify, measure, manage and control operational risk in an effective and consistent manner and reviews and approves operational risk guidelines intended to maintain a consistent implementation of our corporate operational risk policy and framework. Ownership and Accountability We have implemented our operational risk framework to support the broad mandate established by our operational risk policy.  This framework represents an integrated set of processes and tools that assists us in the management and measurement of operational risk, including our calculation of required capital and RWA. State Street Corporation | 90 Table of Contents MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The framework takes a comprehensive view and integrates the methods and tools used to manage and measure operational risk.  The framework utilizes aspects of the COSO framework and other industry leading practices, and is designed foremost to address State Street's risk management needs while complying with regulatory requirements. The operational risk framework is intended to provide a number of important benefits, including:  A common understanding of operational risk management and its supporting processes;  The clarification of responsibilities for the management of operational risk across State Street;  The alignment of business priorities with risk management objectives;  The active management of risk and early identification of emerging risks;  The consistent application of policies and the collection of data for risk management and measurement; and  The estimation of our operational risk capital requirement. The operational risk framework employs a distributed risk management infrastructure executed by ERM groups aligned with the business units, which are responsible for the implementation of the operational risk framework at the business unit level. As with other risks, senior business unit management is responsible for the day-to-day operational risk management of their respective businesses.  It is business unit management's responsibility to provide oversight of the implementation and ongoing execution of the operational risk framework within their respective organizations, as well as coordination and communication with ERM. Consistency and Transparency A number of corporate control functions are directly responsible for implementing and assessing various aspects of State Street's operational risk framework, with the overarching goal of consistency and transparency to meet the evolving needs of the business:  The global head of Operational Risk, a member of the CRO's executive management team, leads ERM's corporate ORM group. ORM is responsible for the strategy, evolution and consistent implementation of our operational risk guidelines, framework and supporting tools across State Street.  ORM reviews and analyzes operational key risk information, events, metrics and indicators at the business unit and corporate level for purposes of risk management, reporting and escalation to the CRO, senior management and governance committees;  ERM's Corporate Risk Analytics group develops and maintains operational risk capital estimation models, and ORM's Capital Analysis group calculates State Street's required capital for operational risk;  ERM's MVG independently validates the quantitative models used to measure operational risk, and ORM performs validation checks on the output of the model;  CIS establishes the framework, policies and related programs to measure, monitor and report on information security risks, including the effectiveness of cyber security program protections.  CIS defines and manages the enterprise-wide information security program.  CIS coordinates with Information Technology, control functions and business units to support the confidentiality, integrity and availability of corporate information assets. CIS identifies and employs a risk-based methodology consistent with applicable regulatory cyber security requirements and monitors the compliance of our systems with information security policies; and  Corporate Audit performs separate reviews of the application of operational risk management practices and methodologies utilized across State Street. Our operational risk framework consists of five components, each described below, which provide a working structure that integrates distinct risk programs into a continuous process focused on managing and measuring operational risk in a coordinated and consistent manner. Risk Identification and  Assessments The objective of risk identification and assessments is to understand business unit strategy, risk profile and potential exposures.  It is achieved through a series of risk assessments across State Street using techniques for the identification, assessment and measurement of risk across a spectrum of potential frequency and severity combinations.  Three primary risk assessment programs, which occur annually, augmented by other business-specific programs, are the core of this component:  The RCSA program seeks to understand the risks associated with day-to-day activities, and the effectiveness of controls intended to manage potential exposures arising from these activities. These risks are typically frequent in nature but generally not severe in terms of exposure; State Street Corporation | 91 Table of Contents MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  The Material Risk Identification process utilizes a bottom-up approach to identify State Street's most significant risk exposures across all on- and off-balance sheet risk-taking activities. The program is specifically designed to consider risks that could have a material impact irrespective of their likelihood or frequency. This can include risks that may have an impact on longer-term business objectives, such as significant change management activities or long-term strategic initiatives;  The Scenario Analysis program focuses on the set of risks with the highest severity and most relevance from a capital perspective. These are generally referred to as ""tail risks,"" and serve as important benchmarks for our loss distribution approach model (see below); they also provide inputs into stress testing; and  Business-specific programs to identify, assess and measure risk, including new business and product review and approval, new client screening, and, as deemed appropriate, targeted risk assessments. Capital Analysis The primary measurement tool used is an internally developed loss distribution approach (LDA) model. We use the LDA model to quantify required operational risk capital, from which we calculate RWA related to operational risk.  Such required capital and RWA totaled $3.67 billion and $45.82 billion, respectively, as of December 31, 2017, compared to $3.57 billion and $44.58 billion, respectively, as of December 31, 2016; refer to the ""Capital"" section in ""Financial Condition,"" of this Management's Discussion and Analysis. The LDA model incorporates the four required operational risk elements described below:  Internal loss event data is collected from across State Street in conformity with our operating loss policy that establishes the requirements for collecting and reporting individual loss events.  We categorize the data into seven Basel-defined event types and further subdivide the data by business unit, as deemed appropriate.  Each of these loss events are represented in a UOM which is used to estimate a specific amount of capital required for the types of loss events that fall into each specific category.  Some UOMs are measured at the corporate level because they are not ""business specific,"" such as damage to physical assets, where the cause of an event is not primarily driven by the behavior of a single business unit. Internal losses of $500 or greater are captured, analyzed and included in the modeling approach.  Loss event data is collected using a corporate-wide data collection tool, which stores the data in a Loss Event Data Repository, referred to as the LEDR, to support processes related to analysis, management reporting and the calculation of required capital.  Internal loss event data provides State Street-specific frequency and severity information to our capital calculation process for historical loss events experienced by State Street.  Internal loss event data may be incorporated into our LDA model in a future quarter following the realization of the losses, with the timing and categorization dependent on the processes for model updates and, if applicable, model revalidation and regulatory review and related supervisory processes.  An individual loss event can have a significant effect on the output of our LDA model and our operational risk RWA under the advanced approaches depending on the severity of the loss event, its categorization among the seven Basel-defined UOMs and the stability of the distributional approach for a particular UOM.  External loss event data provides information with respect to loss event severity from other financial institutions to inform our capital estimation process of events in similar business units at other banking organizations. This information supplements the data pool available for use in our LDA model.  Assessments of the sufficiency of internal data and the relevance of external data are completed before pooling the two data sources for use in our LDA model.  Scenario analysis workshops are conducted across State Street to inform management of the less frequent but most severe, or ""tail,"" risks that the organization faces.  The workshops are attended by senior business unit managers, other support and control partners and business-aligned risk management staff.  The workshops are designed to capture information about the significant risks and to estimate potential exposures for individual risks should a loss event occur.  The results of these workshops are used to make a comparison to our LDA model results to determine that our calculation of required capital considers relevant risk-related information.  Business environment and internal control factors are gathered as part of our scenario analysis program to inform the scenario State Street Corporation | 92 Table of Contents MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS analysis workshop participants of internal loss event data and business-relevant metrics, such as RCSA results, along with industry loss event data and case studies where appropriate.  Business environment and internal control factors are those characteristics of a bank's internal and external operating environment that bear an exposure to operational risk.  The use of this information indirectly influences our calculation of required capital by providing additional relevant data to workshop participants when reviewing specific UOM risks. Monitoring, Reporting and Analytics The objective of risk monitoring is to proactively monitor the changing business environment and corresponding operational risk exposure.  It is achieved through a series of quantitative and qualitative monitoring tools that are designed to allow us to understand changes in the business environment, internal control factors, risk metrics, risk assessments, exposures and operating effectiveness, as well as details of loss events and progress on risk initiatives implemented to mitigate potential risk exposures. Operational risk reporting is intended to provide transparency, thereby enabling management to manage risk, provide oversight and escalate issues in a timely manner.  It is designed to allow the business units, executive management, and the Board's control functions and committees to gain insight into activities that may result in risks and potential exposures. Reports are intended to identify business activities that are experiencing processing issues, whether or not they result in actual loss events.  Reporting includes results of monitoring activities, internal and external examinations, regulatory reviews, and control assessments.  These elements combine in a manner designed to provide a view of potential and emerging risks facing State Street and information that details its progress on managing risks. Effectiveness and Testing The objective of effectiveness and testing is to verify that internal controls are designed appropriately, are consistent with corporate and regulatory standards, and are operating effectively.  It is achieved through a series of assessments by both internal and external parties, including Corporate Audit, independent registered public accounting firms, business self-assessments and other control function reviews, such as a SOX testing program. Consistent with our standard model validation process, the operational risk LDA model is subject to a detailed review, overseen by the MRC.  In addition, the model is subject to a rigorous internal governance process.  All changes to the model or input parameters, and the deployment of model updates, are reviewed and approved by the Operational Risk Committee, which has oversight responsibility for the model, with technical input from the MRC. Documentation and Guidelines Documentation and guidelines allow for consistency and repeatability of the various processes that support the operational risk framework across State Street. Operational risk guidelines document our practices and describe the key elements in a business unit's operational risk management program.  The purpose of the guidelines is to set forth and define key operational risk terms, provide further detail on State Street's operational risk programs, and detail the business units' responsibilities to identify, assess, measure, monitor and report operational risk.  The guideline supports our operational risk policy. Data standards have been established to maintain consistent data repositories and systems that are controlled, accurate and available on a timely basis to support operational risk management. Information Technology Risk Management Overview and Principles We define technology risk as the risk associated with the use, ownership, operation, involvement, influence and adoption of information technology. Technology risk includes risks potentially triggered by technology non-compliance with regulatory obligations, information security and privacy incidents, business disruption, technology internal control and process gaps, technology operational events, and adoption of new business technologies. The principal technology risks within our technology risk policy and risk appetite framework include:  Third party vendor risk  Business disruption and technology resiliency risk  Cyber and information security risk  Technology asset and configuration risk  Technology obsolescence risk Governance Our Board is responsible for the approval and oversight of our overall technology risk framework and program. It does so through its Technology Committee, which reviews and approves our technology risk policy and appetite framework annually. Our technology risk policy establishes our approach to our management of technology risk across State Street.  The policy identifies the responsibilities of individuals and committees charged with oversight of the management of technology risk State Street Corporation | 93 Table of Contents MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS and articulates a broad mandate that supports implementation of the technology risk framework. Risk control functions in the business are responsible for adopting and executing the Enterprise Technology Risk Management, or ETRM, technology risk framework and reporting requirements. They do this, in part, by developing and maintaining an inventory of critical applications and supporting infrastructure, as well as identifying, assessing and measuring technology risk utilizing the ETRM framework. They are also responsible for monitoring and evaluating risk on a continual basis using key risk indicators, risk reporting and adopting appropriate risk responses to risk issues. The Chief Technology Risk Officer, a member of the CRO's executive management team, leads the ETRM. ETRM is the separate risk function responsible for the technology risk strategy and appetite, and technology risk framework development and execution.   ETRM also performs overall technology risk monitoring and reporting to the Board, and provides a separate view of the technology risk posture to executive leadership. We manage technology risks by:  Coordinating various risk assessment and risk management activities, including ERM operational risk programs;  Establishing, through TORC and the Technology Committee of the Board, the enterprise level technology risk and cyber risk appetite and limits;  Producing enterprise level risk reporting, aggregation, dashboards, profiles and risk appetite statements;  Validating appropriateness of reporting of information technology risks and risk acceptance to senior management risk committees and the Board;  Promoting a strong technology risk culture through communication;  Serving as an escalation and challenge point for technology risk policy guidance, expectations and clarifications;  Assessing effectiveness of key enterprise information technology risk and internal control remediation programs; and  Providing risk oversight, challenge and monitoring for the Global Continuity and Third Party Vendor Management Program, including the collection of risk appetite, metrics and KRIs, and reviewing issue management processes and consistent program adoption. Market Risk Management Market risk is defined by U.S. banking regulators as the risk of loss that could result from broad market movements, such as changes in the general level of interest rates, credit spreads, foreign exchange rates or commodity prices.  We are exposed to market risk in both our trading and certain of our non-trading, or asset-and-liability management, activities. Information about the market risk associated with our trading activities is provided below under ""Trading Activities.""  Information about the market risk associated with our non-trading activities, which consists primarily of interest-rate risk, is provided below under ""Asset-and-Liability Management Activities."" Trading Activities In the conduct of our trading activities, we assume market risk, the level of which is a function of our overall risk appetite, business objectives and liquidity needs, our clients' requirements and market volatility, and our execution against those factors. We engage in trading activities primarily to support our clients' needs and to contribute to our overall corporate earnings and liquidity.  In connection with certain of these trading activities, we enter into a variety of derivative financial instruments to support our clients' needs and to manage our interest-rate and currency risk.  These activities are generally intended to generate trading services revenue and to manage potential earnings volatility. In addition, we provide services related to derivatives in our role as both a manager and a servicer of financial assets. Our clients use derivatives to manage the financial risks associated with their investment goals and business activities.  With the growth of cross-border investing, our clients often enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to convert currency for international investments and to manage the currency risk in their international investment portfolios.  As an active participant in the foreign exchange markets, we provide foreign exchange forward and option contracts in support of these client needs, and also act as a dealer in the currency markets. As part of our trading activities, we assume positions in the foreign exchange and interest-rate markets by buying and selling cash instruments and entering into derivative instruments, including foreign exchange forward contracts, foreign exchange and interest-rate options and interest-rate swaps, interest-rate forward contracts, and interest-rate futures.  As of December 31, 2017, the notional amount of these derivative contracts was $1.75 trillion, of which $1.68 trillion was composed of foreign exchange forward, swap and spot contracts.  We seek to match positions closely with the objective of minimizing related State Street Corporation | 94 Table of Contents MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS currency and interest-rate risk.  All foreign exchange contracts are valued daily at current market rates. Governance Our assumption of market risk in our trading activities is an integral part of our corporate risk appetite.  Our Board reviews and oversees our management of market risk, including the approval of key market risk policies and the receipt and review of regular market risk reporting, as well as periodic updates on selected market risk topics. The previously described TMRC (refer to ""Risk Committees"") oversees all market risk-taking activities across State Street associated with trading. The TMRC, which reports to MRAC, is composed of members of ERM, our global markets business and our Global Treasury group, as well as our senior executives who manage our trading businesses and other members of management who possess specialized knowledge and expertise.  The TMRC meets regularly to monitor the management of our trading market risk activities. Our business units identify, actively manage and are responsible for the market risks inherent in their businesses.  A dedicated market risk management group within ERM, and other groups within ERM, work with those business units to assist them in the identification, assessment, monitoring, management and control of market risk, and assist business unit managers with their market risk management and measurement activities.  ERM provides an additional line of oversight, support and coordination designed to promote the consistent identification, measurement and management of market risk across business units, separate from those business units' discrete activities. The ERM market risk management group is responsible for the management of corporate-wide market risk, the monitoring of key market risks and the development and maintenance of market risk management policies, guidelines, and standards aligned with our corporate risk appetite.  This group also establishes and approves market risk tolerance limits and trading authorities based on, but not limited to, measures of notional amounts, sensitivity, VaR and stress.  Such limits and authorities are specified in our trading and market risk guidelines which govern our management of trading market risk. Corporate Audit separately assesses the design and operating effectiveness of the market risk controls within our business units and ERM.  Other related responsibilities of Corporate Audit include the periodic review of ERM and business unit compliance with market risk policies, guidelines, and corporate standards, as well as relevant regulatory requirements.  We are subject to regular monitoring, reviews and supervisory exams of our market risk function by the Federal Reserve.  In addition, we are regulated by, among others, the SEC, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority and the U.S. Commodities Futures Trading Commission. Risk Appetite Our corporate market risk appetite is specified in policy statements that outline the governance, responsibilities and requirements surrounding the identification, measurement, analysis, management and communication of market risk arising from our trading activities.  These policy statements also set forth the market risk control framework to monitor, support, manage and control this portion of our risk appetite.  All groups involved in the management and control of market risk associated with trading activities are required to comply with the qualitative and quantitative elements of these policy statements. Our trading market risk control framework is composed of the following components:  A trading market risk management process led by ERM, separate from the business units' discrete activities;  Clearly defined responsibilities and authorities for the primary groups involved in trading market risk management;  A trading market risk measurement methodology that captures correlation effects and allows aggregation of market risk across risk types, markets and business lines;  Daily monitoring, analysis, and reporting of market risk exposures associated with trading activities against market risk limits;  A defined limit structure and escalation process in the event of a market risk limit excess;  Use of VaR models to measure the one-day market risk exposure of trading positions;  Use of VaR as a ten-day-based regulatory capital measure of the market risk exposure of trading positions;  Use of non-VaR-based limits and other controls;  Use of stressed-VaR models, stress-testing analysis and scenario analysis to support the trading market risk measurement and management process by assessing how portfolios and global business lines perform under extreme market conditions;  Use of back-testing as a diagnostic tool to assess the accuracy of VaR models and other risk management techniques; and  A new product approval process that requires market risk teams to assess trading-related market risks and apply risk tolerance limits to State Street Corporation | 95 Table of Contents MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS proposed new products and business activities. We use our CAP to assess our overall capital and liquidity in relation to our risk profile and provide a comprehensive strategy for maintaining appropriate capital and liquidity levels.  With respect to market risk associated with trading activities, our risk management and our calculations of regulatory capital are based primarily on our internal VaR models and stress testing analysis.  As discussed in detail under ""Value-at-Risk"" below, VaR is measured daily by ERM. The TMRC oversees our market risk exposure in relation to limits established within our risk appetite framework. These limits define threshold levels for VaR- and stressed VaR-based measures and are applicable to all trading positions subject to regulatory capital requirements.  These limits are designed to prevent any undue concentration of market risk exposure, in light of the primarily non-proprietary nature of our trading activities.  The risk appetite framework and associated limits are reviewed and approved by the Board's RC. Covered Positions Our trading positions are subject to regulatory market risk capital requirements if they meet the regulatory definition of a ""covered position.""  A covered position is generally defined by U.S. banking regulators as an on- or off-balance sheet position associated with the organization's trading activities that is free of any restrictions on its tradability, but does not include intangible assets, certain credit derivatives recognized as guarantees and certain equity positions not publicly traded.  All FX and commodity positions are considered covered positions, regardless of the accounting treatment they receive.  The identification of covered positions for inclusion in our market risk capital framework is governed by our covered positions policy, which outlines the standards we use to determine whether a trading position is a covered position. Our covered positions consist primarily of the trading portfolios held by our global markets business.  They also arise from certain positions held by our Global Treasury group. These trading positions include products such as foreign exchange spot, foreign exchange forwards, non-deliverable forwards, foreign exchange options, foreign exchange funding swaps, currency futures, financial futures, and interest rate futures. New activities are analyzed to determine if the positions arising from such new activities meet the definition of a covered position and conform to our covered positions policy.  This documented analysis, including any decisions with respect to market risk treatments, must receive approval from the TMRC. We use spot rates, forward points, yield curves and discount factors imported from third-party sources to measure the value of our covered positions, and we use such values to mark our covered positions to market on a daily basis.  These values are subject to separate validation by us in order to evaluate reasonableness and consistency with market experience.  The mark-to-market gain or loss on spot transactions is calculated by applying the spot rate to the foreign currency principal and comparing the resultant base currency amount to the original transaction principal.  The mark-to-market gain or loss on a forward foreign exchange contract or forward cash flow contract is determined as the difference between the life-to-date (historical) value of the cash flow and the value of the cash flow at the inception of the transaction.  The mark-to-market gain or loss on interest-rate swaps is determined by discounting the future cash flows from each leg of the swap transaction. Value-at-Risk, Stress Testing and Stressed VaR As noted above, we use a variety of risk measurement tools and methodologies, including VaR, which is an estimate of potential loss for a given period within a stated statistical confidence interval.  We use a risk measurement methodology to measure trading-related VaR daily. We have adopted standards for measuring trading-related VaR, and we maintain regulatory capital for market risk associated with our trading activities in conformity with currently applicable bank regulatory market risk requirements. We utilize an internal VaR model to calculate our regulatory market risk capital requirements. We use a historical simulation model to calculate daily VaR- and stressed VaR-based measures for our covered positions in conformity with regulatory requirements.  Our VaR model seeks to capture identified material risk factors associated with our covered positions, including risks arising from market movements such as changes in foreign exchange rates, interest rates and option-implied volatilities. We have adopted standards and guidelines to value our covered positions which govern our VaR- and stressed VaR-based measures.  Our regulatory VaR-based measure is calculated based on historical volatilities of market risk factors during a two-year observation period calibrated to a one-tail, 99% confidence interval and a ten-business-day holding period.  We also use the same platform to calculate a one-tail, 99% confidence interval, one-business-day VaR for internal risk management purposes.  A 99% one-tail confidence interval implies that daily trading losses are not expected to exceed the estimated VaR more than 1% of the time, or less than three business days out of a year. State Street Corporation | 96 Table of Contents MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Our market risk models, including our VaR model, are subject to change in connection with the governance, validation and back-testing processes described below.  These models can change as a result of changes in our business activities, our historical experiences, market forces and events, regulations and regulatory interpretations and other factors.  In addition, the models are subject to continuing regulatory review and approval.  Changes in our models may result in changes in our measurements of our market risk exposures, including VaR, and related measures, including regulatory capital.  These changes could result in material changes in those risk measurements and related measures as calculated and compared from period to period. Value-at-Risk VaR measures are based on the most recent two years of historical price movements for instruments and related risk factors to which we have exposure.  The instruments in question are limited to foreign exchange spot, forward and options contracts and interest-rate contracts, including futures and interest-rate swaps.  Historically, these instruments have exhibited a higher degree of liquidity relative to other available capital markets instruments.  As a result, the VaR measures shown reflect our ability to rapidly adjust exposures in highly dynamic markets.  For this reason, risk inventory, in the form of net open positions, across all currencies is typically limited.  In addition, long and short positions in major, as well as minor, currencies provide risk offsets that limit our potential downside exposure. Our VaR methodology uses a historical simulation approach based on market-observed changes in foreign exchange rates, U.S. and non-U.S. interest rates and implied volatilities, and incorporates the resulting diversification benefits provided from the mix of our trading positions.  Our VaR model incorporates approximately 5,000 risk factors and includes correlations among currency, interest rates, and other market rates. All VaR measures are subject to limitations and must be interpreted accordingly.  Some, but not all, of the limitations of our VaR methodology include the following:  Compared to a shorter observation period, a two-year observation period is slower to reflect increases in market volatility (although temporary increases in market volatility will affect the calculation of VaR for a longer period); consequently, in periods of sudden increases in volatility or increasing volatility, in each case relative to the prior two-year period, the calculation of VaR may understate current risk;  Compared to a longer observation period, a two-year observation period may not reflect as many past periods of volatility in the markets, because such past volatility is no longer in the observation period; consequently, historical market scenarios of high volatility, even if similar to current or likely future market circumstances, may fall outside the two-year observation period, resulting in a potential understatement of current risk;  The VaR-based measure is calibrated to a specified level of confidence and does not indicate the potential magnitude of losses beyond this confidence level;  In certain cases, VaR-based measures approximate the impact of changes in risk factors on the values of positions and portfolios; this may happen because the number of inputs included in the VaR model is necessarily limited; for example, yield curve risk factors do not exist for all future dates;  The use of historical market information may not be predictive of future events, particularly those that are extreme in nature; this ""backward-looking"" limitation can cause VaR to understate or overstate risk;  The effect of extreme and rare market movements is difficult to estimate; this may result from non-linear risk sensitivities as well as the potential for actual volatility and correlation levels to differ from assumptions implicit in the VaR calculations; and  Intra-day risk is not captured. Stress Testing and Stressed VaR We have a corporate-wide stress testing program in place that incorporates an array of techniques to measure the potential loss we could suffer in a hypothetical scenario of adverse economic and financial conditions.  We also monitor concentrations of risk such as concentration by branch, risk component, and currency pairs.  We conduct stress testing on a daily basis based on selected historical stress events that are relevant to our positions in order to estimate the potential impact to our current portfolio should similar market conditions recur, and we also perform stress testing as part of the Federal Reserve's CCAR process.  Stress testing is conducted, analyzed and reported at the corporate, trading desk, division and risk-factor level (for example, exchange risk, interest-rate risk and volatility risk). We calculate a stressed VaR-based measure using the same model we use to calculate VaR, but State Street Corporation | 97 Table of Contents MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS with model inputs calibrated to historical data from a range of continuous twelve-month periods that reflect significant financial stress.  The stressed VaR model identifies the second-worst outcome occurring in the worst continuous one-year rolling period since July 2007.  This stressed VaR meets the regulatory requirement as the rolling ten-day period with an outcome that is worse than 99% of other outcomes during that twelve-month period of financial stress.  For each portfolio, the stress period is determined algorithmically by seeking the one-year time horizon that produces the largest ten-business-day VaR from within the available historical data.  This historical data set includes the financial crisis of 2008, the highly volatile period surrounding the Eurozone sovereign debt crisis and the Standard & Poor's downgrade of U.S. Treasury debt in August 2011.  As the historical data set used to determine the stress period expands over time, future market stress events will be automatically incorporated. We perform scenario analysis daily based on selected historical stress events that are relevant to our positions in order to estimate the potential impact to our current portfolio should similar market conditions recur.  Relevant scenarios are chosen from an inventory of historical financial stresses and applied to our current portfolio.  These historical event scenarios involve spot foreign exchange, credit, equity, unforeseen geo-political events and natural disasters, and government and central bank intervention scenarios.  Examples of the specific historical scenarios we incorporate in our stress testing program may include the Asian financial crisis of 1997, the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks in the U.S., and the 2008 financial crisis.  We continue to update our inventory of historical stress scenarios as new stress conditions emerge in the financial markets. As each of the historical stress events is associated with a different time horizon, we normalize results by scaling down the longer horizon events to a ten-day horizon and keeping the shorter horizon events (i.e., events that are shorter than ten days) at their original terms.  We also conduct sensitivity analysis daily to calculate the impact of a large predefined shock in a specific risk factor or a group of risk factors on our current portfolio.  These predefined shocks include parallel and non-parallel yield curve shifts and foreign exchange spot and volatility surface shifts.  In a parallel shift scenario, we apply a constant factor shift across all yield curve tenors. In a non-parallel shift scenario, we apply different shock levels to different tenors of a yield curve, rather than shifting the entire curve by a constant amount.  Non-parallel shifts include steepening, flattening and butterflies. Stress testing results and limits are actively monitored on a daily basis by ERM and reported to the TMRC.  Limit breaches are addressed by ERM risk managers in conjunction with the business units, escalated as appropriate, and reviewed by the TMRC if material.  In addition, we have established several action triggers that prompt immediate review by management and the implementation of a remediation plan. Validation and Back-Testing We perform frequent back-testing to assess the accuracy of our VaR-based model in estimating loss at the stated confidence level.  This back-testing involves the comparison of estimated VaR model outputs to daily, actual profit-and-loss outcomes, or P&L, observed from daily market movements.  We back-test our VaR model using ""clean"" P&L, which excludes non-trading revenue such as fees, commissions and NII, as well as estimated revenue from intra-day trading. Our VaR definition of trading losses excludes items that are not specific to the price movement of the trading assets and liabilities themselves, such as fees, commissions, changes to reserves and gains or losses from intra-day activity. We experienced one back-testing exception in each of 2017, 2016 and 2015. In reference to the 2017 exception, the trading loss that day exceeded the VaR based on the prior day's closing positions, following the euro's forward point spike on short tenors driven by thinning liquidity and reduced volumes spurred by banks' year-end balance sheet preparations. In reference to the 2016 exception, the trading P&L that day exceeded the VaR based on the prior day's closing positions, following a large depreciation in the U.S. dollar against several major and emerging market currencies, primarily attributable to U.S. GDP growth rate being lower than expected and market reaction to Bank of Japan's decision to leave the interest rate unchanged. In reference to the 2015 exception, the trading P&L that day exceeded the VaR based on the prior day's closing positions, following a large depreciation in the U.S. dollar against several major and emerging market currencies, which depreciation can be attributed to a decision and related statements by the Federal Reserve's Federal Open Market Committee to hold interest rates at current levels. Our model validation process also evaluates the integrity of our VaR models through the use of regular outcome analysis. This outcome analysis includes back-testing, which compares the VaR model's predictions to actual outcomes using out-of-sample information.  MVG examined back testing results for the market risk regulatory capital model used for 2016. Consistent with regulatory guidance, the back-testing compared ""clean"" P&L, defined above, with State Street Corporation | 98 Table of Contents MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS the one-day VaR produced by the model.  The back-testing was performed for a time period not used for model development.  The number of occurrences where ""clean"" trading-book P&L exceeded the one-day VaR was within our expected VaR tolerance level. Market Risk Reporting Our ERM market risk management group is responsible for market risk monitoring and reporting.  We use a variety of systems and controlled market feeds from third-party services to compile data for several daily, weekly, and monthly management reports. The following tables present VaR and stressed VaR associated with our trading activities for covered positions held during the quarters ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, as measured by our VaR methodology: TABLE 34: TEN-DAY VaR ASSOCIATED WITH TRADING ACTIVITIES FOR COVERED POSITIONS   Quarter Ended December 31, 2017   Quarter Ended December 31, 2016   As of December 31, 2017   As of December 31, 2016 (In thousands) Average   Maximum   Minimum   Average   Maximum   Minimum   VaR   VaR Global Markets $ 8,148     $ 13,502     $ 3,402     $ 8,307     $ 15,847     $ 3,048     $ 5,719     $ 4,088   Global Treasury 650     1,767     126     527     756     333     1,346     756   Total VaR $ 8,123     $ 13,306     $ 3,410     $ 8,285     $ 15,723     $ 2,970     $ 5,562     $ 3,938 TABLE 35: TEN-DAY STRESSED VaR ASSOCIATED WITH TRADING ACTIVITIES FOR COVERED POSITIONS   Quarter Ended December 31, 2017   Quarter Ended December 31, 2016   As of December 31, 2017   As of December 31, 2016 (In thousands) Average   Maximum   Minimum   Average   Maximum   Minimum   Stressed VaR   Stressed VaR Global Markets $ 27,185     $ 41,908     $ 14,408     $ 36,168     $ 52,057     $ 18,883     $ 31,512     $ 26,811   Global Treasury 8,761     17,460     2,560     10,275     13,868     7,030     12,042     11,342   Total Stressed VaR $ 27,789     $ 42,527     $ 14,320     $ 38,645     $ 55,899     $ 20,646     $ 29,649     $ 28,624 The average of our stressed VaR-based measure was approximately $28 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, compared to an average of approximately $39 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in our stressed VaR based measure for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, compared to the quarter ended December 31, 2016, was mainly driven by lower end of day foreign exchange positions in Q4 2017 compared to Q4 2016. The VaR-based measures presented in the preceding tables are primarily a reflection of the overall level of market volatility and our appetite for taking market risk in our trading activities.  Overall levels of volatility have been low both on an absolute basis and relative to the historical information observed at the beginning of the period used for the calculations.  Both the ten-day VaR-based measures and the stressed VaR-based measures are based on historical changes observed during rolling ten-day periods for the portfolios as of the close of business each day over the past one-year period. We may in the future modify and adjust our models and methodologies used to calculate VaR and stressed VaR, subject to regulatory review and approval, and these modifications and adjustments may result in changes in our VaR-based and stressed VaR-based measures. The following tables present the VaR and stressed-VaR associated with our trading activities attributable to foreign exchange risk, interest-rate risk and volatility risk as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The totals of the VaR-based and stressed VaR-based measures for the three attributes in total exceeded the related total VaR and total stressed VaR presented in the foregoing tables as of each period-end, primarily due to the benefits of diversification across risk types.

Forwards, futures, options and swaps with maturities greater than period-end have embedded interest-rate risk that is captured by the measures used for interest-rate risk.  Accordingly, the interest-rate risk embedded in these foreign exchange instruments is included in the interest-rate risk component. Asset and Liability Management Activities The primary objective of asset and liability management is to provide sustainable NII under varying economic conditions, while protecting the economic value of the assets and liabilities carried in our consolidated statement of condition from the adverse effects of changes in interest rates. While many market factors affect the level of NII and the economic value of our assets and liabilities, one of the most significant factors is our exposure to movements in interest rates. Most of our NII is earned from the investment of client deposits generated by our businesses.  We invest these client deposits in assets that conform generally to the characteristics of our balance sheet liabilities, including the currency composition of our significant non-U.S. dollar denominated client liabilities. We manage interest rate risk on a consolidated basis using two different, but complementary approaches. NII sensitivity is a short-term, earnings-based simulation that measures re-pricing mismatches on the balance sheet. It compares our baseline view of NII over a twelve-month horizon, based on our internal forecast of interest rates, to a wide range of instantaneous and gradual rate shocks. The baseline NII forecast includes our expectations for new business growth, changes in balance sheet mix and investment portfolio positioning. While investment securities balances can fluctuate with the level of rates as prepayment assumptions change, our deposit balances remain consistent with the baseline. On the other hand, economic value of equity sensitivity is a discounted cash flow model designed to estimate the change in fair value of assets and liabilities under a series of immediate interest rate shocks over a long-term horizon. It measures the duration mismatch of the spot balance sheet only and does not include the impact of new business. While there are clear differences between NII and EVE sensitivity, there are several important similarities. First, both measures utilize consistent data and assumptions when modeling positions currently held on the balance sheet. Second, each approach assumes no management action is taken to mitigate the adverse effects of interest rate changes on our financial performance (and thus provides a conservative view of interest rate risk). NII and EVE sensitivity metrics are continuously monitored as market conditions change and managed within internally-approved risk limits and guidelines. Net Interest Income at Risk In the table below, we report the expected change in NII over the next twelve months from +/-100 bps instantaneous and gradual parallel rate shocks. Note that in each scenario, all currencies are shifted higher or lower. For the two gradual parallel rate scenarios, or interest rate ramps, the change in rates is applied evenly throughout the horizon. We also routinely measure NII sensitivity to non-parallel rate shocks to isolate the impact of short-term or long-term market rates. In the up 100 bps instantaneous shock, approximately 75% of the expected benefit stems from the short-end of the yield curve. Additionally, we quantify how much of the change is a result of shifts in U.S. and non-U.S. rates. In the up 100 bps instantaneous shock, approximately 50-60% of the benefit is driven by U.S. rates. State Street Corporation | 100 Table of Contents MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS TABLE 38: NII SENSITIVITY (In millions)   December 31,  2017   December 31,  2016 Rate change:   Benefit / (Exposure) +100 bps shock   $ 435     $ 585    - 100 bps shock   (294 )   (265 ) +100 bps ramp   177     284    - 100 bps ramp   (122 )   (161 ) As of December 31, 2017, NII sensitivity remains positioned to benefit from rising interest rates. Compared to prior year-end, the decreased benefit to the up 100 bps instantaneous shock is driven by investment portfolio activity and higher forecasted short-end rates, which impacts the repricing characteristics of client deposits and other liabilities. The increased exposure to the down 100 bps instantaneous rate shock is driven by higher observed short-term interest rates relative to prior year-end.  Gradual rate shocks have a similar asset sensitive positioning compared with instantaneous shocks, but are less impactful due to the severity of the rate shift. Economic Value of Equity The following table highlights our economic value of equity sensitivity to a +/-200 bps instantaneous rate shock, relative to spot interest rates.  Management compares the change in EVE sensitivity against State Street's aggregate tier 1 and tier 2 risk-based capital, calculated in conformity with current applicable regulatory requirements. TABLE 39: EVE SENSITIVITY     December 31,  2017   December 31,  2016 (In millions)         Rate change:   Benefit / (Exposure) +200 bps shock   $ (1,507 )   $ (1,092 )  - 200 bps shock   11     877 As of December 31, 2017, economic value of equity sensitivity remains exposed to upward shifts in interest rates. The change in each scenario is driven by investment portfolio repositioning and higher modeled client deposit duration. The -200 bps scenario is also impacted by the low level of rates, which can limit the size of the rate shock. Model Risk Management The use of models is widespread throughout the financial services industry, with large and complex organizations relying on sophisticated models to support numerous aspects of their financial decision making. The models contemporaneously represent both a significant advancement in financial management and a new source of risk. In large banking organizations like State Street, model results influence business decisions, and model failure could have a harmful effect on our financial performance. As a result, the Model Risk Management Framework seeks to mitigate model risk at State Street. Our model risk management program has three principal components:  A model risk governance program that defines roles and responsibilities, including the authority to restrict model usage, provides policies and guidance, monitors compliance, and reports regularly to the Board on the overall degree of model risk across the corporation;  A model development process that focuses on sound design and computational accuracy, and includes activities designed to test for robustness, stability, and sensitivity to assumptions; and  An independent model validation function designed to verify that models are conceptually sound, computationally accurate, are performing as expected, and are in line with their design objectives. Governance Models used in the regulatory capital calculation can only be deployed for use after undergoing a model validation by ERM's Model Risk Management and receiving the result on the validation that allows for use. ERM's Model Risk Management group is responsible for defining the corporate-wide model risk governance framework, and maintains policies that achieve the framework's objectives.  The team is responsible for overall model risk governance capabilities, with particular emphasis in the areas of model validation, model risk reporting, model performance monitoring, tracking of new model development status, and committee-level review and challenge. MRC, which is composed of senior staff with technical expertise, reports to MRAC, and provides guidance and oversight to the Model Risk Management function. Model Development and Usage Models are developed under standards governing data sourcing, methodology selection and model integrity testing. Model development includes a statement of purpose to align development with intended use. It also includes a comparison of alternative approaches to promote a sound modeling approach. Model developers conduct an assessment of data quality and relevance.  The development teams conduct a variety of tests of the accuracy, robustness and stability of each model. State Street Corporation | 101 Table of Contents MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Model owners submit models to the Model Validation Group for validation on a regular basis, as per existing policy. Model Validation MVG is part of Model Risk Management within ERM and performs model validations.  MVG is independent, as contemplated by applicable bank regulatory requirements, of both the developers and users of the models.  MVG validates models through a review process that assesses the appropriateness, accuracy, and suitability of data inputs, methodologies, assumptions, and processing code. Model validation also encompasses an assessment of model performance, sensitivity, and robustness, as well as a model's potential limitations given its particular assumptions or deficiencies.  Based on the results of its review, MVG issues a model use decision and may require remedial actions and compensating controls on model use. MVG also maintains a model risk-rating system, which assigns a risk rating to each model based on an assessment of a model's inherent and residual risks.  These ratings aid in the understanding and reporting of model risk across the model portfolio, and enable the triaging of needs for remediation. Although model validation is the primary method of subjecting models to independent review and challenge, in practice, a multi-step governance process provides the opportunity for challenge by multiple parties.  First, MVG conducts model validation and issues a model use decision that may be accompanied by mandatory remedial actions and compensating controls. Second, these decisions are reviewed, challenged, and confirmed by the MRC. Finally, model use decisions, risk ratings, and overall levels of model risk are reported to and reviewed by MRAC.  MRM also reports regularly on model risk issues to the Board. Strategic Risk Management We define strategic risk as the current or prospective impact on earnings or capital arising from adverse business decisions, improper implementation of strategic initiatives, or lack of responsiveness to industry-wide changes. Strategic risks are influenced by changes in the competitive environment; decline in market performance or changes in our business activities; and the potential secondary impacts of reputational risks, not already captured as market, interest rate, credit, operational, model or liquidity risks.  We incorporate strategic risk into our assessment of our business plans and risk and capital management processes.  Active management of strategic risk is an integral component of all aspects of our business. Separating the effects of a potential material adverse event into operational and strategic risk is sometimes difficult.  For instance, the direct financial impact of an unfavorable event in the form of fines or penalties would be classified as an operational risk loss, while the impact on our reputation and consequently the potential loss of clients and corresponding decline in revenue would be classified as a strategic risk loss.  An additional example of strategic risk is the integration of a major acquisition.  Failure to successfully integrate the operations of an acquired business, and the resultant inability to retain clients and the associated revenue, would be classified as a loss due to strategic risk. Strategic risk is managed with a long-term focus.  Techniques for its assessment and management include the development of business plans, which are subject to robust review and challenge from senior management and the Board of Directors, as well as a formal review and approval process for all new business and product proposals.  The potential impact of the various elements of strategic risk is difficult to quantify with any degree of precision.  We use a combination of historical earnings volatility, scenario analysis, stress-testing and management judgment to help assess the potential effect on State Street attributable to strategic risk.  Management and control of strategic risks are generally the responsibility of the business units, with oversight from the control functions, as part of their overall strategic planning and internal risk management processes. Capital Managing our capital involves evaluating whether our actual and projected levels of capital are commensurate with our risk profile, are in compliance with all applicable regulatory requirements, and are sufficient to provide us with the financial flexibility to undertake future strategic business initiatives.  We assess capital adequacy based on relevant regulatory capital requirements, as well as our own internal capital goals, targets and other relevant metrics. Framework Our objective with respect to management of our capital is to maintain a strong capital base in order to provide financial flexibility for our business needs, including funding corporate growth and supporting clients' cash management needs, and to provide protection against loss to depositors and creditors.  We strive to maintain an appropriate level of capital, commensurate with our risk profile, on which an attractive return to shareholders is expected to be realized over both the short and long term, while protecting our obligations to depositors and creditors and complying with regulatory capital requirements. Our capital management focuses on our risk exposures, the regulatory requirements applicable to us with respect to multiple capital measures, the State Street Corporation | 102 Table of Contents MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS evaluations and resulting credit ratings of the major independent rating agencies, our return on capital at both the consolidated and line-of-business level, and our capital position relative to our peers. Assessment of our overall capital adequacy includes the comparison of capital sources with capital uses, as well as the consideration of the quality and quantity of the various components of capital.  The assessment seeks to determine the optimal level of capital and composition of capital instruments to satisfy all constituents of capital, with the lowest overall cost to shareholders.  Other factors considered in our assessment of capital adequacy are strategic and contingency planning, stress testing and planned capital actions. Capital Adequacy Process Our primary federal banking regulator is the Federal Reserve.  Both State Street and State Street Bank are subject to the minimum regulatory capital requirements established by the Federal Reserve and defined in FDICIA.  State Street Bank must exceed the regulatory capital thresholds for ""well capitalized"" in order for our Parent Company to maintain its status as a financial holding company.  Accordingly, one of our primary goals with respect to capital management is to exceed all applicable minimum regulatory capital requirements and to be ""well-capitalized"" under the PCA guidelines established by the FDIC.  Our capital management activities are conducted as part of our corporate-wide CAP and associated Capital Policy and guidelines. We consider capital adequacy to be a key element of our financial well-being, which affects our ability to attract and maintain client relationships; operate effectively in the global capital markets; and satisfy regulatory, security holder and shareholder needs.  Capital is one of several elements that affect our credit ratings and the ratings of our principal subsidiaries. In conformity with our Capital Policy and guidelines, we strive to achieve and maintain specific internal capital levels, not just at a point in time, but over time and during periods of stress, to account for changes in our strategic direction, evolving economic conditions, and financial and market volatility.  We have developed and implemented a corporate-wide CAP to assess our overall capital in relation to our risk profile and to provide a comprehensive strategy for maintaining appropriate capital levels.  The CAP considers material risks under multiple scenarios, with an emphasis on stress scenarios, and encompasses existing processes and systems used to measure our capital adequacy. Capital Contingency Planning Contingency planning is an integral component of capital management.  The objective of contingency planning is to monitor current and forecast levels of select capital, liquidity and other measures that serve as early indicators of a potentially adverse capital or liquidity adequacy situation.  These measures are one of the inputs used to set our internal capital adequacy level.  We review these measures annually for appropriateness and relevance in relation to our financial budget and capital plan. Stress Testing We administer a robust State Street-wide stress-testing program that executes multiple stress tests each year to assess the institution's capital adequacy and/or future performance under adverse conditions. Our stress testing program is structured around what we determine to be the key risks incurred by State Street, as assessed through a recurring material risk identification process. The material risk identification process represents a bottom-up approach to identifying the institution's most significant risk exposures across all on- and off-balance sheet risk-taking activities, including credit, market, liquidity, interest rate, operational, fiduciary, business, reputation, and regulatory risks. These key risks serve as an organizing principle for much of our risk management framework, as well as reporting, including the ""risk dashboard"" provided to the Board. Over the past few years, stress scenarios have included a deep recession in the U.S., a break-up of the Eurozone, a severe recession in China and an oil shock precipitated by turmoil in the Middle East/North Africa region. In connection with the focus on our key risks, each stress test incorporates idiosyncratic loss events tailored to State Street's unique risk profile and business activities.  Due to the nature of our business model and our consolidated statement of condition, our risks differ from those of a traditional commercial bank. The Federal Reserve requires bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of $50 billion or more, which includes State Street, to submit a capital plan on an annual basis. The Federal Reserve uses its annual CCAR process, which incorporates hypothetical financial and economic stress scenarios, to review those capital plans and assess whether banking organizations have capital planning processes that account for idiosyncratic risks and provide for sufficient capital to continue operations throughout times of economic and financial stress. As part of its CCAR process, the Federal Reserve assesses each organization's capital adequacy, capital planning process, and plans to distribute capital, such as dividend payments or stock purchase programs. Management and Board risk committees review, challenge, and approve CCAR results and assumptions before submission to State Street Corporation | 103 Table of Contents MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS the Federal Reserve. Through the evaluation of State Street's capital adequacy and/or future performance under adverse conditions, the stress testing processes provide important insights for capital planning, risk management, and strategic decision-making at State Street. Governance In order to support integrated decision making, we have identified three management elements to aid in the compatibility and coordination of our CAP:  Risk Management - identification, measurement, monitoring and forecasting of different types of risk and their combined impact on capital adequacy;  Capital Management - determination of optimal capital levels; and  Business Management - strategic planning, budgeting, forecasting, and performance management. We have a hierarchical structure supporting appropriate committee review of relevant risk and capital information.  The ongoing responsibility for capital management rests with our Treasurer.  The Capital Planning group within Global Treasury is responsible for the Capital Policy and guidelines, development of the Capital Plan, the management of global capital, capital optimization, and business unit capital management. MRAC provides oversight of our capital management, our capital adequacy, our internal targets and the expectations of the major independent credit rating agencies.  In addition, MRAC approves our balance sheet strategy and related activities.  The Board's RC assists the Board in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities related to the assessment and management of risk and capital. Our Capital Policy is reviewed and approved annually by the Board's RC. Global Systemically Important Bank We are one among a group of 30 institutions worldwide that have been identified by the FSB and the BCBS as G-SIBs.  Our designation as a G-SIB requires us to maintain an additional capital buffer above the Basel III final rule minimum CET1 capital ratio of 4.5%, based on a number of factors, as evaluated by banking regulators. We and our depository institution subsidiaries are subject to the current Basel III minimum risk-based capital and leverage ratio guidelines.  The Basel III final rule incorporates several multi-year transition provisions for capital components and minimum ratio requirements for CET1 capital, tier 1 capital and total capital. Additional information about G-SIBs is provided under ""Regulatory Capital Adequacy and Liquidity Standards"" in ""Supervision and Regulation"" under Item 1, Business, of this Form 10-K. Regulatory Capital We and State Street Bank, as advanced approaches banking organizations, are subject to the current Basel III minimum risk-based capital and leverage ratio guidelines.  The Basel III final rule incorporates several multi-year transition provisions for capital components and minimum ratio requirements for CET1 capital, tier 1 capital and total capital.  The transition period started in January 2014 and will be completed by January 1, 2019, which is concurrent with the full implementation of the Basel III final rule in the U.S. Among other things, the Basel III final rule introduced a minimum CET1 risk-based capital ratio of 4.5% and raises the minimum tier 1 risk-based capital ratio from 4% to 6%.  In addition, for advanced approaches banking organizations such as State Street, the Basel III final rule imposes a minimum supplementary tier 1 leverage ratio of 3%, the numerator of which is tier 1 capital and the denominator of which includes both on-balance sheet assets and certain off-balance sheet exposures. The Basel III final rule also introduced a capital conservation buffer and a countercyclical capital buffer that add to the minimum risk-based capital ratios.  Specifically, the final rule limits a banking organization's ability to make capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments to executive officers if it fails to maintain a CET1 capital conservation buffer of more than 2.5% of total risk-weighted assets and, if deployed during periods of excessive credit growth, a CET1 countercyclical capital buffer of up to 2.5% of total risk-weighted assets, above each of the minimum CET1, and tier 1 and total risk-based capital ratios.  The countercyclical capital buffer is currently set at zero by U.S. banking regulators. To maintain the status of our Parent Company as a financial holding company, we and our insured depository institution subsidiaries are required to be ""well-capitalized"" by maintaining capital ratios above the minimum requirements.  Effective on January 1, 2015, the ""well-capitalized"" standard for our banking subsidiaries was revised to reflect the higher capital requirements in the Basel III final rule. In addition to introducing new capital ratios and buffers, the Basel III final rule revises the eligibility criteria for regulatory capital instruments and provides for the phase-out of existing capital instruments that do not satisfy the new criteria.  For example, existing trust preferred capital securities were phased out from tier 1 capital over a two-year period that ended on January 1, 2016, and subsequently, the State Street Corporation | 104 Table of Contents MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS qualification of these securities as tier 2 capital will be phased out over a multi-year transition period beginning on January 1, 2016 and ending on January 1, 2022.  As of December 31, 2016, we retired the trusts related to our trust preferred securities and the underlying indentures do not qualify as tier 2 regulatory capital. Under the Basel III final rule, certain new items are deducted from CET1 capital and certain regulatory capital deductions were modified as compared to the previously applicable capital regulations.  Among other things, the final rule requires significant investments in the common stock of unconsolidated financial institutions, as defined, and certain deferred tax assets that exceed specified individual and aggregate thresholds to be deducted from CET1 capital.  As an advanced approaches banking organization, after-tax unrealized gains and losses on AFS investment securities flow through to and affect State Street's and State Street Bank's CET1 capital, subject to a phase-in schedule. We are required to use the advanced approaches framework as provided in the Basel III final rule to determine our risk-based capital requirements.  The Dodd-Frank Act applies a ""capital floor"" to advanced approaches banking organizations, such as State Street and State Street Bank.  We are subject to the more stringent of the risk-based capital ratios calculated under the standardized approach and those calculated under the advanced approaches in the assessment of our capital adequacy under the PCA framework. The following table sets forth the transition to full implementation and the minimum risk-based capital ratio requirements under the Basel III final rule.

(2)  As part of the G-SIB Surcharge final rule, the Federal Reserve published estimated G-SIB surcharges for the eight U.S. G-SIBs based on relevant data from 2012-2014 and the estimated resulting G-SIB surcharge for State Street is 1.5%. Including the 1.5% surcharge, State Street's minimum risk-based capital ratio requirements, as of January 1, 2019 would be 8.5% for CET1, 10.0% for tier 1 capital and 12.0% for total capital. (3) Minimum CET1 capital, minimum tier 1 capital and minimum total capital presented include the transitional capital conservation buffer as well as the estimated transitional G-SIB surcharge being phased-in beginning January 1, 2016 through January 1, 2019 based on an estimated 1.5% surcharge in all periods. The specific calculation of State Street's and State Street Bank's risk-based capital ratios will change as the provisions of the Basel III final rule related to the numerator (capital) and denominator (risk-weighted assets) are phased in, and as our risk-weighted assets calculated using the advanced approaches change due to potential changes in methodology.  These ongoing methodological changes will result in differences in our reported capital ratios from one reporting period to the next that are independent of applicable changes to our capital base, our asset composition, our off-balance sheet exposures or our risk profile. The following table presents the regulatory capital structure and related regulatory capital ratios for State Street and State Street Bank as of the dates indicated.  We are subject to the more stringent of the risk-based capital ratios calculated under the standardized approach and those calculated under the advanced approaches in the assessment of our capital adequacy under applicable bank regulatory standards. As a result of changes in the methodologies used to calculate our regulatory capital ratios from period to period, as the provisions of the Basel III final rule are phased in, the ratios presented in the table for each period are not directly comparable.

Tier 1 leverage ratio as of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 were calculated in conformity with the Basel III final rule. (2)   CET1 capital, tier 1 capital and total capital ratios as of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 were calculated in conformity with the standardized approach provisions of the Basel III final rule.  Tier 1 leverage ratio as of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 were calculated in conformity with the Basel III final rule. (3)   Amounts for State Street and State Street Bank as of December 31, 2017 consisted of goodwill, net of associated deferred tax liabilities, and 80% of other intangible assets, net of associated deferred tax liabilities. Amounts for State Street and State Street Bank as of December 31, 2016 consisted of goodwill, net of deferred tax liabilities and 60% of other intangible assets, net of associated deferred tax liabilities.  Intangible assets, net of associated deferred tax liabilities is phased in as a deduction from capital, in conformity with the Basel III final rule. (4)   Under the current advanced approaches rules and regulatory guidance concerning operational risk models, RWA attributable to operational risk can vary substantially from period-to-period, without direct correlation to the effects of a particular loss event on our results of operations and financial condition and impacting dates and periods that may differ from the dates and periods as of and during which the loss event is reflected in our financial statements, with the timing and categorization dependent on the processes for model updates and, if applicable, model revalidation and regulatory review and related supervisory processes.  An individual loss event can have a significant effect on the output of our operational risk RWA under the advanced approaches depending on the severity of the loss event and its categorization among the seven Basel-defined UOMs. (5)   Market risk risk-weighted assets reported in conformity with the Basel III advanced approaches included a CVA which reflected the risk of potential fair value adjustments for credit risk reflected in our valuation of over-the-counter derivative contracts.  The CVA was not provided for in the final market risk capital rule; however, it was required by the advanced approaches provisions of the Basel III final rule.  We used a simple CVA approach in conformity with the Basel III advanced approaches. (6)    Minimum requirements will be phased in up to full implementation beginning on January 1, 2019; minimum requirements listed are as of December 31, 2017. See Table 36: Basel III Final Rules Transition Arrangements and Minimum Risk Based Capital Ratios.

NA Not applicable State Street Corporation | 106 Table of Contents MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS As of January 1, 2015, we used the standardized provisions of the Basel III final rule in addition to the advanced approaches provisions which were previously implemented in the second quarter of 2014, and the lower of our regulatory capital ratios calculated under the advanced approaches and those ratios calculated under the standardized approach are applied in the assessment of our capital adequacy for regulatory capital purposes.  Beginning in the second quarter of 2014, until January 1, 2015, we used the advanced approaches provisions in the Basel III final rule, and transitional provisions of the Basel III final rule, and the lower of our regulatory capital ratios calculated under the advanced approaches and those ratios calculated under the transitional provisions were applied in the assessment of our capital adequacy for regulatory capital purposes. Our CET1 capital increased $580 million as of December 31, 2017 compared to December 31, 2016 primarily due to net income of $2.18 billion and an increase in accumulated other comprehensive income of $964 million.  The increases in CET1 capital were partially offset by capital distributions of $2.23 billion from common stock purchases and dividends, the impact from the 2017 phase-in of the deduction of intangibles (80% in 2017 compared to 60% in 2016), and the impact from the TCJA in 2017.  The TCJA resulted in one-time estimated net impact to capital attributable to a change in deferred tax liability on capital deductions of $356 million which consisted of the $270 million impact to net income and an additional $86 million related to a net change in deductible deferred taxes.  Actual effects of the TCJA may differ from these estimates, among other things, due to additional tax and regulatory guidance and change in State Street assumptions and interpretations. In the same comparative period, our tier 1 capital increased $665 million, due to the increase in CET1 capital. Total capital increased $458 million under advanced approaches and increased $468 million under standardized approach due to the changes to tier 1 capital. State Street Bank's tier 1 capital increased $726 million, and total capital increased $515 million and $525 million under the advanced and standardized approaches, respectively, as of December 31, 2017, compared to December 31, 2016. The increase is a result of higher CET1. The table below presents a roll-forward of CET1 capital, tier 1 capital and total capital for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.

As of December 31, 2017, total advanced approaches risk-weighted assets decreased $145 million compared to December 31, 2016, mainly due to a decrease in credit risk and market risk, partially offset by an increase in operational risk.  The decrease in credit risk was mainly due to lower volatility in our FX derivative portfolio leading to a lower positive marked-to-market, a decrease in cash and redemptions of equity investments, offset by an increase in the investment portfolio driven by purchases of foreign sovereign bonds.  Market risk reduction of $417 million resulted from a lower stressed VaR.  The decrease in credit valuation adjustment was also driven by the lower marked-to-market in our FX derivative portfolios.  Operational risk increased approximately $1.24 billion due to a recalibration of the Operational Risk Advanced Measurement Approach Capital model. As of December 31, 2016, total advanced approaches risk-weighted assets decreased $251 million compared to December 31, 2015, mainly due to a decrease in credit risk and market risk, partially offset by an increase in operational risk and credit valuation adjustment.  The decrease in credit risk was mainly due to a decrease in securitization exposures as a result of sell-offs and maturities as well as calls of agency debt securities within our wholesale investment portfolio, partially offset by an increase in derivatives exposure from marked-to-market FX contracts stemming from a stronger dollar and an increase in securities finance agency lending.  The market risk decrease was a result of reduced end of day positions in FX and interest rate risk.  Operational risk increased approximately $700 million mainly due to an increase in loss event frequency.  The increase in credit valuation adjustment was driven by an increase in the market valuation FX contracts. The following table presents a roll-forward of the Basel III standardized approach risk-weighted assets for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.

(2)  Includes assets not in a definable category, cleared transactions, other wholesale, cash and due from, and interest-bearing deposits with banks and equity exposures. As of December 31, 2017, total standardized approach risk-weighted assets increased $2.81 billion compared to December 31, 2016, primarily the result of an increase in credit risk partially offset by a decrease in market risk resulting from a lower stressed VaR.  The main drivers of the credit risk change were an increase in loans, securities finance portfolio due to a mix shift to equities, corporate bonds and sovereigns, and an increase in the investment portfolio due to purchases, offset by a decrease in FX contracts due to a shift to counterparties with a lower weighted-average risk-weight. State Street Corporation | 108 Table of Contents MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS As of December 31, 2016, total standardized approach risk-weighted assets increased $3.98 billion compared to December 31, 2015, primarily the result of an increase in securities finance agency lending, an increase in market values of FX contracts, partially offset by a decrease in securitization exposures, wholesale investments and market risk.  The decrease in securitization was due to sell-offs and maturities while the decrease in wholesale investments was due to calls of agency debt securities.  Market risk reduction resulted from a lower stressed VaR. The regulatory capital ratios as of December 31, 2017, presented in Table 41: Regulatory Capital Structure and Related Regulatory Capital Ratios, are calculated under the standardized approach and advanced approaches in conformity with the Basel III final rule.  The advanced approaches-based ratios (actual and estimated pro forma) reflect calculations and determinations with respect to our capital and related matters as of December 31, 2017, based on State Street and external data, quantitative formulae, statistical models, historical correlations and assumptions, collectively referred to as ""advanced systems,"" in effect and used by State Street for those purposes as of the time we first reported such ratios in a quarterly report on the Form 10-Q or an annual report on Form 10-K.  Significant components of these advanced systems involve the exercise of judgment by us and our regulators, and our advanced systems may not, individually or collectively, precisely represent or calculate the scenarios, circumstances, outputs or other results for which they are designed or intended. Our advanced systems are subject to update and periodic revalidation in response to changes in our business activities and our historical experiences, forces and events experienced by the market broadly or by individual financial institutions, changes in regulations and regulatory interpretations and other factors, and are also subject to continuing regulatory review and approval.  For example, a significant operational loss experienced by another financial institution, even if we do not experience a related loss, could result in a material change in the output of our advanced systems and a corresponding material change in our risk exposures, our total risk-weighted assets and our capital ratios compared to prior periods.  An operational loss that we experience could also result in a material change in our capital requirements for operational risk under the advanced approaches, depending on the severity of the loss event, its characterization among the seven Basel-defined UOMs, and the stability of the distributional approach for a particular UOM, and without direct correlation to the effects of the loss event, or the timing of such effects, on our results of operations. Due to the influence of changes in these advanced systems, whether resulting from changes in data inputs, regulation or regulatory supervision or interpretation, State Street-specific or market activities or experiences or other updates or factors, we expect that our advanced systems and our capital ratios calculated in conformity with the Basel III final rule will change and may be volatile over time, and that those latter changes or volatility could be material as calculated and measured from period to period.  Models implemented under the Basel III final rule, particularly those implementing the advanced approaches, remain subject to regulatory review and approval.  The full effects of the Basel III final rule on State Street and State Street Bank are therefore subject to further evaluation and also to further regulatory guidance, action or rule-making.

State Street Corporation | 111 Table of Contents MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Supplementary Leverage Ratio In 2014, U.S. banking regulators issued final rules implementing an SLR, for certain bank holding companies, like State Street, and their insured depository institution subsidiaries, like State Street Bank, which we refer to as the SLR final rule.  Upon implementation, the SLR final rule requires that, as of January 1, 2018, (i) State Street Bank maintain an SLR of at least 6% to be well capitalized under the U.S. banking regulators' PCA framework and (ii) State Street maintain an SLR of at least 5% to avoid limitations on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments.  In addition to the SLR, State Street is subject to a minimum tier 1 leverage ratio of 4%, which differs from the SLR primarily in that the denominator of the tier 1 leverage ratio is only a quarterly average of on-balance sheet assets and does not include any off-balance sheet exposures.  Beginning with reporting for March 31, 2015, State Street was required to include SLR disclosures, calculated on a transitional basis, with its other Basel disclosures.

In addition, banking regulators have the authority to prohibit bank holding companies from paying dividends. For information concerning limitations on dividends from our subsidiary banks, refer to ""Related Stockholder Matters"" included under Item 5, Market for Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities, and to Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements included under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Form 10-K.  Our common stock and preferred stock dividends, including the declaration, timing and amount thereof, are subject to consideration and approval by the Board at the relevant times. Stock purchases may be made using various types of mechanisms, including open market purchases, accelerated share repurchases or transactions off market, and may be made under Rule 10b5-1 trading programs.  The timing of stock purchases, types of transactions and number of shares purchased will depend on several factors, including, market conditions and State Street's capital positions, its financial performance and investment opportunities.  The common stock purchase program does not have specific price targets and may be suspended at any time. OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS On behalf of clients enrolled in our securities lending program, we lend securities to banks, broker/dealers and other institutions.  In most circumstances, we indemnify our clients for the fair market value of those securities against a failure of the borrower to return such securities.  Though these transactions are collateralized, the substantial volume of these activities necessitates detailed credit-based underwriting and monitoring processes.  The aggregate amount of indemnified securities on loan totaled $381.82 billion as of December 31, 2017, compared to $360.45 billion as of December 31, 2016.  We require the borrower to provide collateral in an amount in excess of 100% of the fair market value of the securities borrowed.  We hold the collateral received in connection with these securities lending services as agent, and the collateral is not recorded in our consolidated statement of condition.  We revalue the securities on loan and the collateral daily to determine if additional collateral is necessary or if excess collateral is required to be returned to the borrower.  We held, as agent, cash and securities totaling $400.83 billion and $377.92 billion as collateral for indemnified securities on loan as of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively. The cash collateral held by us as agent is invested on behalf of our clients.  In certain cases, the cash collateral is invested in third-party repurchase agreements, for which we indemnify the client against loss of the principal invested. We require the counterparty to the indemnified repurchase agreement to provide collateral in an amount in excess of 100% of the amount of the repurchase agreement. In our role as agent, the indemnified repurchase agreements and the related collateral held by us are not recorded in our consolidated statement of condition. Of the collateral of $400.83 State Street Corporation | 114 Table of Contents MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS billion and $377.92 billion, referenced above, $61.27 billion and $60.00 billion was invested in indemnified repurchase agreements as of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively. We or our agents held $65.27 billion and $63.96 billion as collateral for indemnified investments in repurchase agreements as of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively. Additional information about our securities finance activities and other off-balance sheet arrangements is provided in Notes 10, 12 and 14 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP, and we apply accounting policies that affect the determination of amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements.  Additional information on our significant accounting policies, including references to applicable footnotes, is provided in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Form 10-K. Certain of our accounting policies, by their nature, require management to make judgments, involving significant estimates and assumptions, about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates and assumptions are based on information available as of the date of the consolidated financial statements, and changes in this information over time could materially affect the amounts of assets, liabilities, equity, revenue and expenses reported in subsequent consolidated financial statements. Based on the sensitivity of reported financial statement amounts to the underlying estimates and assumptions, the more significant accounting policies applied by State Street have been identified by management as those associated with recurring fair value measurements, OTTI of investment securities, impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets, and contingencies. These accounting policies require the most subjective or complex judgments, and underlying estimates and assumptions could be most subject to revision as new information becomes available.  An understanding of the judgments, estimates and assumptions underlying these accounting policies is essential in order to understand our reported consolidated results of operations and financial condition. The following is a discussion of the above-mentioned significant accounting estimates. Management has discussed these significant accounting estimates with the E&A Committee of the Board. Fair Value Measurements We carry certain of our financial assets and liabilities at fair value in our consolidated financial statements on a recurring basis, including trading account assets, AFS investment securities and derivative instruments. Changes in the fair value of these financial assets and liabilities are recorded either as components of our consolidated statement of income, or as components of other comprehensive income within shareholders' equity in our consolidated statement of condition. In addition to those financial assets and liabilities that we carry at fair value in our consolidated financial statements on a recurring basis, we estimate the fair values of other financial assets and liabilities that we carry at amortized cost in our consolidated statement of condition, and we disclose these fair value estimates in the notes to our consolidated financial statements. We estimate the fair values of these financial assets and liabilities using the definition of fair value described below. Additional information with respect to the assets and liabilities carried by us at fair value on a recurring basis is provided in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Form 10-K. U.S. GAAP defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market for an asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. When we measure fair value for our financial assets and liabilities, we consider the principal or the most advantageous market in which we would transact; we also consider assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability. When possible, we look to active and observable markets to measure the fair value of identical, or similar, financial assets and liabilities. When identical financial assets and liabilities are not traded in active markets, we look to market-observable data for similar assets and liabilities. In some instances, certain assets and liabilities are not actively traded in observable markets; as a result, we use alternate valuation techniques to measure their fair value. We categorize the financial assets and liabilities that we carry at fair value in our consolidated statement of condition on a recurring basis based on U.S. GAAP's prescribed three-level valuation hierarchy. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (level 1) and the lowest priority to valuation methods using significant unobservable inputs (level 3). State Street Corporation | 115 Table of Contents MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS As of December 31, 2017, including the effect of netting, we categorized approximately 1% of our financial assets carried at fair value in level 1, approximately 96% of our financial assets carried at fair value in level 2, and approximately 3% of our financial assets carried at fair value in level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.  As of December 31, 2016, including the effect of netting, we categorized approximately 6% of our financial assets carried at fair value in level 1, approximately 92% of our financial assets carried at fair value in level 2, and approximately 2% of our financial assets carried at fair value in level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. As of December 31, 2017, on the same basis, we categorized less than 1% of our financial liabilities carried at fair value in level 1, approximately 99% of our financial liabilities carried at fair value in level 2, and less than 1% of our financial liabilities carried at fair value in level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.  As of December 31, 2016, on the same basis, we categorized none of our financial liabilities carried at fair value in level 1, approximately 100% of our financial liabilities carried at fair value in level 2, and less than 1% of our financial liabilities carried at fair value in level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. The assets categorized in level 1 were primarily U.S. Treasury obligations and trading account assets.  Fair value for these securities was measured by management using unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical securities. The assets categorized in level 2 were primarily AFS investment securities and derivative instruments.  Fair value for the investment securities was measured by management primarily using information obtained from independent third parties. Information obtained from third parties is subject to review by management as part of a validation process. Management utilizes a process to verify the information provided, including an understanding of underlying assumptions and the level of market-participant information used to support those assumptions. In addition, management compares significant assumptions used by third parties to available market information. Such information may include known trades or, to the extent that trading activity is limited, comparisons to market research information pertaining to credit expectations, execution prices and the timing of cash flows and, where information is available, back-testing. The derivative instruments categorized in level 2 primarily comprised of foreign exchange and interest-rate contracts used in our trading activities, for which fair value was measured by management using discounted cash flow techniques, with inputs consisting of observable spot and forward points, as well as observable interest rate curves. The substantial majority of our financial assets categorized in level 3 were asset-backed AFS securities. Level-3 assets also included foreign exchange derivative contracts. The aggregate fair value of our financial assets and liabilities categorized in level 3 as of December 31, 2017 increased approximately 57% compared to 2016, primarily the result of purchases of asset-backed and non-U.S. debt securities. With respect to derivative instruments, we evaluated the impact on valuation of the credit risk of our counterparties and of our own credit. We considered such factors as the market-based probability of default by us and our counterparties, and our current and expected potential future net exposures by remaining maturities, in determining the appropriate measurements of fair value.  Valuation adjustments associated with derivative instruments were not significant to our consolidated financial results in 2017, 2016 or 2015. Other-Than-Temporary Impairment of Investment Securities Our portfolio of fixed-income investment securities constitutes a significant portion of the assets carried in our consolidated statement of condition.  U.S. GAAP requires the use of expected future cash flows to evaluate OTTI of these investment securities.  The amount and timing of these expected future cash flows are significant estimates used in our evaluation of OTTI.  An OTTI is triggered if the intent is to sell the security or the security will more likely than not have to be sold before the amortized cost basis is recovered.  Additional information with respect to management's assessment of OTTI is provided in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included under Item 8, Financial Statements, of this Form 10-K. Expectations of defaults and prepayments are the most significant assumptions underlying our estimates of future cash flows. In determining these estimates, management relies on relevant and reliable information, including but not limited to deal structure, including optional and mandatory calls, market interest-rate curves, industry standard asset-class-specific prepayment models, recent prepayment history, independent credit ratings, and recent actual and projected credit losses. Management considers this information based on its relevance and uses its best judgment in order to determine its assumptions for underlying cash-flow expectations and resulting estimates. Management reviews its underlying assumptions and develops expected future cash-flow estimates at least quarterly. Additional detail with respect to the sensitivity of these default and prepayment assumptions is provided under ""Investment Securities"" in ""Financial State Street Corporation | 116 Table of Contents MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Condition"" of this Management's Discussion and Analysis. Impairment of Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the net tangible and other intangible assets acquired at the acquisition date. Other intangible assets represent purchased long-lived intangible assets, primarily client relationships and core deposit intangible assets, that can be distinguished from goodwill because of contractual rights or because the asset can be exchanged on its own or in combination with a related contract, asset or liability.  Goodwill is not amortized, while other intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives. Goodwill is ultimately supported by earnings and cash flows from our Investment Servicing and Investment Management lines of business.  A decline in earnings as a result of a lack of growth, or our inability to deliver cost-effective services over sustained periods, could lead to a perceived impairment of goodwill, which would be evaluated and, if necessary, be recorded as a write-down of the reported amount of goodwill through a charge to other expenses in our consolidated statement of income. Management reviews goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently if circumstances arise or events occur that indicate an impairment of the carrying amount may exist. We begin our review by first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If we conclude from the qualitative assessment of goodwill impairment that it is more likely than not that a reporting unit's fair value is greater than its carrying amount, quantitative tests are not required. However, if we determine it is more likely than not that a reporting unit's fair value is less than its carrying amount, then we complete a quantitative assessment to determine if there is goodwill impairment. The quantitative assessment involves using a two-step process. First, we compare the aggregate fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the fair value exceeds the carrying amount, no impairment exists. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value, then we compare the ""implied"" fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill to its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of the goodwill exceeds the implied fair value, then goodwill impairment is recognized by writing the goodwill down to the implied fair value. The implied fair value of the goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit, as if the unit had been acquired in a business combination and the overall fair value of the unit was the purchase price. To determine the aggregate fair value of the reporting unit being evaluated for goodwill impairment, we use one of two principal methodologies: a market approach, based on a comparison of the reporting unit to publicly-traded companies in similar lines of business; or an income approach, based on the value of the cash flows that the business can be expected to generate in the future. Events that may indicate impairment include significant or adverse changes in the business, economic or political climate; an adverse action or assessment by a regulator; unanticipated competition; and a more-likely-than-not expectation that we will sell or otherwise dispose of a business to which the goodwill or other intangible assets relate.  Additional information about goodwill and other intangible assets, including information by line of business, is provided in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements included under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary, of this Form 10-K. During the third quarter of 2017, we assessed goodwill for impairment using a qualitative assessment. The qualitative assessment required management to make judgments and to evaluate several factors, which included, but were not limited to, significant or adverse changes in the business, firm and industry events, economic or political climate; an adverse action or assessment by a regulator; unanticipated competition; and a more-likely-than-not expectation that we will sell or otherwise dispose of a business to which the goodwill or other intangible assets relate. Based on our evaluation of these factors, we determined that it was more likely than not that the fair value of each of the reporting units exceeded its respective carrying amount. Additional information about goodwill and other intangible assets, including information by line of business, is provided in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements included under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Form 10-K. Intangible assets are supported by the future cash flows that are directly associated with and expected to arise as a direct result of the use of the intangible asset, less any costs associated with the intangible asset's eventual disposition. We evaluate other intangible assets for impairment at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows from other groups of assets using a two-step process.  First, if the intangible asset's estimated future net undiscounted cash flows are greater than the carrying State Street Corporation | 117 Table of Contents MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS value, there is no indication of impairment, but if the intangible asset's net undiscounted cash flows are less than its carrying value, there is an indication that the intangible asset is not recoverable and we proceed to the second step of the impairment test.  In the second step, if the fair value of the intangible asset is below the carrying value, an impairment is recognized by writing the intangible asset down to its fair value.  We evaluate intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if circumstances arise that may indicate an impairment of the carrying amount. Our evaluation of goodwill and other intangible assets indicated that no significant impairment occurred in 2017, 2016 or 2015.  Goodwill and other intangible assets recorded in our consolidated statement of condition as of December 31, 2017 totaled approximately $6.02 billion and $1.61 billion, respectively, compared to $5.81 billion and $1.75 billion, respectively, as of December 31, 2016.

State Street Corporation | 119 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm The Shareholders and Board of Directors of State Street Corporation Opinion on the Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying consolidated statements of condition of State Street Corporation (the ""Corporation"") as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in shareholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2017, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the ""consolidated financial statements"").  In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Corporation at December 31, 2017 and 2016, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2017, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (""PCAOB""), the Corporation's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated February 26, 2018 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. Basis for Opinion These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Corporation's management.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Corporation's consolidated financial statements based on our audits.  We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Corporation in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud.  Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks.  Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.

State Street Corporation | 126 Table of Contents STATE STREET CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Note 1.    Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Basis of Presentation The accounting and financial reporting policies of State Street Corporation conform to U.S. GAAP.  State Street Corporation, the Parent Company, is a financial holding company headquartered in Boston, Massachusetts.  Unless otherwise indicated or unless the context requires otherwise, all references in these notes to consolidated financial statements to ""State Street,"" ""we,"" ""us,"" ""our"" or similar references mean State Street Corporation and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis, including our principal banking subsidiary, State Street Bank. We have two lines of business: Investment Servicing provides products and services including: custody; product and participant level accounting; daily pricing and administration; master trust and master custody; depotbank services (a fund oversight role created by regulation); record-keeping; cash management; foreign exchange, brokerage and other trading services; securities finance; our enhanced custody product, which integrates principal securities lending and custody; deposit and short-term investment facilities; loans and lease financing; investment manager and alternative investment manager operations outsourcing; performance, risk and compliance analytics; and financial data management to support institutional investors. Investment Management, through SSGA, provides a broad array of investment management, investment research and investment advisory services to corporations, public funds and other sophisticated investors.  SSGA offers passive and active asset management strategies across equity, fixed-income, alternative, multi-asset solutions (including OCIO) and cash asset classes.  Products are distributed directly and through intermediaries using a variety of investment vehicles, including ETFs, such as the SPDR® ETF brand. Consolidation Our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Parent Company and its majority- and wholly-owned and otherwise controlled subsidiaries, including State Street Bank.  All material inter-company transactions and balances have been eliminated.  Certain previously reported amounts have been reclassified to conform to current-year presentation. We consolidate subsidiaries in which we exercise control. Investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries, recorded in other assets, generally are accounted for under the equity method of accounting if we have the ability to exercise significant influence over the operations of the investee.  For investments accounted for under the equity method, our share of income or loss is recorded in processing fees and other revenue in our consolidated statement of income.  Investments not meeting the criteria for equity-method treatment are accounted for under the cost method of accounting. Use of Estimates The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions in the application of certain of our significant accounting policies that may materially affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, equity, revenue, and expenses.  As a result of unanticipated events or circumstances, actual results could differ from those estimates. Foreign Currency Translation The assets and liabilities of our operations with functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar are translated at month-end exchange rates, and revenue and expenses are translated at rates that approximate average monthly exchange rates.  Gains or losses from the translation of the net assets of subsidiaries with functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar, net of related taxes, are recorded in AOCI, a component of shareholders' equity. Cash and Cash Equivalents For purposes of the consolidated statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents are defined as cash and due from banks. Interest-Bearing Deposits with Banks Interest-bearing deposits with banks generally consist of highly liquid, short-term investments maintained at the Federal Reserve Bank and other non-U.S. central banks with original maturities at the time of purchase of one month or less. Securities Purchased Under Resale Agreements and Securities Sold Under Repurchase Agreements Securities purchased under resale agreements and sold under repurchase agreements are treated as collateralized financing transactions, and are recorded in our consolidated statement of condition at the amounts at which the securities will be subsequently resold or repurchased, plus accrued interest.  Our policy is to take possession or control of securities underlying resale agreements either directly or through agent banks, allowing borrowers the right of collateral substitution and/or short-notice termination.  We revalue these securities daily to determine if additional collateral is necessary from the borrower to protect us against credit exposure.  We can use these securities as collateral for repurchase agreements. State Street Corporation | 127 Table of Contents STATE STREET CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS For securities sold under repurchase agreements collateralized by our investment securities portfolio, the dollar value of the securities remains in investment securities in our consolidated statement of condition.  Where a master netting agreement exists or both parties are members of a common clearing organization, resale and repurchase agreements with the same counterparty or clearing house and maturity date are recorded on a net basis. Fee and Net Interest Income Fees from investment servicing, investment management, securities finance, trading services and certain types of processing fees and other revenue are recorded in our consolidated statement of income based on estimates or specific contractual terms, including mutually agreed changes to terms, as transactions occur or services are rendered, provided that persuasive evidence exists, the price to the client is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured.  Amounts accrued at period-end are recorded in accrued interest and fees receivable in our consolidated statement of condition. Performance fees generated by our investment management activities are recorded when the performance period is complete, based on predetermined benchmarks associated with the applicable fund's performance. Interest income on interest-earning assets and interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities are recorded in our consolidated statement of income as components of NII, and are generally based on the effective yield of the related financial asset or liability.

We recognized a pre-tax gain of $30 million, in the aggregate, in the year ended December 31, 2017 on these dispositions.  In the third quarter of 2017, we recognized a pre-tax gain of $26 million on the sale of an alternative trading platform. On July 1, 2016, we completed our acquisition of GE Asset Management (GEAM) from General Electric Company, with a total purchase price of approximately $485 million. We accounted for this acquisition as a business combination and, in accordance with ASC Topic 805, Business Combinations, we have recorded assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their respective fair values as of the acquisition date.  Our consolidated financial statements include the operating results for the acquired business from the date of acquisition, July 1, 2016. State Street Corporation | 128 Table of Contents STATE STREET CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Recent Accounting Developments Relevant standards that were recently issued but not yet adopted Standard Description Date of Adoption Effects on the financial statements or other significant matters ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) The standard, and its related amendments, will replace existing revenue recognition standards and expand the disclosure requirements for revenue arrangements with customers. Under the new standard, revenue is recognized when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services and is recognized in an amount that reflects the consideration which the entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services.  The guidance permits two methods of adoption: retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented (full retrospective method), or retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying the guidance recognized at the date of initial application (the modified retrospective method). January 1, 2018 The timing and amount of our material revenue streams, including servicing fees, management fees, trading services, and securities finance,  remain substantially unchanged as these revenues will continue to be recognized over time. Specifically, under the new standard we will recognize revenue related to these activities ratably over the term of the related agreements with customers as the customer simultaneously benefits from the services as they are performed. The standard does not apply to revenue associated with financial instruments, including loans and securities, or revenue recognized under other U.S. GAAP standards. Therefore NII, securities gains/ losses and revenue related to derivative instruments are not impacted by the standard. The new standard modified the principal and agent guidance requiring certain costs previously presented on a net basis to be presented on a gross basis, which we expect will increase 2018 revenue and expenses by an estimated $225 million, the majority reflected in Investment Management. We have adopted the new standard as of January 1, 2018, using the modified   retrospective method of adoption.  No material adjustment to retained earnings was required.     ASU 2016-01, Financial Instruments-Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities The standard makes limited amendments to the guidance on the classification and measurement of financial instruments.  Under the new standard, all equity securities will be measured at fair value through earnings with certain exceptions, including investments accounted for under the equity method of accounting.  In addition, the FASB clarified the guidance related to valuation allowance assessments when recognizing deferred tax assets on unrealized losses on available-for-sale debt securities. This standard must be applied on a retrospective basis. January 1, 2018  Upon adoption of the standard on January 1, 2018, we reclassified approximately $443 million of equity securities classified as available for sale to equity securities held at fair value through profit and loss.  The cumulative-effect transition adjustment recognized in retained earnings on January 1, 2018 was immaterial to the financial statements.    ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) The standard represents a wholesale change to lease accounting and requires all leases, other than short-term leases, to be reported on balance sheet through recognition of a right-of-use asset and a corresponding liability for future lease obligations.  The standard also requires extensive disclosures for assets, expenses, and cash flows associated with leases, as well as a maturity analysis of lease liabilities. January 1, 2019 We are currently assessing the impact of the standard on our consolidated financial statements, but we anticipate an increase in assets and liabilities due to the recognition of the required right-of-use asset and corresponding liability for all lease obligations that are currently classified as operating leases, primarily real estate leases for office space, as well as additional disclosure on all of our lease obligations. ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments The standard requires immediate recognition of expected credit losses for financial assets carried at amortized cost, including trade and other receivables, loans and commitments, held-to-maturity debt securities, and other financial assets,  held at the reporting date to be measured based on historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable supportable forecasts.  Credit losses on available for sale securities will be recorded as an allowance versus a write-down of the amortized cost basis of the security and will allow for a reversal of impairment loss when the credit of the issuer improves.  January 1, 2020 We are currently assessing the impact of the standard on our consolidated financial statements, and a significant implementation project is in place to ensure that expected credit losses are calculated in accordance with the standard.   We have established a steering committee to provide cross-functional governance over the project plan and key decisions, and are currently developing key accounting policies, assessing existing credit loss models against the new guidance and processes and identifying a complete set of data requirements and sources.  We have commenced the development of new or modified credit loss models and based on our analysis to date, we expect the timing of the allowance for credit losses to accelerate under the new standard.  We are continuing to assess the extent of the impact on the allowance for credit losses. State Street Corporation | 129 Table of Contents STATE STREET CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Relevant standards that were recently issued but not yet adopted (continued) Standard Description Date of Adoption Effects on the financial statements or other significant matters ASU 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments (a consensus of the Emerging Issues Task Force) The standard amends the statement of cash flow guidance to address specific cash flow issues with the objective of reducing the existing diversity in practice.  January 1, 2018  Based on our current presentation there is no significant change to our presentation of the statement of cash flows.     ASU 2017-01, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Clarifying the Definition of a Business The standard incorporates gating criteria to determine when an integrated set of assets and activities is not a business.  When substantially all the fair value of gross assets acquired (or group of similar identifiable assets) is concentrated in a single identifiable asset, it would not represent a business. January 1, 2018, early adoption permitted We have adopted this standard as of January 1, 2018 and will apply it prospectively to transactions occurring after adoption date, as applicable. ASU 2017-04, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment The standard simplifies the subsequent measurement of goodwill by eliminating Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test.  The ASU requires an entity to compare the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount and recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit.  Additionally, an entity should consider income tax effects from any tax deductible goodwill on the carrying amount of the reporting unit when measuring the goodwill impairment loss. January 1, 2020, early adoption permitted We are evaluating the impacts of early adoption, and will apply this standard prospectively upon adoption. ASU 2017-08, Receivables - Nonrefundable Fees and Other Costs (Subtopic 310-20): Premium Amortization on Purchased Callable Debt Securities The standard shortens the amortization period for certain purchased callable debt securities to the earliest call date. January 1, 2019, early adoption permitted We are currently evaluating the impact of the new standard and the early adoption provisions. ASU 2017-12, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities The standard amends the hedge accounting model to better portray the economics of risk management activities in the financial statements and enhances the presentation of hedge results. The amendments also make targeted changes to simplify the application of hedge accounting in certain situations. January 1, 2019, early adoption permitted We are currently evaluating the impact of the new standard and the early adoption provisions. Relevant standards that were adopted during the year ended December 31, 2017 We adopted ASU 2016-09, Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting, effective January 1, 2017.  Starting in the quarter ended March 31, 2017, we reclassified excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation from financing activities to other operating activities on the consolidated statement of cash flows.  We continued to present repurchases of common stock for employee tax withholding in financing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows for all periods presented. As required by the transition provisions of the standard, excess tax benefits previously recognized in surplus prior to January 1, 2017 remain in surplus, and excess tax benefits recognized after January 1, 2017 are included in income tax expense.  In connection with this change, we recognized a tax benefit of $24.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2017.  We elected to make no changes to our current policy of estimating forfeitures or our tax withholding rates. State Street Corporation | 130 Table of Contents STATE STREET CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Note 2.    Fair Value Fair Value Measurements We carry trading account assets and liabilities, AFS investment securities and various types of derivative financial instruments at fair value in our consolidated statement of condition on a recurring basis.  Changes in the fair values of these financial assets and liabilities are recorded either as components of our consolidated statement of income or as components of AOCI within shareholders' equity in our consolidated statement of condition. We measure fair value for the above-described financial assets and liabilities in conformity with U.S. GAAP that governs the measurement of the fair value of financial instruments.  Management believes that its valuation techniques and underlying assumptions used to measure fair value conform to the provisions of U.S. GAAP.  We categorize the financial assets and liabilities that we carry at fair value based on a prescribed three-level valuation hierarchy.  The hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (level 1) and the lowest priority to valuation methods using significant unobservable inputs (level 3).  If the inputs used to measure a financial asset or liability cross different levels of the hierarchy, categorization is based on the lowest-level input that is significant to the fair-value measurement.  Management's assessment of the significance of a particular input to the overall fair-value measurement of a financial asset or liability requires judgment, and considers factors specific to that asset or liability.  The three levels of the valuation hierarchy are described below. Level 1.  Financial assets and liabilities with values based on unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in an active market.  Our level 1 financial assets and liabilities primarily include positions in U.S. government securities and highly liquid U.S. and non-U.S. government fixed-income securities carried in trading account assets.  We may carry U.S. government securities in our AFS portfolio in connection with our asset-and-liability management activities.  Our level 1 financial assets also include active exchange-traded equity securities. Level 2.  Financial assets and liabilities with values based on quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, and inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the asset or liability.  Level 2 inputs include the following:  Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets;  Quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in non-active markets;  Pricing models whose inputs are observable for substantially the full term of the asset or liability; and  Pricing models whose inputs are derived principally from, or corroborated by, observable market information through correlation or other means for substantially the full term of the asset or liability. Our level 2 financial assets and liabilities primarily include non-U.S. debt securities carried in trading account assets and various types of fixed-income investment securities available-for-sale, as well as various types of foreign exchange and interest-rate derivative instruments. Fair value for our investment securities available-for-sale categorized in level 2 is measured primarily using information obtained from independent third parties.  This third-party information is subject to review by management as part of a validation process, which includes obtaining an understanding of the underlying assumptions and the level of market participant information used to support those assumptions.  In addition, management compares significant assumptions used by third parties to available market information.  Such information may include known trades or, to the extent that trading activity is limited, comparisons to market research information pertaining to credit expectations, execution prices and the timing of cash flows and, where information is available, back-testing. Derivative instruments categorized in level 2 predominantly represent foreign exchange contracts used in our trading activities, for which fair value is measured using discounted cash-flow techniques, with inputs consisting of observable spot and forward points, as well as observable interest-rate curves.  With respect to derivative instruments, we evaluate the impact on valuation of the credit risk of our counterparties and our own credit risk.  We consider factors such as the likelihood of default by us and our counterparties, our current and potential future net exposures and remaining maturities in determining the fair value.  Valuation adjustments associated with derivative instruments were not material to those instruments for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. Level 3.  Financial assets and liabilities with values based on prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both unobservable in the market and significant to the overall measurement of fair value.  These inputs reflect management's judgment about the assumptions that a market participant would use in pricing the financial asset or liability, and are based on the best available information, some of which is internally developed.  The following provides a more detailed discussion of State Street Corporation | 131 Table of Contents STATE STREET CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS our financial assets and liabilities that we may categorize in level 3 and the related valuation methodology.   The fair value of our investment securities categorized in level 3 is measured using information obtained from third-party sources, typically non-binding broker or dealer quotes, or through the use of internally-developed pricing models.  Management has evaluated its methodologies used to measure fair value, but has considered the level of observable market information to be insufficient to categorize the securities in level 2.   The fair value of certain foreign exchange contracts, primarily options, is measured using an option-pricing model.  Because of a limited number of observable transactions, certain model inputs are not observable, such as implied volatility surface, but are derived from observable market information. Our level 3 financial assets and liabilities are similar in structure and profile to our level 1 and level 2 financial instruments, but they trade in less liquid markets, and the measurement of their fair value is inherently more difficult. The following tables present information with respect to our financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value in our consolidated statement of condition on a recurring basis as of the dates indicated.  During 2017, approximately $9 million of assets were transferred between levels 1 and 2.  No transfers of financial assets or liabilities between levels 1 and 2 occurred during 2016.

State Street Corporation | 134 Table of Contents STATE STREET CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The following tables present activity related to our level 3 financial assets during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.  Transfers into and out of level 3 are reported as of the beginning of the period presented.  During the year ended December 31, 2017, transfers into level 3 were mainly related to certain ABS and MBS, including non-U.S. debt securities, and municipal loans for which fair value was measured using information obtained from third-party sources, including non-binding broker or dealer quotes. During the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, transfers out of level 3 were mainly related to certain MBS and ABS, including non-U.S. debt securities, for which fair value was measured using prices for which observable market information became available.

State Street Corporation | 136 Table of Contents STATE STREET CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Fair Value Estimates Estimates of fair value for financial instruments not carried at fair value on a recurring basis in our consolidated statement of condition are generally subjective in nature, and are determined as of a specific point in time based on the characteristics of the financial instruments and relevant market information.  Disclosure of fair value estimates is not required by U.S. GAAP for certain items, such as lease financing, equity-method investments, obligations for pension and other post-retirement plans, premises and equipment, other intangible assets and income-tax assets and liabilities.  Accordingly, aggregate fair-value estimates presented do not purport to represent, and should not be considered representative of, our underlying ""market"" or franchise value.  In addition, because of potential differences in methodologies and assumptions used to estimate fair values, our estimates of fair value should not be compared to those of other financial institutions. We use the following methods to estimate the fair values of our financial instruments:  For financial instruments that have quoted market prices, those quoted prices are used to estimate fair value.  For financial instruments that have no defined maturity, have a remaining maturity of 180 days or less, or reprice frequently to a market rate, we assume that the fair value of these instruments approximates their reported value, after taking into consideration any applicable credit risk.  For financial instruments for which no quoted market prices are available, fair value is estimated using information obtained from independent third parties, or by discounting the expected cash flows using an estimated current market interest rate for the financial instrument. The generally short duration of certain of our assets and liabilities results in a significant number of financial instruments for which fair value equals or closely approximates the amount recorded in our consolidated statement of condition.  These financial instruments are reported in the following captions in our consolidated statement of condition: cash and due from banks; interest-bearing deposits with banks; securities purchased under resale agreements; accrued interest and fees receivable; deposits; securities sold under repurchase agreements; and other short-term borrowings. In addition, due to the relatively short duration of certain of our loans, we consider fair value for these loans to approximate their reported value.  The fair value of other types of loans, such as senior secured bank loans, commercial real estate loans, purchased receivables and municipal loans is estimated using information obtained from independent third parties or by discounting expected future cash flows using current rates at which similar loans would be made to borrowers with similar credit ratings for the same remaining maturities.  Commitments to lend have no reported value because their terms are at prevailing market rates.

Investment Securities Investment securities held by us are classified as either trading, AFS, or HTM at the time of purchase and reassessed periodically, based on management's intent. Generally, trading assets are debt and equity securities purchased in connection with our trading activities and, as such, are expected to be sold in the near term.  Our trading activities typically involve active and frequent buying and selling with the objective of generating profits on short-term movements.  AFS investment securities are those securities that we intend to hold for an indefinite period of time.  AFS investment securities include securities utilized as part of our asset-and-liability management activities that may be sold in response to changes in interest rates, prepayment risk, liquidity needs or other factors.  HTM securities are debt securities that management has the intent and the ability to hold to maturity. Trading assets are carried at fair value.  Both realized and unrealized gains and losses on trading assets are recorded in trading services revenue in our consolidated statement of income.  Debt and marketable equity securities classified as AFS are carried at fair value, and after-tax net unrealized gains and losses are recorded in AOCI.  Gains or losses realized on sales of AFS investment securities are computed using the specific identification method and are recorded in gains (losses) related to investment securities, net, in our consolidated statement of income.  HTM investment securities are carried at cost, adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts.

State Street Corporation | 140 Table of Contents STATE STREET CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Aggregate investment securities with carrying values of approximately $48 billion and $46 billion as of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively, were designated as pledged for public and trust deposits, short-term borrowings and for other purposes as provided by law. In 2017, we sold $12.2 billion of AFS, primarily Agency MBS and U.S. Treasury securities in our investment portfolio, to position for the then-existing interest rate environment resulting in a pre-tax loss of $39 million. In 2017, $496 million of Agency MBS previously classified as AFS were transferred to HTM, and in 2016, $4.9 billion, of Agency MBS and Student Loan ABS previously classified as AFS were transferred to HTM.  Both transfers reflect our intent to hold these securities until their maturity.  These securities were transferred at fair value, which included a net unrealized loss of $2.8 million and a net unrealized gain of $87 million as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, within accumulated other comprehensive loss which will be accreted into interest income over the remaining life of the transferred security (ranging from approximately 10 to 42 years). The following tables present the aggregate fair values of investment securities that have been in a continuous unrealized loss position for less than 12 months, and those that have been in a continuous unrealized loss position for 12 months or longer, as of the dates indicated: Less than 12 months   12 months or longer   Total December 31, 2017 Fair Value   Gross Unrealized Losses   Fair Value   Gross Unrealized Losses   Fair Value   Gross Unrealized Losses (In millions)           Available-for-sale:                       U.S. Treasury and federal agencies:                       Direct obligations $  -

The maturities of certain ABS, MBS, and CMOs are based on expected principal payments.  Actual maturities may differ from these expected maturities since certain borrowers have the right to prepay obligations with or without prepayment penalties.

The level rate of return considers any non-refundable fees or costs, as well as purchase premiums or discounts, resulting in amortization or accretion, accordingly. For certain debt securities acquired which are considered to be beneficial interests in securitized financial assets, the excess of our estimate of undiscounted future cash flows from these securities over their initial recorded investment is accreted into interest income on a level-yield basis over the securities' estimated remaining terms.  Subsequent decreases in these securities' expected future cash flows are either recognized prospectively through an adjustment of the yields on the securities over their remaining terms, or are evaluated for OTTI. Increases in expected future cash flows are recognized prospectively over the securities' estimated remaining terms through the recalculation of their yields. Impairment We conduct periodic reviews of individual securities to assess whether OTTI exists.  Impairment exists when the current fair value of an individual security is below its amortized cost basis.  For AFS and HTM debt securities, impairment is recorded in our consolidated statement of income when management intends to sell (or may be required to sell) the securities before they recover in value, or when management expects the present value of cash flows expected to be collected from the securities to be less than the amortized cost of the impaired security (a credit loss). Our review of impaired securities generally includes:  the identification and evaluation of securities that have indications of potential OTTI, such as issuer-specific concerns, including deteriorating financial condition or bankruptcy;  the analysis of expected future cash flows of securities, based on quantitative and qualitative factors;  the analysis of the collectability of those future cash flows, including information about past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts;  the analysis of the underlying collateral for MBS and ABS;  the analysis of individual impaired securities, including consideration of the length of time the security has been in an unrealized loss position, the anticipated recovery period, and the magnitude of the overall price decline;  evaluation of factors or triggers that could cause individual securities to be deemed OTTI and those that would not support OTTI; and  documentation of the results of these analyses. Factors considered in determining whether impairment is other than temporary include:  certain macroeconomic drivers;  certain industry-specific drivers;  the length of time the security has been impaired;  the severity of the impairment; State Street Corporation | 144 Table of Contents STATE STREET CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  the cause of the impairment and the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer;  activity in the market with respect to the issuer's securities, which may indicate adverse credit conditions; and  our intention not to sell, and the likelihood that we will not be required to sell, the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for its recovery in value. Substantially all of our investment securities portfolio is composed of debt securities.  A critical component of our assessment of OTTI of these debt securities is the identification of credit-impaired securities for which management does not expect to receive cash flows sufficient to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security. Debt securities that are not deemed to be credit-impaired are subject to additional management analysis to assess whether management intends to sell, or, more likely than not, would be required to sell, the security before the expected recovery of its amortized cost basis. The following provides a description of our process for the identification and assessment of OTTI, as well as information about OTTI recorded in 2017, 2016 and 2015 and changes in period-end unrealized losses, for major security types as of December 31, 2017. U.S. Agency Securities Our portfolio of U.S. agency direct obligations and MBS receives the implicit or explicit backing of the U.S. government in conjunction with specified financial support of the U.S. Treasury.  We recorded no OTTI on these securities in 2017, 2016 or 2015. The overall increase in the unrealized losses on these securities as of December 31, 2017 was primarily attributable to interest rate increases in 2017. Asset-Backed Securities - Student Loans Asset-backed securities collateralized by student loans are primarily composed of securities collateralized by FFELP loans.  FFELP loans benefit from a federal government guarantee of at least 97% of defaulted principal and accrued interest, with additional credit support provided to our securities in the form of over-collateralization, subordination and excess spread, which collectively total in excess of 100%.  Accordingly, the vast majority of FFELP loan-backed securities are protected from traditional consumer credit risk. We recorded no OTTI on these securities in 2017, 2016 or 2015.The improvement in the mark to market for our FFELP loan-backed securities portfolio as of December 31, 2017 was primarily attributable to the tightening FFELP spreads. Our assessment of OTTI of these securities considers, among many other factors, the strength of the U.S. government guarantee, the performance of the underlying collateral, and the remaining average term of the FFELP loan-backed securities portfolio, which was approximately 4.6 years as of December 31, 2017. In general, the rating agencies have largely completed their downgrade review of FFELP loan-backed securities due to potential extension of student loan repayments beyond the securities' legal final maturity dates.  At this time, we do not expect a significant number of additional downgrades related to potential legal final maturity breaches.  Based on the limited price impact on the overall FFELP loan-backed securities portfolio and recent remedial actions by issuers, including amending loan-backed securities' maturity dates and exercising cleanup calls, the credit quality of the FFELP loan-backed securities portfolio remains stable and we, as a bondholder, remain protected from principal loss as a result of the aforementioned federal government guarantee and over-collateralization.  Downside risks remain should remedial actions fail to address the extension risks. Our total exposure to private student loan-backed securities was less than $70 million as of December 31, 2017.  Our assessment of OTTI of private student loan-backed securities considers, among other factors, the impact of high unemployment rates on the collateral performance of private student loans.  We recorded no OTTI on these securities in 2017, 2016 or 2015. Non-U.S. Mortgage- and Asset-Backed Securities Non-U.S. mortgage- and asset-backed securities are primarily composed of U.K., Australian and Dutch securities collateralized by residential mortgages and German and U.K. securities collateralized by automobile loans and leases. Our assessment of impairment with respect to these securities considers the location of the underlying collateral, collateral enhancement and structural features, expected credit losses under base-case and stressed conditions and the macroeconomic outlook for the country in which the collateral is located, including housing prices and unemployment. Where appropriate, any potential loss after consideration of the above-referenced factors is further evaluated to determine whether any OTTI exists. We recorded OTTI of less than $1 million, $2 million and $1 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, on non-U.S. residential MBS, which resulted from adverse changes in the timing of expected future cash flows from the securities. State Street Corporation | 145 Table of Contents STATE STREET CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Our assessment of OTTI of these securities takes into account government intervention in the corresponding mortgage markets and assumes a  baseline macroeconomic environment for this region, factoring in slower economic growth and continued government austerity measures.  In addition, we perform stress testing and sensitivity analysis in order to understand the impact of more severe assumptions on potential OTTI. State and Political Subdivisions and Other U.S. Debt Securities Our municipal securities portfolio primarily includes securities issued by U.S. states and their municipalities.  A portion of this portfolio is held in connection with our tax-exempt investment program, more fully described in Note 14. Our portfolio of other U.S. debt securities is primarily composed of securities issued by U.S. corporations. Our assessment of OTTI of these portfolios considers, among other factors, adverse conditions specifically related to the industry, geographic area or financial condition of the issuer; the structure of the security, including collateral, if any, and payment schedule; rating agency changes to the security's credit rating; the volatility of the fair value changes; and our intent and ability to hold the security until its recovery in value.  If the impairment of the security is credit-related, we estimate the future cash flows from the security, tailored to the security and considering the above-described factors, and any resulting impairment deemed to be other-than-temporary is recorded in our consolidated statement of income. We recorded no OTTI on these securities in 2017, 2016 or 2015. The decline in the unrealized losses on these securities as of December 31, 2017 was primarily attributable to the narrowing of spreads and U.S. Treasury rates in 2017. U.S. Non-Agency Residential Mortgage-Backed Securities We assess OTTI of our portfolio of U.S. non-agency residential mortgage-backed securities using cash flow models, tailored for each security, that estimate the future cash flows from the underlying mortgages, using the security-specific collateral and transaction structure. Estimates of future cash flows are subject to management judgment. The future cash flows and performance of our portfolio of U.S. non-agency residential mortgage-backed securities are a function of a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the condition of the U.S. economy, the condition of the U.S. residential mortgage markets, and the level of loan defaults, prepayments and loss severities. Management's estimates of future losses for each security also consider the underwriting and historical performance of each specific security, the underlying collateral type, vintage, borrower profile, third-party guarantees, current levels of subordination, geography and other factors. We recorded no OTTI on these securities in 2017, 2016 or 2015. U.S. Non-Agency Commercial Mortgage-Backed Securities With respect to our portfolio of U.S. non-agency commercial mortgage-backed securities, OTTI is assessed by considering a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the condition of the U.S. economy and the condition of the U.S. commercial real estate market, as well as capitalization rates. Management estimates of future losses for each security also consider the underlying collateral type, property location, vintage, debt-service coverage ratios, expected property income, servicer advances and estimated property values, as well as current levels of subordination.  We recorded no OTTI on these securities in 2017 and 2015. In 2016 we recorded $1 million of OTTI on these securities, all associated with expected credit losses. The estimates, assumptions and other risk factors utilized in our assessment of impairment as described above are used by management to identify securities which are subject to further analysis of potential credit losses.  Additional analyses are performed using more stressful assumptions to further evaluate the sensitivity of losses relative to the above-described factors.  However, since the assumptions are based on the unique characteristics of each security, management uses a range of estimates for prepayment speeds, default, and loss severity forecasts that reflect the collateral profile of the securities within each asset class.  In addition, in measuring expected credit losses, the individual characteristics of each security are examined to determine whether any additional factors would increase or mitigate the expected loss.  Once losses are determined, the timing of the loss will also affect the ultimate OTTI, since the loss is ultimately subject to a discount commensurate with the purchase yield of the security. After a review of the investment portfolio, taking into consideration current economic conditions, adverse situations that might affect our ability to fully collect principal and interest, the timing of future payments, the credit quality and performance of the collateral underlying MBS and ABS and other relevant factors, management considers the aggregate decline in fair value of the investment securities portfolio and the resulting gross pre-tax unrealized losses of $657 million related to 1,283 securities as of December 31, 2017 to be temporary, and not the result of any material changes in the credit characteristics of the securities. State Street Corporation | 146 Table of Contents STATE STREET CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Note 4.    Loans and Leases Loans are generally recorded at their principal amount outstanding, net of the allowance for loan losses, unearned income, and any net unamortized deferred loan origination fees.  Acquired loans have been initially recorded at fair value based on management's expectation with respect to future principal and interest collection as of the date of acquisition.  Acquired loans are held for investment, and as such their initial fair value is not adjusted subsequent to acquisition.  Loans that are classified as held-for-sale are measured at lower of cost or fair value on an individual basis. Interest income related to loans is recognized in our consolidated statement of income using the interest method, or on a basis approximating a level rate of return over the term of the loan.  Fees received for providing loan commitments and letters of credit that we anticipate will result in loans typically are deferred and amortized to interest income over the term of the related loan, beginning with the initial borrowing.  Fees on commitments and letters of credit are amortized to processing fees and other revenue over the commitment period when funding is not known or expected. Leveraged-lease investments are reported at the aggregate of lease payments receivable and estimated residual values, net of non-recourse debt and unearned income.  Lease residual values are reviewed regularly for OTTI, with valuation adjustments recorded against processing fees and other revenue.  Unearned income is recognized to yield a level rate of return on the net investment in the leases.  Gains and losses on residual values of leased equipment sold are recorded in processing fees and other revenue. The following table presents our recorded investment in loans and leases, by segment, as of the dates indicated: (In millions) December 31, 2017   December 31, 2016 Domestic:       Commercial and financial:       Loans to investment funds $ 13,618     $ 11,734   Senior secured bank loans 2,923     3,256   Loans to municipalities 2,105     1,352   Other 50     70   Commercial real estate 98     27   Lease financing 267     338   Total domestic 19,061     16,777   Non-U.S.:       Commercial and financial:       Loans to investment funds 3,213     2,224   Senior secured bank loans 624     252   Lease financing 396     504   Total non-U.S. 4,233     2,980   Total loans and leases 23,294     19,757   Allowance for loan and lease losses (54 )   (53 ) Loans and leases, net of allowance $ 23,240     $ 19,704 We segregate our loans and leases into three segments: commercial and financial loans, commercial real estate loans, and lease financing.  We further classify commercial and financial loans as loans to investment funds, senior secured bank loans, loans to municipalities, and other.  These classifications reflect their risk characteristics, their initial measurement attributes and the methods we use to monitor and assess credit risk. The commercial and financial segment is composed of primarily floating-rate loans to mutual fund clients, purchased senior secured bank loans, and loans to municipalities.  Investment fund lending is composed of short-duration revolving credit lines providing liquidity to fund clients in support of their transaction flows associated with securities' settlement activities. Certain loans are pledged as collateral for access to the Federal Reserve's discount window.  As of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, the loans pledged as collateral totaled $1.9 billion and $1.5 billion, respectively. The lease financing segment includes our investment in leveraged lease financing.  The components of our net investment in leveraged lease financing, included in the lease financing segment in the preceding table, were as follows as of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016: (In millions) 2017   2016 Net rental income receivable $ 808     $ 1,039   Estimated residual values 89     89   Unearned income (234 )   (286 ) Investment in leveraged lease financing 663     842   Less: related deferred income tax liabilities (184 )   (313 ) Net investment in leveraged lease financing $ 479     $ 529 State Street Corporation | 147 Table of Contents STATE STREET CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The following tables present our recorded investment in each class of loans and leases by credit quality indicator as of the dates indicated:        December 31, 2017 Commercial and Financial   Commercial Real Estate   Lease Financing   Total Loans and Leases (In millions) Investment grade(1) $ 17,866     $ 98     $ 663     $ 18,627   Speculative(2) 4,638      -       -      4,638   Special mention(3) 29      -       -      29   Total $ 22,533     $ 98     $ 663     $ 23,294 December 31, 2016 Commercial and Financial   Commercial Real Estate   Lease Financing   Total Loans and Leases (In millions) Investment grade(1) $ 14,889     $ 27     $ 842     $ 15,758   Speculative(2) 3,984      -       -      3,984   Substandard(4) 15      -       -      15   Total $ 18,888     $ 27     $ 842     $ 19,757 (1)  Investment-grade loans and leases consist of counterparties with strong credit quality and low expected credit risk and probability of default.  Ratings apply to counterparties with a strong capacity to support the timely repayment of any financial commitment. (2)  Speculative loans and leases consist of counterparties that face ongoing uncertainties or exposure to business, financial, or economic downturns.  However, these counterparties may have financial flexibility or access to financial alternatives, which allow for financial commitments to be met. (3)  Special mention loans and leases consist of counterparties with potential weaknesses that, if uncorrected, may result in deterioration of repayment prospects. (4) Substandard loans and leases consist of counterparties with well-defined weakness that jeopardizes repayment with the possibility we will sustain some loss We use an internal risk-rating system to assess our risk of credit loss for each loan or lease.  This risk-rating process incorporates the use of risk-rating tools in conjunction with management judgment.  Qualitative and quantitative inputs are captured in a systematic manner, and following a formal review and approval process, an internal credit rating based on our credit scale is assigned. In assessing the risk rating assigned to each individual loan or lease, among the factors considered are the borrower's debt capacity, collateral coverage, payment history and delinquency experience, financial flexibility and earnings strength, the expected amounts and source of repayment, the level and nature of contingencies, if any, and the industry and geography in which the borrower operates.  These factors are based on an evaluation of historical and current information, and involve subjective assessment and interpretation.  Credit counterparties are evaluated and risk-rated on an individual basis at least annually.  Management considers the ratings to be current as of December 31, 2017. The following table presents our recorded investment in loans and leases, disaggregated based on our impairment methodology, as of the dates indicated: December 31, 2017   December 31, 2016 (In millions) Commercial and Financial   Commercial Real Estate   Lease Financing   Total Loans and Leases   Commercial and Financial   Commercial Real Estate   Lease Financing   Total Loans and Leases Loans and leases(1):                               Individually evaluated for impairment $  -      $  -      $  -      $  -      $ 15     $  -      $  -      $ 15   Collectively evaluated for impairment 22,533     98     663     23,294     18,873     27     842     19,742   Total $ 22,533     $ 98     $ 663     $ 23,294     $ 18,888     $ 27     $ 842     $ 19,757 (1)  For those portfolios where there are a small number of loans each with a large balance, we review each loan annually for indicators of impairment.  For those loans where no such indicators are identified, the loans are collectively evaluated for impairment.  As of December 31, 2017 , no loans were individually evaluated for impairment. As of December 31, 2016, $195 thousand of the allowance for loan and lease loss related to commercial and financial loans were individually evaluated for impairment, and the remainder of the allowance related to commercial and financial loans collectively evaluated for impairment. State Street Corporation | 148 Table of Contents STATE STREET CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS As of December 31, 2017, we had no impaired loans and leases.  As of December 31, 2016, we identified one commercial and financial loan as impaired, with both a recorded investment and unpaid principal balance of $15 million.  The impaired loan had zero related interest income and an associated allowance for loan losses of $0.2 million. In certain circumstances, we restructure troubled loans by granting concessions to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty.  Once restructured, the loans are generally considered impaired until their maturity, regardless of whether the borrowers perform under the modified terms of the loans.  No loans were modified in troubled debt restructurings during the years ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016. We generally place loans on non-accrual status once principal or interest payments are 90 days contractually past due, or earlier if management determines that full collection is not probable.  Loans 90 days past due, but considered both well-secured and in the process of collection, may be excluded from non-accrual status.  When we place a loan on non-accrual status, the accrual of interest is discontinued and previously recorded but unpaid interest is reversed and generally charged against interest income.  For loans on non-accrual status, income is recognized on a cash basis after recovery of principal, if and when interest payments are received.  Loans may be removed from non-accrual status when repayment is reasonably assured and performance under the terms of the loan has been demonstrated. As of December 31, 2017, there were no loans or leases on non-accrual status.  As of December 31, 2016, there was one commercial and financial loan on non-accrual status, and no CRE loans or leases were on non-accrual status.  As of both December 31, 2017 and 2016 there were no loans or leases 90 days or more contractually past due. Allowance For Loan And Lease Losses The allowance for loan and lease losses, recorded as a reduction of loans and leases in our consolidated statement of condition, represents management's estimate of incurred credit losses in our loan and lease portfolio as of the balance sheet date.  The allowance is evaluated on a regular basis by management.  Factors considered in evaluating the appropriate level of the allowance for each segment of our loan-and-lease portfolio include loss experience, the probability of default reflected in our internal risk rating of the counterparty's creditworthiness, current economic conditions and adverse situations that may affect the borrower's ability to repay, the estimated value of the underlying collateral, if any, the performance of individual credits in relation to contract terms, and other relevant factors. Loans and leases are charged off to the allowance for loan and lease losses in the reporting period in which either an event occurs that confirms the existence of a loss on a loan or lease or a portion of a loan or lease is determined to be uncollectible.  In addition, any impaired loan or lease that is determined to be collateral-dependent is reduced to an amount equal to the fair value of the collateral less costs to sell.  A loan or lease is identified as collateral-dependent when management determines that it is probable that the underlying collateral will be the sole source of repayment.  Recoveries are recorded on a cash basis as adjustments to the allowance. The following table presents activity in the allowance for loan and lease losses for the periods indicated: Years Ended December 31,   2017   2016   2015 (In millions) Total Loans and Leases   Total Loans and Leases   Total Loans and Leases Allowance for loan and lease losses(1):           Beginning balance $ 53     $ 46     $ 38   Provision for loan and lease losses 2     10     12   Charge-offs (1 )   (3 )   (4 ) Ending balance $ 54     $ 53     $ 46 (1)  The provisions and charge-offs for loans and leases were attributable to exposure to senior secured loans to non-investment grade borrowers, purchased in connection with our participation in syndicated loans. Loans and leases are reviewed on a regular basis, and any provisions for loan and lease losses that are recorded reflect management's estimate of the amount necessary to maintain the allowance for loan and lease losses at a level considered appropriate to absorb estimated incurred losses in the loan and lease portfolio. Off-Balance Sheet Credit Exposures The reserve for off-balance sheet credit exposures, recorded in accrued expenses and other liabilities in our consolidated statement of condition, represents management's estimate of probable credit losses in outstanding letters and lines of credit and other credit-enhancement facilities provided to our clients and outstanding as of the balance sheet date. The reserve is evaluated on a regular basis by management. Factors considered in evaluating the appropriate level of this reserve are similar to those considered with respect to the allowance for loan and lease losses. Provisions to maintain the reserve at a level considered by us to be appropriate to absorb estimated incurred credit losses in outstanding facilities are recorded in other expenses in our consolidated statement of income. State Street Corporation | 149 Table of Contents STATE STREET CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Note 5.    Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the net tangible and other intangible assets acquired.  Other intangible assets represent purchased long-lived intangible assets, primarily client relationships and core deposit intangible assets, that can be distinguished from goodwill because of contractual rights or because the asset can be exchanged on its own or in combination with a related contract, asset or liability.  Goodwill is not amortized, but is subject to at least annual evaluation for impairment.  Other intangible assets, which are also subject to annual evaluation for impairment, are mainly related to client relationships, which are amortized on a straight-line basis over periods ranging from five to twenty years, and core deposit intangible assets, which are amortized on a straight-line basis over periods ranging from sixteen to twenty-two years, with such amortization recorded in other expenses in our consolidated statement of income. Impairment of goodwill is deemed to exist if the carrying value of a reporting unit, including its allocation of goodwill and other intangible assets, exceeds its estimated fair value.  Impairment of other intangible assets is deemed to exist if the balance of the other intangible asset exceeds the cumulative expected net cash inflows related to the asset over its remaining estimated useful life.  If these reviews determine that goodwill or other intangible assets are impaired, the value of the goodwill or the other intangible asset is written down through a charge to other expenses in our consolidated statement of income.

Refer to Note 20 for additional information. Note 10.    Derivative Financial Instruments A derivative financial instrument is a financial instrument or other contract which has one or more referenced indices and one or more notional amounts, either no initial net investment or a smaller initial net investment than would be expected for similar types of contracts, and which requires or permits net settlement. We use derivative financial instruments to support our clients' needs and to manage our interest-rate and currency risk.  In undertaking these activities, we assume positions in both the foreign exchange and interest-rate markets by buying and selling cash instruments and using derivative financial instruments, including foreign exchange forward contracts, foreign exchange options and interest-rate contracts.  Our derivative positions include derivative contracts held by a consolidated sponsored investment fund (refer to Note 14).  We record derivatives in our consolidated statement of condition at their fair value on a recurring basis. Interest rate contracts involve an agreement with a counterparty to exchange cash flows based on the movement of an underlying interest rate index.  An interest rate swap agreement involves the exchange of a series of interest payments, at either a fixed or variable rate, based on the notional amount without the exchange of the underlying principal amount.  An interest rate option contract provides the purchaser, for a premium, the right, but not the obligation, to receive an interest rate based upon a predetermined notional amount during a specified period.  An interest State Street Corporation | 153 Table of Contents STATE STREET CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS rate futures contract is a commitment to buy or sell, at a future date, a financial instrument at a contracted price; it may be settled in cash or through the delivery of the contracted instrument. Foreign exchange contracts involve an agreement to exchange one currency for another currency at an agreed-upon rate and settlement date. Foreign exchange contracts generally consist of foreign exchange forward and spot contracts, option contracts and cross-currency swaps.  Future cash requirements, if any, related to foreign exchange contracts are represented by the gross amount of currencies to be exchanged under each contract unless we and the counterparty have agreed to pay or to receive the net contractual settlement amount on the settlement date. Derivative financial instruments involve the management of interest-rate and foreign currency risk, and involve, to varying degrees, market risk and credit and counterparty risk (risk related to repayment).  Market risk is defined by U.S. banking regulators as the risk of loss that could result from broad market movements, such as changes in the general level of interest rates, credit spreads, foreign exchange rates or commodity prices.  We use a variety of risk management tools and methodologies to measure, monitor and manage the market risk associated with our trading activities, which include our use of derivative financial instruments.  One such risk-management measure is VaR.  VaR is an estimate of potential loss for a given period within a stated statistical confidence interval.  We use a risk measurement system to measure VaR daily.  We have adopted standards for measuring VaR, and we maintain regulatory capital for market risk in accordance with currently applicable regulatory market risk requirements. Derivative financial instruments are also subject to credit and counterparty risk, which we manage by performing credit reviews, maintaining individual counterparty limits, entering into netting arrangements and requiring the receipt of collateral. Cash collateral received from and provided to counterparties in connection with derivative financial instruments is recorded in accrued expenses and other liabilities and other assets, respectively, in our consolidated statement of condition.  As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, we had recorded approximately $2.55 billion and $1.99 billion, respectively, of cash collateral received from counterparties and approximately $869 million and $4.39 billion, respectively, of cash collateral provided to counterparties in connection with derivative financial instruments in our consolidated statement of condition. Certain of our derivative assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 are subject to master netting agreements with our derivative counterparties.  Certain of these agreements contain credit risk-related contingent features in which the counterparty has the right to declare us in default and accelerate cash settlement of our net derivative liabilities with the counterparty in the event that our credit rating falls below specified levels.  The aggregate fair value of all derivative instruments with credit risk-related contingent features that were in a net liability position as of December 31, 2017 totaled approximately $1.13 billion, against which we provided no underlying collateral.  If our credit rating were downgraded below levels specified in the agreements, the maximum additional amount of payments related to termination events that could have been required pursuant to these contingent features, assuming no change in fair value, as of December 31, 2017 was approximately $1.13 billion. Such accelerated settlement would be at fair value and therefore not affect our consolidated results of operations. On the date a derivative contract is entered into, we designate the derivative as: (1) a hedge of the fair value of a recognized fixed-rate asset or liability or of an unrecognized firm commitment (a ""fair value"" hedge); (2) a hedge of a forecast transaction or of the variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to a recognized variable-rate asset or liability (a ""cash flow"" hedge); (3) a foreign currency fair value or cash flow hedge (a ""foreign currency"" hedge); (4) a hedge of a net investment in a non-U.S. operation; or (5) a derivative utilized in either our trading activities or in our asset-and-liability management activities that is not designated as a hedge of an asset or liability. Unrealized gains and losses on foreign exchange and interest-rate contracts are reported at fair value in our consolidated statement of condition as a component of other assets and accrued expenses and other liabilities, respectively, on a gross basis, except where such gains and losses arise from contracts covered by qualifying master netting agreements. Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments In connection with our trading activities, we use derivative financial instruments in our role as a financial intermediary and as both a manager and servicer of financial assets, in order to accommodate our clients' investment and risk management needs. In addition, we use derivative financial instruments for risk management purposes as economic hedges, which are not formally designated as accounting hedges, in order to contribute to our overall corporate earnings and liquidity.  These activities are designed State Street Corporation | 154 Table of Contents STATE STREET CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS to generate trading services revenue and to manage volatility in our NII.  The level of market risk that we assume is a function of our overall objectives and liquidity needs, our clients' requirements and market volatility. With respect to cross-border investing, our clients often enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to convert currency for international investments and to manage the currency risk in their international investment portfolios.  As an active participant in the foreign exchange markets, we provide foreign exchange forward contracts and options in support of these client needs, and also act as a dealer in the currency markets.  As part of our trading activities, we assume positions in both the foreign exchange and interest-rate markets by buying and selling cash instruments and using derivative financial instruments, including foreign exchange forward contracts, foreign exchange and interest-rate options and interest rate swaps, interest rate forward contracts, and interest rate futures.  In the aggregate, we seek to match positions closely with the objective of minimizing related currency and interest-rate risk.  We also use foreign currency swap contracts to manage the foreign exchange risk associated with certain foreign currency-denominated liabilities. The foreign exchange swap contracts are entered into for periods generally consistent with foreign currency exposure of the underlying transactions. The entire change in the fair value of the derivatives utilized in our trading activities are recorded in trading services revenue, and the entire change in fair value of derivatives utilized in our asset-and-liability management activities are recorded in processing fees and other revenue. We offer products that provide book-value protection primarily to plan participants in stable value funds managed by non-affiliated investment managers of post-retirement defined contribution benefit plans, particularly 401(k) plans.  We account for the associated contingencies, more fully described in Note 12, individually as derivative financial instruments.  These contracts are valued quarterly and unrealized losses, if any, are recorded in other expenses in our consolidated statement of income. We grant deferred cash awards to certain of our employees as part of our employee incentive compensation plans.  We account for these awards as derivative financial instruments, as the underlying referenced shares are not equity instruments of State Street.  The fair value of these derivatives is referenced to the value of units in State Street-sponsored investment funds or funds sponsored by other unrelated entities.  We re-measure these derivatives to fair value quarterly, and record the change in value in compensation and employee benefits expenses in our consolidated statement of income. Derivatives Designated as Hedging Instruments In connection with our asset-and-liability management activities, we use derivative financial instruments to manage our interest rate risk and foreign currency risk.  Interest rate risk, defined as the sensitivity of income or financial condition to variations in interest rates, is a significant non-trading market risk to which our assets and liabilities are exposed.  We manage our interest rate risk by identifying, quantifying and hedging our exposures, using fixed-rate portfolio securities and a variety of derivative financial instruments, most frequently interest-rate swaps.  Interest rate swap agreements alter the interest-rate characteristics of specific balance sheet assets or liabilities. We use foreign exchange forward and swap contracts to hedge foreign exchange exposure to various foreign currencies with respect to certain assets and liabilities.  Our hedging relationships are formally designated, and qualify for hedge accounting, as fair value, cash flow or net investment hedges. At both the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, we formally assess and document the effectiveness of a derivative designated in a hedging relationship and the likelihood that the derivative will be an effective hedge in future periods.  We discontinue hedge accounting prospectively when we determine that the derivative is no longer highly effective in offsetting changes in fair value or cash flows of the underlying risk being hedged, the derivative expires, terminates or is sold, or management discontinues the hedge designation. Fair Value Hedges Derivatives designated as fair value hedges are utilized to mitigate the risk of changes in the fair values of recognized assets and liabilities. Differences between the gains and losses on the hedging derivative and the gains and losses on the hedged asset or liability attributable to the hedged risk represent hedge ineffectiveness.  We use interest rate or foreign exchange contracts in this manner to manage our exposure to changes in the fair value of hedged items caused by changes in interest rates or foreign exchange rates.  Changes in the fair value of a derivative that is highly effective, and that is designated and qualifies as a fair value hedge, are recorded in processing fees and other revenue, along with the changes in fair value of the hedged asset or liability attributable to the hedged risk. We have entered into interest rate swap agreements to modify our interest income from certain AFS investment securities from a fixed rate to a floating rate.  The hedged AFS investment securities included hedged trusts that had a State Street Corporation | 155 Table of Contents STATE STREET CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS weighted-average life of approximately 4.6 years as of December 31, 2017, compared to 4.5 years as of December 31, 2016.  These trusts are hedged with interest rate swap contracts of similar maturity, repricing frequency and fixed-rate coupons.  The interest rate swap contracts convert the interest income from a fixed rate to a floating rate indexed to LIBOR, thereby mitigating our exposure to fluctuations in the fair value of the securities attributable to changes in the benchmark interest rate. We have entered into interest rate swap agreements to modify our interest expense on eight senior notes and one subordinated note from fixed rates to floating rates.  The senior and subordinated notes are hedged with interest rate swap contracts with notional amounts, maturities and fixed-rate coupon terms that effectively hedge the fixed-rate notes.  The interest rate swap contracts convert the fixed-rate coupons to floating rates indexed to LIBOR, thereby mitigating our exposure to fluctuations in the fair values of the senior and subordinated notes stemming from changes in the benchmark interest rates.  The table below summarizes the maturities and the paid fixed interest rates for the hedged senior and subordinated notes: December 31, 2017   Maturity   Paid Fixed Interest Rate Senior Notes             2020   2.55%     2021   4.38     2021   1.95     2022   2.65     2023   3.70     2024   3.30     2025   3.55     2026   2.65           Subordinated Notes             2023   3.10 We have entered into foreign exchange swap contracts to hedge the change in fair value attributable to foreign exchange movements in our foreign currency denominated investment securities and deposits.  These forward contracts convert the foreign currency risk to U.S. dollars, thereby mitigating our exposure to fluctuations in the fair value of the securities and deposits attributable to changes in foreign exchange rates.  Generally, no ineffectiveness is recorded in earnings, since the notional amount of the hedging instruments is aligned with the carrying value of the hedged securities and deposits.  The forward points on the hedging instruments are considered to be a hedging cost, and accordingly are excluded from the evaluation of hedge effectiveness and recorded in NII. Changes in the fair value of a derivative that are highly effective, and that are designated and qualify as a foreign currency hedge, are recorded in processing fees and other revenue. Cash Flow Hedges Derivatives categorized as cash flow hedges are utilized to offset the variability of cash flows to be received from or paid on a floating-rate asset or liability.  Ineffectiveness of cash flow hedges is defined as the extent to which the changes in fair value of the derivative exceed the changes in the present value of the forecasted cash flows attributable to the forecasted transaction. We have entered into foreign exchange contracts to hedge the change in cash flows attributable to foreign exchange movements in foreign currency denominated investment securities.  These foreign exchange contracts convert the foreign currency risk to U.S. dollars, thereby mitigating our exposure to fluctuations in the cash flows of the securities attributable to changes in foreign exchange rates.  Generally, no ineffectiveness is recorded in earnings, since the critical terms of the hedging instruments and the hedged securities are aligned.  Changes in the fair value of the derivative that are highly effective, and that are designated and qualify as a foreign currency hedge, are recorded in other comprehensive income. We have entered into an interest rate swap agreement to hedge the forecasted cash flows associated with LIBOR-indexed floating-rate loans.  The interest rate swaps synthetically convert the loan interest receipts from a variable-rate to a fixed-rate, thereby mitigating the risk attributable to changes in the LIBOR benchmark rate.  As of December 31, 2017, the maximum maturity date of the underlying loans is approximately 4.9 years. Net Investment Hedges We have entered into foreign exchange contracts to protect the net investment in our foreign operations against adverse changes in exchange rates.  These forward contracts convert the foreign currency risk to U.S. dollars, thereby mitigating our exposure to fluctuations in the fair value of our net investments in our foreign operations attributable to changes in foreign exchange rates.  The changes in fair value of the foreign exchange forward contracts are recorded, net of taxes, in the foreign currency translation component of other comprehensive income.  Effectiveness of net investment hedges is based on the overall changes in the fair value of the forward contracts and we measure the ineffectiveness of net investment hedge based on changes in forward foreign currency rates. There was no ineffectiveness for our net investment hedge during 2017.

Offsetting Arrangements We manage credit and counterparty risk by entering into enforceable netting agreements and other collateral arrangements with counterparties to derivative contracts and secured financing transactions, including resale and repurchase agreements, and principal securities borrowing and lending agreements.  These netting agreements mitigate our counterparty credit risk by providing for a single net settlement with a counterparty of all financial transactions covered by the agreement in an event of default as defined under such agreement.  In limited cases, a netting agreement may also provide for the periodic netting of settlement payments with respect to multiple different transaction types in the normal course of business.  Certain of our derivative contracts are executed under either standardized netting agreements or, for exchange-traded derivatives, the relevant contracts for a particular exchange which contain enforceable netting provisions.  In certain cases, we may have cross-product netting arrangements which allow for netting and set-off of a variety of types of derivatives with a single counterparty.  A derivative netting arrangement creates an enforceable right of set-off that becomes effective, and effects the realization or settlement of individual financial assets and liabilities, only following a specified event of default.  Collateral requirements associated with our derivative contracts are determined after a review of the creditworthiness of each counterparty, and the requirements are monitored and adjusted daily, typically based on net exposure by counterparty.  Collateral is generally in the form of cash or highly liquid U.S. government securities. In connection with secured financing transactions, we enter into netting agreements and other collateral arrangements with counterparties, which provide for the right to liquidate collateral in the event of default.  Collateral is generally required in the form of cash, equity securities or fixed-income securities.  Default events may include the failure to make payments or deliver securities timely, material adverse changes in financial condition or insolvency, the breach of minimum regulatory capital requirements, or loss of license, charter or other legal authorization necessary to perform under the contract. In order for an arrangement to be eligible for netting, we must have a reasonable basis to conclude that such netting arrangements are legally enforceable.  The analysis of the legal enforceability of an arrangement differs by jurisdiction, depending on the laws of that jurisdiction.  In many jurisdictions, specific legislation exists that provides for the enforceability in bankruptcy of close-out netting under a netting agreement, typically by way of specific exception from more general prohibitions on the exercise of creditor rights. When we have a legally enforceable netting arrangement between us and the derivative counterparty and the relevant transaction is the type of transaction that is recorded in our consolidated statement of condition, we offset derivative assets and liabilities, and the related collateral received and provided, in our consolidated statement of condition.  We also offset assets and liabilities related to secured financing transactions with the same counterparty or clearinghouse which have the same maturity date and are settled in the normal course of business on a net basis. Collateral that we receive in the form of securities in connection with secured financing transactions and derivative contracts can be transferred or re-pledged as collateral in many instances to enter into repurchase agreements or securities finance or derivative transactions.  The securities collateral received in connection with our securities finance activities is recorded at fair value in other assets in our consolidated statement of condition, with a related liability to return the collateral, if we have the right to transfer or re-pledge the collateral.  As of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, the fair value of securities received as collateral from third parties where we are permitted to transfer or re-pledge the securities totaled $2.47 billion and $1.77 billion, respectively, and the fair value of the portion that had been transferred or re-pledged as of the same dates was $15 million and $166 million, respectively.

NA  Not applicable State Street Corporation | 162 Table of Contents STATE STREET CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The securities transferred under resale and repurchase agreements typically are U.S. Treasury, agency and agency MBS.  In our principal securities borrowing and lending arrangements, the securities transferred are predominantly equity securities and some corporate debt securities.  The fair value of the securities transferred may increase in value to an amount greater than the amount received under our repurchase and securities lending arrangements, which exposes the Company with counterparty risk.  We require the review of the price of the underlying securities in relation to the carrying value of the repurchase agreements and securities lending arrangements on a daily basis and when appropriate, adjust the cash or security to be obtained or returned to counterparties that is reflective of the required collateral levels.

Commitments and Guarantees The following table presents the aggregate gross contractual amounts of our off-balance sheet commitments and off-balance sheet guarantees as of the dates indicated. (In millions) December 31, 2017   December 31, 2016 Commitments:       Unfunded credit facilities $ 26,488     $ 26,993           Guarantees(1):       Indemnified securities financing $ 381,817     $ 360,452   Stable value protection 26,653     27,182   Standby letters of credit 3,158     3,459 (1)  The potential losses associated with these guarantees equal the gross contractual amounts and do not consider the value of any collateral or reflect any participations to independent third parties. Unfunded Credit Facilities Unfunded credit facilities consist of liquidity facilities for our fund and municipal lending clients and undrawn lines of credit related to senior secured bank loans. As of December 31, 2017, approximately 72% of our unfunded commitments to extend credit expire within one year.  Since many of these commitments are expected to expire or renew without being drawn upon, the gross contractual amounts do not necessarily represent our future cash requirements. Indemnified Securities Financing On behalf of our clients, we lend their securities, as agent, to brokers and other institutions.  In most circumstances, we indemnify our clients for the fair market value of those securities against a failure of the borrower to return such securities.  We require the borrowers to maintain collateral in an amount in excess of 100% of the fair market value of the securities borrowed.  Securities on loan and the collateral are revalued daily to determine if additional collateral is necessary or if excess collateral is required to be returned to the borrower.  Collateral received in connection with our securities lending services is held by us as agent and is not recorded in our consolidated statement of condition. The cash collateral held by us as agent is invested on behalf of our clients.  In certain cases, the cash collateral is invested in third-party repurchase agreements, for which we indemnify the client against loss of the principal invested.  We require the counterparty to the indemnified repurchase agreement to provide collateral in an amount in excess of 100% of the amount of the repurchase agreement.  In our role as agent, the indemnified repurchase agreements and the related collateral held by us are not recorded in our consolidated statement of condition. The following table summarizes the aggregate fair values of indemnified securities financing and related collateral, as well as collateral invested in indemnified repurchase agreements, as of the dates indicated: (In millions) December 31, 2017   December 31, 2016 Fair value of indemnified securities financing $ 381,817     $ 360,452   Fair value of cash and securities held by us, as agent, as collateral for indemnified securities financing 400,828     377,919   Fair value of collateral for indemnified securities financing invested in indemnified repurchase agreements 61,270     60,003   Fair value of cash and securities held by us or our agents as collateral for investments in indemnified repurchase agreements 65,272     63,959 In certain cases, we participate in securities finance transactions as a principal.  As a principal, we borrow securities from the lending client and then lend such securities to the subsequent borrower, either a State Street client or a broker/dealer.  Our right to receive and obligation to return collateral in connection with our securities lending transactions are recorded in other assets and other liabilities, respectively, in our consolidated statement of condition.  As of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, we had approximately $19.40 billion and $21.20 billion, respectively, of collateral provided and approximately $3.85 billion and $5.02 billion, respectively, of collateral received from clients in connection with our participation in principal securities finance transactions. Stable Value Protection In the normal course of our business, we offer products that provide book-value protection, primarily to plan participants in stable value funds managed by non-affiliated investment managers of post-retirement defined contribution benefit plans, particularly 401(k) plans.  The book-value protection is provided on portfolios of intermediate investment grade fixed-income securities, and is intended to provide safety and stable growth of principal invested.  The protection is intended to cover any shortfall in the event that a significant number of plan participants withdraw funds when book value exceeds market value and the liquidation of the assets is not sufficient to redeem the participants.  The investment parameters of the underlying portfolios, combined with structural protections, are designed to provide cushion and guard against payments even under extreme stress scenarios. State Street Corporation | 164 Table of Contents STATE STREET CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS These contingencies are individually accounted for as derivative financial instruments.  The notional amounts of the stable value contracts are presented as ""derivatives not designated as hedging instruments"" in the table of aggregate notional amounts of derivative financial instruments provided in Note 10.  We have not made a payment under these contingencies that we consider material to our consolidated financial condition, and management believes that the probability of payment under these contingencies in the future, that we would consider material to our consolidated financial condition, is remote. Standby Letters of Credit Standby letters of credit provide credit enhancement to our municipal clients to support the issuance of capital markets financing. Note 13.    Contingencies Legal and Regulatory Matters In the ordinary course of business, we and our subsidiaries are involved in disputes, litigation, and governmental or regulatory inquiries and investigations, both pending and threatened. These matters, if resolved adversely against us or settled, may result in monetary damages, fines and penalties or require changes in our business practices. The resolution or settlement of these matters is inherently difficult to predict. Based on our assessment of these pending matters, we do not believe that the amount of any judgment, settlement or other action arising from any pending matter is likely to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition. However, an adverse outcome in certain of the matters described below could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations for the period in which such matter is resolved, or an accrual is determined to be required, on our consolidated financial condition, or on our reputation. We evaluate our needs for accruals of loss contingencies related to legal and regulatory proceedings on a case-by-case basis. When we have a liability that we deem probable, and we deem the amount of such liability can be reasonably estimated as of the date of our consolidated financial statements, we accrue our estimate of the amount of loss. We also consider a loss probable and establish an accrual when we make, or intend to make, an offer of settlement. Once established, an accrual is subject to subsequent adjustment as a result of additional information. The resolution of legal and regulatory proceedings and the amount of reasonably estimable loss (or range thereof) are inherently difficult to predict, especially in the early stages of proceedings. Even if a loss is probable, an amount (or range) of loss might not be reasonably estimated until the later stages of the proceeding due to many factors such as the presence of complex or novel legal theories, the discretion of governmental authorities in seeking sanctions or negotiating resolutions in civil and criminal matters, the pace and timing of discovery and other assessments of facts and the procedural posture of the matter (collectively, ""factors influencing reasonable estimates""). As of December 31, 2017, our aggregate accruals for loss contingencies for legal and regulatory matters totaled approximately $12 million.  To the extent that we have established accruals in our consolidated statement of condition for probable loss contingencies, such accruals may not be sufficient to cover our ultimate financial exposure associated with any settlements or judgments. Any such ultimate financial exposure, or proceedings to which we may become subject in the future, could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, on our future consolidated financial statements or on our reputation. Except where otherwise noted below, we have not established significant accruals with respect to the claims discussed. We have identified certain matters for which loss is reasonably possible (but not probable) in future periods, whether in excess of an accrued liability or where there is no accrued liability, and for which we are able to estimate a range of reasonably possible loss.  As of December 31, 2017, our estimate of the range of reasonably possible loss for these matters is from zero to approximately $15 million in the aggregate. Our estimate with respect to the aggregate range of reasonably possible loss is based upon currently available information and is subject to significant judgment and a variety of assumptions and known and unknown uncertainties. The matters underlying the estimated range will change from time to time, and actual results may vary significantly from the current estimate. In certain other pending matters, including the invoicing matter, Federal Reserve/Massachusetts Division of Banks written agreement and shareholder litigation matters discussed below, it is not currently feasible to reasonably estimate the amount or a range of reasonably possible loss (including reasonably possible loss in excess of amounts accrued), and such losses, which may be significant, are not included in the estimate of reasonably possible loss discussed above. This is due to, among other factors, the factors influencing reasonable estimates described above. These factors are particularly prevalent in governmental and regulatory inquiries and investigations.  As a result, reasonably possible loss estimates often are not feasible until the later stages of the inquiry or investigation or of any related legal or regulatory proceeding. An adverse State Street Corporation | 165 Table of Contents STATE STREET CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS outcome in one or more of the matters for which we have not estimated the amount or a range of reasonably possible loss, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, on our future consolidated financial statements or on our reputation. Given that we cannot estimate reasonably possible loss for all legal and regulatory proceedings as to which we may be subject now or in the future, including matters that if adversely concluded may present material financial, regulatory and reputational risks, no conclusion as to the ultimate exposure from current pending or potential legal or regulatory proceedings should be drawn from the current estimate of reasonably possible loss. The following discussion provides information with respect to significant legal, governmental and regulatory matters. Invoicing Matter In December 2015, we announced a review of the manner in which we invoiced certain expenses to some of our Investment Servicing clients, primarily in the United States, during an 18-year period going back to 1998, and our determination that we had incorrectly invoiced clients for certain expenses. We informed our clients in December 2015 that we will pay to them the amounts we concluded were incorrectly invoiced to them, plus interest.  We are implementing enhancements to our billing processes, and we are reviewing the conduct of our employees and have taken appropriate steps to address conduct inconsistent with our standards, including, in some cases, termination of employment. In connection with our enhancements to our billing processes, we continue to review historical billing practices and may from time to time identify additional remediation. We currently expect the cumulative total of our payments to customers for these matters to be at least $360 million. We have received a purported class action demand letter alleging that our invoicing practices were unfair and deceptive under Massachusetts law. A class of customers, or particular customers, may assert that we have not paid to them all amounts incorrectly invoiced, and may seek double or treble damages under Massachusetts law. In addition, in March 2017, a purported class action was commenced against us alleging that our invoicing practices violated duties owed to retirement plan customers under ERISA. We are also responding to requests for information from, and are cooperating with investigations by, governmental and regulatory authorities on these matters, including the civil and criminal divisions of the DOJ, the SEC, the DOL, the Massachusetts Attorney General, and the New Hampshire Bureau of Securities Regulation, which could result in significant fines or other sanctions, civil and criminal, against us. If these governmental or regulatory authorities were to conclude that all or a portion of the billing errors merited civil or criminal sanctions, any fine or other penalty could be a significant percentage, or a multiple of, the portion of the overcharging serving as the basis of such a claim or of the full amount overcharged. The governmental and regulatory authorities have significant discretion in civil and criminal matters as to the fines and other penalties they may seek to impose. The severity of such fines or other  penalties could take into account factors such as the amount and duration of our incorrect invoicing, the government's or regulator's assessment of the conduct of our employees, as well as prior conduct such as that which resulted in our January 2017 deferred prosecution agreement in connection with transition management services and our recent settlement of civil claims regarding our indirect foreign exchange business. The outcome of any of these proceedings and, in particular, any criminal sanction could materially adversely affect our results of operations and could have significant collateral consequences for our business and reputation. Federal Reserve/Massachusetts Division of Banks Written Agreement On June 1, 2015, we entered into a written agreement with the Federal Reserve and the Massachusetts Division of Banks relating to deficiencies identified in our compliance programs with the requirements of the Bank Secrecy Act, AML regulations and U.S. economic sanctions regulations promulgated by OFAC.  As part of this enforcement action, we have been required to, among other things, implement improvements to our compliance programs and to retain an independent firm to conduct a review of account and transaction activity to evaluate whether any suspicious activity was not previously reported. If we fail to comply with the terms of the written agreement, we may become subject to fines and other regulatory sanctions, which may have a material adverse effect on us. Shareholder Litigation A State Street shareholder has filed a purported class action complaint against the Company alleging that the Company's financial statements in its annual reports for the 2011-2014 period were misleading due to the inclusion of revenues associated with the invoicing matter referenced above and the facts surrounding our 2017 settlements with the U.S. government relating to our transition management business. In addition, a State Street shareholder has filed a derivative complaint against the Company's past and present officers and directors to recover State Street Corporation | 166 Table of Contents STATE STREET CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS alleged losses incurred by the Company relating to the invoicing matter and to our Ohio public retirement plans matter. Income Taxes In determining our provision for income taxes, we make certain judgments and interpretations with respect to tax laws in jurisdictions in which we have business operations.  Because of the complex nature of these laws, in the normal course of our business, we are subject to challenges from U.S. and non-U.S. income tax authorities regarding the amount of income taxes due.  These challenges may result in adjustments to the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions or the allocation of taxable income among tax jurisdictions.  We recognize a tax benefit when it is more likely than not that our position will result in a tax deduction or credit.  Additional information with respect to our provision for income taxes and tax benefits, including unrecognized tax benefits, is provided in Note 22. We are presently under audit by a number of tax authorities, and the Internal Revenue Service is currently reviewing our U.S. income tax returns for the tax years 2014 and 2015.  The earliest tax year open to examination in jurisdictions where we have material operations is 2011.  Management believes that we have sufficiently accrued liabilities as of December 31, 2017 for tax exposures. Note 14.    Variable Interest Entities We are involved, in the normal course of our business, with various types of special purpose entities, some of which meet the definition of VIEs. When evaluating a VIE for consolidation, we must determine whether or not we have a variable interest in the entity. Variable interests are investments or other interests that absorb portions of an entity's expected losses or receive portions of the entity's expected returns. If it is determined that State Street does not have a variable interest in the VIE, no further analysis is required and State Street does not consolidate the VIE.  If State Street holds a variable interest in a VIE, we are required by U.S. GAAP to consolidate that VIE when we have a controlling financial interest in the VIE and therefore are deemed to be the primary beneficiary.  State Street is determined to have a controlling financial interest in a VIE when it has both the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE's economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits of the VIE that could potentially be significant to that VIE. This determination is evaluated periodically as facts and circumstances change. Asset-Backed Investment Securities We invest in various forms of ABS, which we carry in our investment securities portfolio.  These ABS meet the U.S. GAAP definition of asset securitization entities, which are considered to be VIEs.  We are not considered to be the primary beneficiary of these VIEs since we do not have control over their activities.  Additional information about our ABS is provided in Note 3. Tax-Exempt Investment Program In the normal course of our business, we structure and sell certificated interests in pools of tax-exempt investment-grade assets, principally to our mutual fund clients.  We structure these pools as partnership trusts, and the assets and liabilities of the trusts are recorded in our consolidated statement of condition as AFS investment securities and other short-term borrowings.  As of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, we carried AFS investment securities, composed of securities related to state and political subdivisions, with a fair value of $1.25 billion and $1.35 billion, respectively, and other short-term borrowings of $1.08 billion and $1.16 billion, respectively, in our consolidated statement of condition in connection with these trusts.  The interest income and interest expense generated by the investments and certificated interests, respectively, are recorded as components of NII when earned or incurred. We transfer assets to the trusts from our investment securities portfolio at adjusted book value, and the trusts finance the acquisition of these assets by selling certificated interests issued by the trust to third-party investors and to State Street as residual holder.  These transfers do not meet the de-recognition criteria defined by U.S. GAAP, and therefore, the assets continue to be recorded in our consolidated financial statements.  The trusts had a weighted-average life of approximately 4.6 years as of December 31, 2017, compared to approximately 4.5 years as of December 31, 2016. Under separate legal agreements, we provide liquidity facilities to these trusts and, with respect to certain securities, letters of credit.  As of December 31, 2017, our commitments to the trusts under these liquidity facilities and letters of credit totaled $1.10 billion and $351 million, respectively, and none of the liquidity facilities or letters of credit, were utilized.  In the event that our obligations under these liquidity facilities are triggered, no material impact to our consolidated results of operations or financial condition is expected to occur, because the securities are already recorded at fair value in our consolidated statement of condition.  In addition, neither creditors or third-party investors in the trusts have any recourse to State Street's general credit other than through the liquidity facilities and letters of credit noted above. State Street Corporation | 167 Table of Contents STATE STREET CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Interests in Investment Funds In the normal course of business, we manage various types of investment funds through SSGA in which our clients are investors, including SSGA commingled investment vehicles and other similar investment structures.  The majority of our AUM are contained within such funds.  The services we provide to these funds generate management fee revenue.  From time to time, we may invest cash in the funds in order for the funds to establish a performance history for newly-launched strategies, referred to as seed capital, or for other purposes. With respect to our interests in funds that meet the definition of a VIE, a primary beneficiary assessment is performed to determine if we have a controlling financial interest.  As part of our assessment, we consider all the facts and circumstances regarding the terms and characteristics of the variable interest(s), the design and characteristics of the fund and the other involvements of the enterprise with the fund.  Upon consolidation of certain funds, we retain the specialized investment company accounting rules followed by the underlying funds. All of the underlying investments held by such consolidated funds are carried at fair value, with corresponding changes in the investments' fair values reflected in trading services revenue in our consolidated statement of income. When we no longer control these funds due to a reduced ownership interest or other reasons, the funds are de-consolidated and accounted for under another accounting method if we continue to maintain investments in the funds. As of December 31, 2017, the aggregate assets and liabilities of our consolidated sponsored investment funds totaled $149 million and $50 million, respectively.  As of December 31, 2016, we had no consolidated funds. As of December 31, 2017, our potential maximum total exposure associated with the consolidated sponsored investment funds totaled $100 million and represented the value of our economic ownership interest in the funds. Our conclusion to consolidate a fund may vary from period to period, most commonly as a result of fluctuation in our ownership interest as a result of changes in the number of fund shares held by either us or by third parties.  Given that the funds follow specialized investment company accounting rules which prescribe fair value, a de-consolidation generally would not result in gains or losses for us. The net assets of any consolidated fund are solely available to settle the liabilities of the fund and to settle any investors' ownership redemption requests, including any seed capital invested in the fund by State Street.  We are not contractually required to provide financial or any other support to any of our funds.  In addition, neither creditors nor equity investors in the funds have any recourse to State Street's general credit. As of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, we managed certain funds, considered VIEs, in which we held a variable interest but for which we were not deemed to be the primary beneficiary.  Our potential maximum loss exposure related to these unconsolidated funds totaled $72 million and $121 million as of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively, and represented the carrying value of our investments, which are recorded in either AFS investment securities or other assets in our consolidated statement of condition.  The amount of loss we may recognize during any period is limited to the carrying amount of our investments in the unconsolidated funds.

Regulatory Capital We are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by federal banking agencies.  Failure to meet minimum regulatory capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on our consolidated financial condition.  Under current regulatory capital adequacy guidelines, we must meet specified capital requirements that involve quantitative measures of our consolidated assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet exposures calculated in conformity with regulatory accounting practices. Our capital components and their classifications are subject to qualitative judgments by regulators about components, risk weightings and other factors. As required by the Dodd-Frank Act, State Street and State Street Bank, as advanced approaches banking organizations, are subject to a permanent ""capital floor"" in the calculation and assessment of their regulatory capital adequacy by U.S. banking regulators.  Beginning on January 1, 2015, we were required to calculate our risk-based capital ratios using both the advanced approaches and the standardized approach.  As a result, from January 1, 2015 going forward, our risk-based capital ratios for regulatory assessment purposes are the lower of each ratio calculated under the standardized approach and the advanced approaches. The methods for the calculation of our and State Street Bank's risk-based capital ratios will change as the provisions of the Basel III final rule related to the numerator (capital) and denominator (risk-weighted assets) are phased in, and as we begin calculating our risk-weighted assets using the advanced approaches.  These ongoing methodological changes will result in differences in our reported capital ratios from one reporting period to the next that are independent of applicable changes to our capital base, our asset composition, our off-balance sheet exposures or our risk profile. As of December 31, 2017, State Street and State Street Bank exceeded all regulatory capital adequacy requirements to which they were subject.  As of December 31, 2017, State Street Bank was categorized as ""well capitalized"" under the applicable regulatory capital adequacy framework, and exceeded all ""well capitalized"" ratio guidelines to which it was subject.  Management believes that no conditions or events have occurred since December 31, 2017 that have changed the capital categorization of State Street Bank. The following table presents the regulatory capital structure, total risk-weighted assets, related regulatory capital ratios and the minimum required regulatory capital ratios for State Street and State Street Bank as of the dates indicated.  As a result of changes in the methodologies used to calculate our regulatory capital ratios from period to period as the provisions of the Basel III final rule are phased in, the ratios presented in the table for each period-end are not directly comparable.

(2) CET1 capital, tier 1 capital and total capital ratios as of December 31, 2017  and December 31, 2016 were calculated in conformity with the standardized approach provisions of the Basel III final rule.  Tier 1 leverage ratio as of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 were calculated in conformity with the Basel III final rule. (3) Amounts for State Street and State Street Bank as of December 31, 2017 consisted of goodwill, net of associated deferred tax liabilities, and 80% of other intangible assets, net of associated deferred tax liabilities. Amounts for State Street and State Street Bank as of December 31, 2016 consisted of goodwill, net of deferred tax liabilities and 60% of other intangible assets, net of associated deferred tax liabilities.  Intangible assets, net of associated deferred tax liabilities is phased in as a deduction from capital, in conformity with the Basel III final rule. (4) Under the current advanced approaches rules and regulatory guidance concerning operational risk models, RWA attributable to operational risk can vary substantially from period-to-period, without direct correlation to the effects of a particular loss event on our results of operations and financial condition and impacting dates and periods that may differ from the dates and periods as of and during which the loss event is reflected in our financial statements, with the timing and categorization dependent on the processes for model updates and, if applicable, model revalidation and regulatory review and related supervisory processes.  An individual loss event can have a significant effect on the output of our operational risk RWA under the advanced approaches depending on the severity of the loss event and its categorization among the seven Basel-defined UOMs. (5) Market risk risk-weighted assets reported in conformity with the Basel III advanced approaches included a CVA which reflected the risk of potential fair value adjustments for credit risk reflected in our valuation of over-the-counter derivative contracts.  The CVA was not provided for in the final market risk capital rule; however, it was required by the advanced approaches provisions of the Basel III final rule.  We used a simple CVA approach in conformity with the Basel III advanced approaches. (6) Minimum requirements will be phased in up to full implementation beginning on January 1, 2019; minimum requirements listed are as of December 31, 2017. (7) Minimum requirements will be phased in up to full implementation beginning on January 1, 2019; minimum requirements listed are as of December 31, 2016.

Equity-Based Compensation We record compensation expense for equity-based awards, such as restricted stock, deferred stock and performance awards, based on the closing price of our common stock on the date of grant, adjusted if appropriate based on the award's eligibility to receive dividends.  The fair value of stock appreciation rights are determined using the Black-Scholes valuation model. Compensation expense related to equity-based awards with service-only conditions and terms that provide for a graded vesting schedule is recognized on a straight-line basis over the required service period for the entire award.  Compensation expense related to equity-based awards with performance conditions and terms that provide for a graded vesting schedule is recognized over the requisite service period for each separately vesting tranche of the award, and is based on the probable outcome of the performance conditions at each reporting date. Compensation expense is adjusted for assumptions with respect to the estimated amount of awards that will be forfeited prior to vesting, and for employees who have met certain retirement eligibility criteria. Compensation expense for common stock awards granted to employees meeting early retirement eligibility criteria is fully expensed on the grant date. Dividend equivalents for certain equity-based awards are paid on stock units on a current basis prior to vesting and distribution. The 2017 Stock Incentive Plan, or 2017 Plan, was approved by shareholders in May 2017 for issuance of stock and stock based awards.  Awards may be made under the 2017 Plan for (i) up to 8.3 million shares of common stock plus (ii) up to an additional 28.5 million shares that were available to be issued under the 2006 Equity Incentive Plan, or 2006 Plan, or may become available for issuance under the 2006 Plan due to expiration, termination, cancellation, forfeiture or repurchase of awards granted under the 2006 Plan.  As of December 31, 2017, a total of 17.9 million shares from the 2006 Plan have been added to and may be issued from the 2017 Plan.  As of December 31, 2017, a cumulative total of 0.4 million shares had been awarded under the 2017 Plan and 68.9 million had been awarded under the 2006 Plan.  As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, we had cumulative totals of 65.7 million shares and 60.9 million shares, respectively, awarded under the 2006 Plan.  The 2017 Plan allows for shares withheld in payment of the exercise price of an award or in satisfaction of tax withholding requirements, shares forfeited due to employee termination, shares expired under options awards, or shares not delivered when performance conditions have not been met, to be added back to the pool of shares available for issuance under the 2017 Plan.  From inception to December 31, 2017, fewer than 1 million shares had been awarded under the 2017 Plan but not delivered, and have become available for reissue.  As of December 31, 2017, a total of 25.9 million shares were available for future issuance under the 2017 Plan. The exercise price of non-qualified and incentive stock options and stock appreciation rights may not be less than the fair value of such shares on the date of grant. Stock options and stock appreciation rights granted under the 1997 Equity Incentive Plan, or 1997 Plan, and the 2006 Plan, collectively the Plans, generally vest over four years and expire no later than ten years from the date of grant. No common stock options or stock appreciation rights have been granted since 2009.  For restricted stock awards granted under the Plans, common stock is issued at the time of grant and recipients have dividend and voting rights.  In general, these grants vest over three to four years.  As of December 31, 2017 there are no outstanding stock options or restricted stock awards. For deferred stock awards granted under the Plans, no common stock is issued at the time of grant and the award does not possess dividend and voting rights.  Generally, these grants vest over one to four years.  Performance awards granted are earned over a performance period based on the achievement of State Street Corporation | 173 Table of Contents STATE STREET CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS defined goals, generally over three years.  Payment for performance awards is made in shares of our common stock equal to its fair market value per share, based on the performance of certain financial ratios, after the conclusion of each performance period. Beginning with 2012, malus-based forfeiture provisions were included in deferred stock awards granted to employees identified as ""material risk-takers,"" as defined by management.  These malus-based forfeiture provisions provide for the reduction or cancellation of unvested deferred compensation, such as deferred stock awards and performance based awards, if it is determined that a material risk-taker made risk-based decisions that exposed State Street to inappropriate risks that resulted in a material unexpected loss at the business-unit, line-of-business or corporate level.  In addition, awards granted to certain of our senior executives, as well as awards granted to individuals in certain jurisdictions, may be subject to recoupment after vesting (if applicable) and delivery to the individual in specified circumstances generally relating to fraud or willful misconduct by the individual that results in material harm to us or a material financial restatement. Compensation expense related to stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock awards, deferred stock awards and performance awards, which we record as a component of compensation and employee benefits expense in our consolidated statement of income, was $243 million, $268 million and $319 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  Such expense for 2017, 2016 and 2015 excluded $15 million, $9 million and $10 million, respectively, associated with acceleration of expense in connection with targeted staff reductions. This expense was included in the severance-related portion of the associated restructuring charges recorded in each respective year.

We utilize either treasury shares or authorized but unissued shares to satisfy the issuance of common stock under our equity incentive plans. We do not have a specific policy concerning purchases of our common stock to satisfy stock issuances, including exercises of stock options. We have a general policy concerning purchases of our common stock to meet issuances under our employee benefit plans, including option exercises and other corporate purposes. Various factors determine the amount and timing of our purchases of our common stock, including regulatory reviews and approvals or non-objections, our regulatory capital requirements, the number of shares we expect to issue under employee benefit plans, market conditions (including the trading price of our common stock), and legal considerations. These factors can change at any time, and the number of shares of common stock we will purchase or when we will purchase them cannot be assured. See Note 15 for further information on our common stock purchase program. Note 19.    Employee Benefits Defined Benefit Pension and Other Post-Retirement Benefit Plans State Street Bank and certain of its U.S. subsidiaries participate in a non-contributory, tax-qualified defined benefit pension plan.  The U.S. defined benefit pension plan was frozen as of December 31, 2007 and no new employees were eligible to participate after that date.  State Street has agreed to contribute sufficient amounts as necessary to meet the benefits paid to plan participants and to fund the plan's service cost, plus interest. U.S. employee account balances earn annual interest credits until the employee begins receiving benefits.  Non-U.S. employees participate in local defined benefit plans which are funded as required in each local jurisdiction.  In addition to the defined benefit pension plans, we have non-qualified unfunded SERPs that provide certain officers with defined pension benefits in excess of allowable qualified plan limits.  State Street Bank and certain of its U.S. subsidiaries also participate in a post-retirement plan that provides health care benefits for certain retired employees.  The total expense for these tax-qualified and non-qualified plans was $15 million, $16 million and $46 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. We recognize the funded status of our defined benefit pension plans and other post-retirement benefit plans, measured as the difference between the fair value of the plan assets and the projected benefit obligation, in the consolidated statement of position.  The assets held by the defined benefit pension plans are largely made up of common, collective funds that are liquid and invest principally in U.S. equities and high-quality fixed income investments.  The majority of these assets fall within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.  The benefit obligations associated with our primary U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit plans, non-qualified unfunded supplemental retirement plans and post-retirement plans were $1.32 billion, $125 million and $16 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2017 and $1.23 billion, $136 million and $21 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2016.  As the primary defined benefit plans are frozen, the benefit obligation will only vary over time as a result of changes in market interest rates, the life expectancy of the plan participants and payments made from the plans.  The primary U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans were underfunded by $9 million and $32 million as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.  The non-qualified supplemental retirement plans were underfunded by $125 million and $136 million as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.  The other post-retirement benefit plans were underfunded by $16 million and $21 million as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.  The underfunded status is included in other liabilities. Defined Contribution Retirement Plans We contribute to employer-sponsored U.S. and non-U.S. defined contribution plans. Our contribution to these plans was $146 million, $132 million, and $130 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. State Street Corporation | 175 Table of Contents STATE STREET CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Note 20.  Occupancy Expense and Information Systems and Communications Expense Occupancy expense and information systems and communications expense include depreciation of buildings, leasehold improvements, computer hardware and software, equipment, and furniture and fixtures.  Total depreciation expense in 2017, 2016 and 2015 was $526 million, $472 million and $443 million, respectively. We lease 1,025,000 square feet at One Lincoln Street, our headquarters building located in Boston, Massachusetts, and a related underground parking garage, under 20-year, non-cancelable capital leases expiring in September 2023.  A portion of the lease payments is offset by subleases for approximately 127,000 square feet of the building.  As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, an aggregate net book value of $159 million and $194 million, respectively, related to the above-described capital leases was recorded in premises and equipment, with the related liability recorded in long-term debt, in our consolidated statement of condition. Capital lease asset amortization is recorded in occupancy expense on a straight-line basis in our consolidated statement of income over the respective lease term. Lease payments are recorded as a reduction of the liability, with a portion recorded as imputed interest expense.  In 2017, 2016 and 2015, interest expense related to these capital lease obligations, reflected in NII, was $20 million, $22 million and $32 million, respectively.  As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, accumulated amortization of capital lease assets was $401 million and $365 million, respectively. We have entered into non-cancelable operating leases for premises and equipment.  Nearly all of these leases include renewal options.  Costs related to operating leases for office space are recorded in occupancy expense.  Costs related to operating leases for equipment are recorded in information systems and communications expense.  Both are recorded on a straight-line basis. Total rental expense net of sublease revenue in 2017, 2016 and 2015 amounted to $229 million, $194 million and $190 million, respectively.  Total rental expense was reduced by sublease revenue of $5 million in 2017 and $4 million in both 2016 and 2015. The following table presents a summary of future minimum lease payments under non-cancelable capital and operating leases as of December 31, 2017.  Aggregate future minimum rental commitments have been reduced by aggregate sublease rental commitments of $41 million for capital leases and $19 million for operating leases.

Income Taxes We use an asset-and-liability approach to account for income taxes.  Our objective is to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year through charges or credits to the current tax provision, and to recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for future tax consequences of temporary differences between amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and their respective tax bases.  The measurement of tax assets and liabilities is based on enacted tax laws and applicable tax rates.  The effects of a tax position on our consolidated financial statements are recognized when we believe it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained.  A valuation allowance is established if it is considered more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.  Deferred tax assets and liabilities recorded in our consolidated statement of condition are netted within the same tax jurisdiction. The following table presents the components of income tax expense (benefit) for the periods indicated: Years Ended December 31, (In millions) 2017   2016   2015 Current:           Federal $ 229     $ (14 )   $ 52   State 18     30     92   Non-U.S. 380     320     342   Total current expense 627     336     486   Deferred:           Federal 49     (311 )   (39 ) State 65     38     40   Non-U.S. (19 )   (85 )   (169 ) Total deferred expense (benefit) 95     (358 )   (168 ) Total income tax expense (benefit) $ 722     $ (22 )   $ 318 The following table presents a reconciliation of the U.S. statutory income tax rate to our effective tax rate based on income before income tax expense for the periods indicated: Years Ended December 31,   2017   2016   2015 U.S. federal income tax rate 35.0  %   35.0  %   35.0  % Changes from statutory rate:           State taxes, net of federal benefit 1.9     2.0     4.2   Tax-exempt income (4.5 )   (6.1 )   (5.6 ) Business tax credits(1) (6.8 )   (13.6 )   (9.4 ) Foreign tax differential (7.4 )   (7.7 )   (9.6 ) Transition tax 15.7      -       -    Deferred tax revaluation (6.8 )    -       -    Foreign designated earnings (0.7 )   (6.8 )    -    Foreign capital transactions  -      (4.3 )    -    Tax refund  -       -      (2.8 ) Litigation expense  -      1.4     2.7   Other, net (1.5 )   (0.9 )   (0.7 ) Effective tax rate 24.9  %   (1.0 )%   13.8  % (1) Business tax credits include low-income housing, production and investment tax credits. On December 22, 2017, the President signed into law the TCJA (H.R. 1), reducing the corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% and enacting a one-time transition tax on unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries.  Although we have not completed accounting for the tax effects of the TCJA, we included a provisional estimate for the impact to deferred tax balances and cost associated with the one-time transition tax. State Street Corporation | 177 Table of Contents STATE STREET CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS As a result of the reduction in the corporate income tax rate, certain U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities were revalued resulting in a provisional estimated deferred tax benefit of $197 million.  Deferred tax assets and liabilities represent the future impact on income taxes resulting from temporary differences that exist as of the balance sheet date using enacted tax rates.  Certain U.S. temporary differences are a provisional estimate based on information currently available.  As additional information is made available, there may be adjustments to temporary differences that could increase or decrease the deferred tax balances.  As such, the $197 million benefit may be adjusted in future periods. The one-time transition tax is measured on total post-1986 earnings and profits (""E&P"") of foreign subsidiaries previously deferred from U.S. income taxes.  Although we have not completed our analysis of cumulative E&P, we have included a provisional expense of $454 million based on information available and our current interpretations of the newly enacted law.  This amount is based on the amount of earnings held in cash and other specified assets.  We understand that this amount will change as estimates of foreign E&P and foreign income taxes are refined and assumptions are modified from additional guidance on the TCJA. The 2016 foreign designated earnings include the benefits attributable to the change in designation of certain of our foreign earnings as indefinitely invested overseas.  The foreign capital transactions include the tax benefits from incremental foreign tax credits and a foreign affiliate tax loss.  The increase in business tax credits is attributable to an increase in alternative energy investments. In 2015 we recognized benefits associated with the reduction of an Italian deferred tax liability and the approval of a tax refund for prior years, partially offset by a change in New York tax law. The following table presents significant components of our gross deferred tax assets and gross deferred tax liabilities as of the dates indicated: December 31, (In millions) 2017   2016 Deferred tax assets:       Unrealized losses on investment securities, net $ 17     $ 157   Deferred compensation 159     285   Defined benefit pension plan 82     116   Restructuring charges and other reserves 132     199   Foreign currency translation 18     225   General business credit 231     425   NOL and other carryforwards 101     73   Other 27     32   Total deferred tax assets 767     1,512   Valuation allowance for deferred tax assets (88 )   (66 ) Deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowance $ 679     $ 1,446   Deferred tax liabilities:       Leveraged lease financing  $ 184     $ 313   Fixed and intangible assets 755     886   Non-U.S. earnings 6     164   Investment basis differences 158     120   Total deferred tax liabilities $ 1,103     $ 1,483 The reduction in deferred tax assets and liabilities includes the provisional estimated impact of TCJA as well as current year activity such as the utilization of General Business Credits, additional investments in tax advantaged investments and changes in FX rates. The table below summarizes the deferred tax assets and related valuation allowances recognized as of December 31, 2017: (In millions) Deferred Tax Asset   Valuation Allowance   Expiration General business Credits $ 231     $  -      2035-2037 NOLs - Non-U.S. 47     (35 )   2018-2026 / None Other Carryforwards 41     (41 )   None NOLs - State 13     (12 )   2018-2036 Management considers the valuation allowance adequate to reduce the total deferred tax assets to an aggregate amount that will more likely than not be realized.  Management has determined that a valuation allowance is not required for the remaining deferred tax assets because it is more likely than not that there is sufficient taxable income of the appropriate nature within the carryforward periods to realize these assets. State Street Corporation | 178 Table of Contents STATE STREET CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS At December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, the gross unrecognized tax benefits, excluding interest, were $94 million, $71 million, and $63 million, respectively.  Of this, the amounts that would reduce the effective tax rate, if recognized, are $87 million, $63 million and $55 million, respectively.  Unrecognized tax benefits do not include the benefit of the federal deduction for unrecognized state tax benefits which is included in the effective tax rate. The following table presents activity related to unrecognized tax benefits as of the dates indicated: December 31, (In millions) 2017   2016   2015 Beginning balance $ 71     $ 63     $ 163   Decrease related to agreements with tax authorities (14 )   (13 )   (122 ) Increase related to tax positions taken during current year 26     7     8   Increase related to tax positions taken during prior years 11     14     14   Ending balance $ 94     $ 71     $ 63 It is reasonably possible that of the $94 million of unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2017, up to $14 million could decrease within the next 12 months due to the resolution of various audits. Management believes that we have sufficient accrued liabilities as of December 31, 2017 for tax exposures and related interest expense. Income tax expense included related interest and penalties of approximately $3 million and $2 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively. Total accrued interest and penalties are approximately $8 million, $5 million and $3 million as of December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Note 23.    Earnings Per Common Share Basic EPS is calculated pursuant to the ""two-class"" method, by dividing net income available to common shareholders by the weighted-average common shares outstanding during the period.  Diluted EPS is calculated pursuant to the two-class method, by dividing net income available to common shareholders by the total weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period plus the shares representing the dilutive effect of equity-based awards.  The effect of equity-based awards is excluded from the calculation of diluted EPS in periods in which their effect would be anti-dilutive. The two-class method requires the allocation of undistributed net income between common and participating shareholders.  Net income available to common shareholders, presented separately in our consolidated statement of income, is the basis for the calculation of both basic and diluted EPS.   Participating securities are composed of unvested and fully vested SERP shares and fully vested deferred director stock awards, which are equity-based awards that contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends, and are considered to participate with the common stock in undistributed earnings. The following table presents the computation of basic and diluted earnings per common share for the periods indicated: Years Ended December 31, (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) 2017   2016   2015 Net income $ 2,177     $ 2,143     $ 1,980   Less:           Preferred stock dividends  (182 )   (173 )   (130 ) Dividends and undistributed earnings allocated to participating securities(1) (2 )   (2 )   (2 ) Net income available to common shareholders $ 1,993     $ 1,968     $ 1,848   Average common shares outstanding (In thousands):           Basic average common shares 374,793     391,485     407,856   Effect of dilutive securities: equity-based awards 5,420     4,605     5,782   Diluted average common shares 380,213     396,090     413,638   Anti-dilutive securities(2) 188     2,143     661   Earnings per Common Share:           Basic $ 5.32     $ 5.03     $ 4.53   Diluted(3) 5.24     4.97     4.47 (1)  Represents the portion of net income available to common equity allocated to participating securities, composed of unvested and fully vested SERP shares and fully vested deferred director stock awards, which are equity-based awards that contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends, and are considered to participate with the common stock in undistributed earnings. (2)  Represents equity-based awards outstanding but not included in the computation of diluted average common shares, because their effect was anti-dilutive. Refer to Note 18 for additional information about equity-based awards. (3)  Calculations reflect allocation of earnings to participating securities using the two-class method, as this computation is more dilutive than the treasury stock method. Note 24.    Line of Business Information Our operations are organized into two lines of business: Investment Servicing and Investment Management, which are defined based on products and services provided.  The results of operations for these lines of business are not necessarily comparable with those of other companies, including companies in the financial services industry. Investment Servicing provides services for U.S. mutual funds, collective investment funds and other investment pools, corporate and public retirement plans, insurance companies, foundations and endowments worldwide.  Products include custody; product and participant level accounting; daily pricing and administration; master trust and master custody; depotbank services (a fund oversight role created by regulation); record-keeping; cash management; foreign exchange, brokerage and other trading services; securities finance; our enhanced custody product, which integrates principal securities lending State Street Corporation | 179 Table of Contents STATE STREET CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS and custody; deposit and short-term investment facilities; loans and lease financing; investment manager and alternative investment manager operations outsourcing; performance, risk and compliance analytics; and financial data management to support institutional investors. Investment Management, through SSGA, provides a broad array of investment management, investment research and investment advisory services to corporations, public funds and other sophisticated investors.  SSGA offers passive and active asset management strategies across equity, fixed-income, alternative, multi-asset solutions (including OCIO) and cash asset classes.  Products are distributed directly and through intermediaries using a variety of investment vehicles, including ETFs, such as the SPDR® ETF brand. Our investment servicing strategy is to focus on total client relationships and the full integration of our products and services across our client base through cross-selling opportunities.  In general, our clients will use a combination of services, depending on their needs, rather than one product or service.  For instance, a custody client may purchase securities finance and cash management services from different business units.  Products and services that we provide to our clients are parts of an integrated offering to these clients.  We price our products and services on the basis of overall client relationships and other factors; as a result, revenue may not necessarily reflect the stand-alone market price of these products and services within the business lines in the same way it would for separate business entities. Our servicing and management fee revenue from the Investment Servicing and Investment Management business lines, including trading services and securities finance activities, represents approximately 75% to 80% of our consolidated total revenue.  The remaining 20% to 25% is composed of processing fees and other revenue as well as NII, which is largely generated by our investment of client deposits, short-term borrowings and long-term debt in a variety of assets, and net gains (losses) related to investment securities.  These other revenue types are generally fully allocated to, or reside in, Investment Servicing and Investment Management. Revenue and expenses are directly charged or allocated to our lines of business through management information systems.  Assets and liabilities are allocated according to policies that support management's strategic and tactical goals.  Capital is allocated based on the relative risks and capital requirements inherent in each business line, along with management judgment.  Capital allocations may not be representative of the capital that might be required if these lines of business were separate business entities. The following is a summary of our line of business results for the periods indicated. The ""Other"" column for the year ended December 31, 2017 included net acquisition and restructuring costs of $266 million. The ""Other"" column for the year ended December 31, 2016 included net costs of $199 million composed of the following -  Net acquisition and restructuring costs of $209 million; and  Net severance costs associated with staffing realignment of $(10) million. The ""Other"" column for the year ended December 31, 2015 included net costs of $98 million composed of the following -  Net acquisition and restructuring costs of $25 million;  Net severance costs associated with staffing realignment of $73 million.

Non-U.S. Activities We define our non-U.S. activities as those revenue-producing business activities that arise from clients which are generally serviced or managed outside the U.S.  Due to the integrated nature of our business, precise segregation of our U.S. and non-U.S. activities is not possible. Subjective estimates, assumptions and other judgments are applied to quantify the financial results and assets related to our non-U.S. activities, including our application of funds transfer pricing, our asset-and-liability management policies and our allocation of certain indirect corporate expenses.  Management periodically reviews and updates its processes for quantifying the financial results and assets related to our non-U.S. activities. Non-U.S. revenue in 2017, 2016 and 2015 included $1.05 billion, $1.05 billion and $938 million, respectively, in the U.K. The following table presents our U.S. and non-U.S. financial results for the periods indicated: 2017   2016   2015 (In millions) Non-U.S.   U.S.   Total   Non-U.S.   U.S.   Total   Non-U.S.   U.S.   Total Total revenue $ 4,734     $ 6,436     $ 11,170     $ 4,419     $ 5,788     $ 10,207     $ 4,428     $ 5,932     $ 10,360   Income before income taxes 1,230     1,669     2,899     1,047     1,073     2,120     1,193     1,105     2,298 Non-U.S. assets were $82.1 billion and $79.1 billion as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.

This method facilitates the comparison of the performance of these assets.  The adjustments are computed using a federal income tax rate of 35%, adjusted for applicable state income taxes, net of the related federal tax benefit.  The fully taxable-equivalent adjustments included in interest income presented above were $167 million, $167 million and $173 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and were substantially related to tax-exempt securities (state and political subdivisions). (2) Non-U.S. non-interest-bearing deposits were $762 million, $337 million and $95 million as of December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. (3) NIM is calculated by dividing fully taxable-equivalent NII by average total interest-earning assets. State Street Corporation | 185 Table of Contents The following table summarizes changes in fully taxable-equivalent interest income and interest expense due to changes in volume of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, and due to changes in interest rates. Changes attributed to both volumes and rates have been allocated based on the proportion of change in each category.

State Street Corporation | 188 Table of Contents GLOSSARY         Asset-backed securities: A financial security backed by collateralized assets, other than real estate or mortgage backed securities.   Assets under custody and administration: Assets that we hold directly or indirectly on behalf of clients under a safekeeping or custody arrangement or for which we provide administrative services for clients. To the extent that we provide more than one AUCA service for a client's assets, the value of the asset is only counted once in the total amount of AUCA.   Assets under management: The total market value of client assets for which we provide investment management strategy services, advisory services and/or distribution services generating management fees based on a percentage of the assets' market values. These client assets are not included on our balance sheet.  Beacon: A multi-year program, announced in October 2015, to create cost efficiencies through changes in our operational processes and to further digitize our processes and interfaces with our clients.  Certificates of deposit: A savings certificate with a fixed maturity date, specified fixed interest rate and can be issued in any denomination aside from minimum investment requirements. A CD restricts access to the funds until the maturity date of the investment.  Collateralized loan obligations: A security backed by a pool of debt, primarily senior secured leveraged loans. CLOs are similar to collateralized mortgage obligations, except for the different type of underlying loan. With a CLO, the investor receives scheduled debt payments from the underlying loans, assuming most of the risk in the event borrowers default, but is offered greater diversity and the potential for higher-than-average returns.  Commercial real estate: Property intended to generate profit from capital gains or rental income. Our CRE loans are primarily composed of loans acquired in 2008 pursuant to indemnified repurchase agreements with an affiliate of Lehman Brothers.  Doubtful: Loans and leases meet the same definition of substandard loans and leases (i.e., well-defined weaknesses that jeopardize repayment with the possibility that we will sustain some loss) with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full highly questionable and improbable.                                                                                                                                                      Economic value of equity: Long-term interest rate risk measure designed to estimate the fair value of assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet instruments based on a discounted cash flow model.  Exchange-Traded Fund: A type of exchange-traded investment product that offer investors a way to pool their money in a fund that makes investments in stocks, bonds, or other assets and, in return, to receive an interest in that  investment pool. ETF shares are traded on a national stock exchange and at market prices that may or may not be the same as the net asset value.  Exposure-at-default: A parameter used in the calculation of regulatory capital under Basel III. It can be defined as the expected amount of loss a bank may be exposed to upon default of an obligor.  Global systemically important bank: A financial institution whose distress or disorderly failure, because of its size, complexity and systemic interconnectedness, would cause significant disruption to the wider financial system and economic activity, which will be subject to additional capital requirements.  Held-to-maturity investment securities: We classify investments in debt securities as held-to-maturity only if we have the positive intent and ability to hold those securities to maturity. Investments in debt securities classified as held-to-maturity are measured subsequently at amortized cost in the statement of financial position.  High-quality liquid assets: Cash or assets that can be converted into cash at little or no loss of value in private markets and are considered unencumbered. Investment-grade: Loans and leases that consist of counterparties with strong credit quality and low expected credit risk and probability of default.  Ratings apply to counterparties with a strong capacity to support the timely repayment of any financial commitment.  Liquidity coverage ratio: A Basel III framework requirement for banks and bank holding companies to measure liquidity. It is designed to ensure that certain banking institutions, including us, maintain a minimum amount of unencumbered HQLA sufficient to withstand the net cash outflow under a hypothetical standardized acute liquidity stress scenario for a 30-day stress period.  The ratio of our encumbered high-quality liquid assets divided by our total net cash outflows over a 30-day stress period.  Net asset value: The amount of net assets attributable to each share of capital stock (other than senior securities, such as, preferred stock) outstanding at the close of the period.   Net stable funding ratio: The ratio of the amount of available stable funding relative to the amount of required stable funding.  This ratio should be equal to at least 100% on an ongoing basis.   Other-than-temporary-impairment: Impairment charge taken on a security whose fair value has fallen below its carrying value on balance sheet and its value is not expected to recover through the holding period of the security.  Probability-of-default: An internal risk rating that indicates the likelihood that a credit obligor will enter into default status.  Qualified financial contracts: Securities contracts, commodity contracts, forward contracts, repurchase agreements, swap agreements and any other contract determined by the FDIC to be a qualified financial contract.   Risk-weighted assets: A measurement used to quantify risk inherent in our on and off-balance sheet assets by adjusting the asset value for risk. RWA is used in the calculation of our risk-based capital ratios.   Special mention: Loans and leases that consist of counterparties with potential weaknesses that, if uncorrected, may result in deterioration of repayment prospects.  Speculative: Loans and leases that consist of counterparties that face ongoing uncertainties or exposure to business, financial, or economic downturns.  However, these counterparties may have financial flexibility or access to financial alternatives, which allow for financial commitments to be met.  Substandard: Loans and leases that consist of counterparties with well-defined weakness that jeopardizes repayment with the possibility we will sustain some loss.  Supplementary leverage ratio: The ratio of  our tier 1 capital to our total leverage exposure, which measures our capital adequacy relative to our on and off-balance sheet assets.  Total loss-absorbing capacity: The sum of our tier 1 regulatory capital plus eligible external long-term debt issued by us.  Value-at-Risk: Statistical model used to measure the potential loss in value of a portfolio that could occur in normal markets condition, over a defined holding period, within a certain confidence level.   Variable interest entity: An entity that: (1) lacks enough equity investment at risk to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional financial support from other parties; (2) has equity owners that lack the right to make significant decisions affecting the entity's operations; and/or (3) has equity owners that do not have an obligation to absorb or the right to receive the entity's losses or return.

DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES; CHANGES IN INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING State Street has established and maintains disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that material information related to State Street and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis required to be disclosed in its reports filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to State Street's management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. For the quarter ended December 31, 2017, State Street's management carried out an evaluation, with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of State Street's disclosure controls and procedures. Based on the evaluation of these disclosure controls and procedures, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that State Street's disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2017. State Street has also established and maintains internal control over financial reporting as a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements for external purposes in conformity with U.S. GAAP. In the ordinary course of business, State Street routinely enhances its internal controls and procedures for financial reporting by either upgrading its current systems or implementing new systems. Changes have been made and may be made to State Street's internal controls and procedures for financial reporting as a result of these efforts. During the quarter ended December 31, 2017, no change occurred in State Street's internal control over financial reporting that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, State Street's internal control over financial reporting. State Street Corporation | 190 Table of Contents INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting The management of State Street is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements and other financial information contained in this Form 10-K. Management is also responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Management has designed business processes and internal controls and has also established and is responsible for maintaining a business culture that fosters financial integrity and accurate reporting. To these ends, management maintains a comprehensive system of internal controls intended to provide reasonable assurances regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the consolidated financial statements of State Street in conformity with U.S. GAAP. State Street's accounting policies and internal control over financial reporting, established and maintained by management, are under the general oversight of State Street's Board of Directors, including the Board's Examining and Audit Committee. Management has made a comprehensive review, evaluation and assessment of State Street's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017. The standard measures adopted by management in making its evaluation are the measures in the Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the ""COSO criteria""). Based on its review and evaluation, management concluded that State Street's internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2017, and that State Street's internal control over financial reporting as of that date had no material weaknesses. Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, which has audited and reported on the consolidated financial statements contained in this Form 10-K, has issued its written attestation report on its assessment of State Street's internal control over financial reporting, which follows this report. State Street Corporation | 191 Table of Contents Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of State Street Corporation Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting We have audited State Street Corporation's (the ""Corporation"") internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the ""COSO criteria"").  In our opinion, the Corporation maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017, based on the COSO criteria. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (""PCAOB""), the 2017 consolidated financial statements of the Corporation and our report dated February 26, 2018 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. Basis for Opinion The Corporation's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Corporation's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.  We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Corporation in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/ Ernst & Young LLP Boston, Massachusetts February 26, 2018 State Street Corporation | 192 Table of Contents","https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/93751/0000093751-18-000308-index.html"
