      "ORGANIZATION OF MEDALLION FINANCIAL CORP. AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES Medallion Financial Corp. (the Company) is a closed-end management investment company organized as a Delaware corporation. The Company has elected to be regulated as a business development company (BDC) under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the\n",
      "1940 Act). The Company conducts its business through various wholly-owned subsidiaries including its primary operating company, Medallion Funding LLC (MFC), a Small Business Investment Company (SBIC) which originates and services taxicab medallion\n",
      "and commercial loans. A wholly-owned portfolio investment, Medallion Bank, a Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) insured\n",
      "industrial bank, originates consumer loans, raises deposits, and conducts other banking activities (see Note 3). Medallion Bank is subject to competition from other financial institutions and to the regulations of certain federal and state agencies,\n",
      "and undergoes examinations by those agencies. Medallion Bank is not an investment company, and therefore, is not consolidated with the Company, but instead is treated as a portfolio investment. It was initially formed for the primary purpose of\n",
      "originating commercial loans in three categories: 1) loans to finance the purchase of taxicab medallions, 2) asset-based commercial loans, and 3) SBA 7(a) loans. The loans are marketed and serviced by Medallion Banks affiliates who have\n",
      "extensive prior experience in these asset groups. Subsequent to its formation, Medallion Bank began originating consumer loans to finance the purchases of RVs, boats, and other related items, and to finance small scale home improvements. The Company formed a wholly-owned portfolio company, Medallion Servicing Corporation (MSC), to provide loan services to Medallion Bank, also a\n",
      "portfolio company wholly-owned by the Company. The Company has assigned all of its loan servicing rights for Medallion Bank, which consists of servicing taxi medallion and commercial loans originated by Medallion Bank, to MSC, who bills and collects\n",
      "the related service fee income from Medallion Bank, and is allocated and charged by the Company for MSCs share of these servicing costs. The Company also conducts business through Medallion Capital, Inc. (MCI), an SBIC which conducts a mezzanine financing business, and\n",
      "Freshstart Venture Capital Corp. (FSVC), an SBIC which originates and services taxicab medallion and commercial loans. MFC, MCI, and FSVC, as SBICs, are regulated by the Small Business Administration (SBA). MCI and FSVC are financed in part by the\n",

      "(2) SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Use of Estimates The\n",
      "preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the US requires management to make estimates that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and the\n",
      "accompanying notes. Accounting estimates and assumptions are those that management considers to be the most critical to an understanding of the consolidated financial statements because they inherently involve significant judgments and\n",
      "uncertainties. All of these estimates reflect managements best judgment about current economic and market conditions and their effects based on information available as of the date of these consolidated financial statements. If such conditions\n",
      "change, it is reasonably possible that the judgments and estimates could change, which may result in future impairments of loans and other receivables, investments other than securities, loans held for sale, and investments, among other effects.\n",
      "Principles of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, except for Medallion Bank and\n",
      "other portfolio investments. All significant intercompany transactions, balances, and profits have been eliminated in consolidation. As a non-investment company, Medallion Bank is not consolidated with the\n",
      "Company, which is an investment company under the 1940 Act. See Note 3 for the presentation of financial information for Medallion Bank and other controlled subsidiaries. As discussed in Note 19, the Company expects to withdraw its election to be\n",
      "regulated as a BDC under the 1940 Act on or about April 1, 2018 and commencing with the second quarter of 2018, the Company would consolidate the financial statements of Medallion Bank and controlled or majority-owned portfolio investments\n",
      "together with those of the Company. Cash and Cash Equivalents The Company considers all highly liquid instruments with an original purchased maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Cash\n",
      "balances are generally held in accounts at large national or regional banking organizations in amounts that exceed the federally insured limits, and includes $0 and $500,000 related to compensating balance requirements of regional banking\n",
      "institutions, and $0 and $7,840,000 pledged to a lender of an affiliate as of December 31, 2017 and 2016. The reduction in the pledged balances reflects the conversion of the deposit into a loan to the affiliate, and payment in full to the\n",
      "affiliates lender. Fair Value of Assets and Liabilities The Company follows FASB Accounting Standards Codification Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, (FASB ASC 820), which defines\n",
      "fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. FASB ASC 820 defines fair value as an exit price (i.e. a price that would be received to sell, as opposed to acquire, an asset or\n",
      "transfer a liability), and emphasizes that fair value is a market-based measurement. It establishes a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between assumptions developed based on market data obtained from independent external sources and the\n",
      "reporting entitys own assumptions. Further, it specifies that fair value measurement should consider adjustment for risk, such as the risk inherent in the valuation technique or its inputs. See also Notes 2, 16, and 17 to the consolidated\n",
      "financial statements. Investment Valuation The Companys loans, net of participations and any unearned discount, are considered investment securities under the 1940 Act and are\n",
      "recorded at fair value. As part of the fair value methodology, loans are valued at cost adjusted for any unrealized appreciation (depreciation). Since no ready market exists for these loans, the fair value is determined in good faith by the Board of\n",
      "Directors. In determining the fair value, the Board of Directors considers factors such as the financial condition of the borrower, the adequacy of the collateral, individual credit risks, cash flows of the borrower, market conditions for loans\n",
      "(e.g., values used by other lenders and any active bid/ask market), historical loss experience, and the relationships between current and projected market rates and portfolio rates of interest and maturities. Investments other than securities, which\n",
      "represent collateral received from defaulted borrowers, are valued similarly. Equity investments (common stock and stock warrants,\n",
      "including certain controlled subsidiary portfolio investments) and investment securities (US Treasuries and mortgage backed bonds), in total representing 51% and 46% of the investment portfolio at December 31, 2017 and 2016, are recorded at\n",
      "fair value, represented at cost, plus or minus unrealized appreciation or depreciation. The fair value of investments that have no ready market are determined in good faith by the Board of Directors, based upon the financial condition and operating\n",
      "performance of the underlying investee companies as well as general market trends for businesses in the same industry. Included in equity investments were marketable securities of $0 and $537,000 at December 31, 2017 and 2016, and non-marketable securities of $9,521,000 and $7,931,000 in the comparable periods. The $302,147,000 and $293,360,000 related to portfolio investments in controlled subsidiaries at December 31, 2017 and 2016 were\n",
      "all non-marketable in each period. Because of the inherent uncertainty of valuations, the Board of Directors estimates of the values of the investments may differ significantly from the values that would\n",
      "have been used had a ready market for the investments existed, and the differences could be material.  F-8 \n",
      "The Companys investment in Medallion Bank, as a wholly owned portfolio investment, is also\n",
      "subject to quarterly assessments of fair value. The Company conducts a thorough valuation analysis as described previously, and also receives an opinion regarding the valuation from an independent third party to assist the Board of Directors in its\n",
      "determination of the fair value of Medallion Bank on at least an annual basis. The Companys analysis includes factors such as various regulatory restrictions that were established at Medallion Banks inception, by the FDIC and State of\n",
      "Utah, and also by additional regulatory restrictions, such as the prior moratorium imposed by the Dodd-Frank Act on the acquisition of control of an industrial bank by a commercial firm (a company whose gross revenues are primarily\n",

      "fair value hierarchy based on the quality of inputs used to measure fair value, and enhances disclosure requirements for fair value measurements. The Company accounts for substantially all of its financial instruments at fair value or considers fair\n",
      "value in its measurement, in accordance with the accounting guidance for investment companies. See Note 2 sections Fair Value of Assets and Liabilities and Investment Valuation for a description of our valuation methodology\n",
      "which is unchanged during 2017. In accordance with FASB ASC 820, the Company has categorized its assets and liabilities measured at fair\n",
      "value, based on the priority of the inputs to the valuation technique, into a three-level fair value hierarchy. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (level 1) and\n",
      "the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (level 3). Our assessment and classification of an investment within a level can change over time based upon maturity or liquidity of the investment and would be reflected at the beginning of the quarter in\n",
      "which the change occurred. As required by FASB ASC 820, when the inputs used to measure fair value fall within different levels of the\n",
      "hierarchy, the level within which the fair value measurement is categorized is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. For example, a level 3 fair value measurement may include inputs that\n",
      "are observable (level 1 and 2) and unobservable (level 3). Therefore gains and losses for such assets and liabilities categorized within the level 3 table below may include changes in fair value that are attributable to both observable inputs (level\n",
      "1 and 2) and unobservable inputs (level 3). Assets and liabilities measured at fair value, recorded on the consolidated balance sheets,\n",
      "are categorized based on the inputs to the valuation techniques as follows: Level 1. Assets and liabilities\n",
      "whose values are based on unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in an active market that the Company has the ability to access (examples include active exchange-traded equity securities, exchange-traded derivatives, most US\n",
      "Government and agency securities, and certain other sovereign government obligations). Level 2. Assets and\n",
      "liabilities whose values are based on quoted prices in markets that are not active or model inputs that are observable either directly or indirectly for substantially the full term of the asset or liability. Level 2 inputs include the\n",
      "following:     F-33 \n",
      "Level 3. Assets and liabilities whose values are based on prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are\n",
      "both unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement. These inputs reflect managements own assumptions about the assumptions a market participant would use in pricing the assets or liability (examples include certain private\n",
      "equity investments, and certain residential and commercial mortgage-related assets, including loans, securities, and derivatives). A\n",
      "review of fair value hierarchy classification is conducted on a quarterly basis. Changes in the observability of valuation inputs may result in a reclassification for certain assets or liabilities. Reclassifications impacting level 3 of the fair\n",
      "value hierarchy are reported as transfers in/out of the level 3 category as of the beginning of the quarter in which the reclassifications occur. The following paragraphs describe the sensitivity of the various level 3 valuations to the factors that\n",
      "are relevant in their valuation analysis. Medallion loans are primarily collateral-based lending, whereby the collateral value exceeds\n",
      "the amount of the loan, providing sufficient excess collateral to protect against losses to the Company. As a result, the initial valuation assessment is that as long as the loan is current and performing, its fair value approximates the par value\n",
      "of the loan. To the extent a loan becomes nonperforming, the collateral value has been adequate to result in a complete recovery. In a case where the collateral value was inadequate, an unrealized loss would be recorded to reflect any shortfall.\n",
      "Collateral values for medallion loans are typically obtained from transfer prices reported by the regulatory agency in a particular local market (e.g. New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission). Recently, as transfer price activity and the\n",
      "collateral value of medallion loans has declined, and greater weight has been placed on the operating cash flows of the borrowers and the values of their personal guarantees in determining whether or not a valuation adjustment is necessary. Those\n",
      "portfolios had historically been at very low loan to collateral value ratios, and as a result, historically have not been highly sensitive to changes in collateral values. Over the last few years, as medallion collateral values have declined, the\n",

      "and portfolio rates of interest and maturities, as well as general market trends for businesses in the same industry. Since each individual nonperforming loan has its own unique attributes, the factors analyzed, and their relative importance to each\n",

If the Bank determines that the value of an impaired loan is less than the recorded investment in the loan (net of previous chargeoffs,\n",

      "to repay, estimated value of any underlying collateral, prevailing economic conditions, and excess concentration risks. This evaluation is inherently subjective, as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as more\n",

      "the lesser of the estimated useful life of the asset or the remaining lease term. Income taxes  The Bank uses the\n",
      "asset and liability method in providing income taxes on all transactions that have been recognized in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between\n",
